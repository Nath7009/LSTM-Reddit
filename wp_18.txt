 an organism , i think .  she nodded , swiping through the air to bring up the logs .  here . anacondas were south american snakes . large , waterdwelling . they ve been extinct for about two hundred years .  newline newline she waved her hand again , bringing up a series of still images . i swiped through them one by one .  good find ... look at those trees ...  newline newline  is that a monkey in the distance ?  newline newline  yes ,  i said , zooming in .  and the lighting ... it seems artificial .  newline newline  did they have biomes then ?  newline newline  no , of course not ... but this is interesting .  newline newline she scooted to the side as i entered the admin password . the room s humming grew in pitch . the intern was holding her breath . i nudged her with my elbow .  this was earth ,  she whispered . newline newline  yes ,  i said ,  it was .  the trees , the warm sunlight ... it was surreal  magical , even . we sat in silence as the room s humming subsided . i glanced at her .  it s ready . play it at full speed .  newline newline the ambient sounds of the forest and the whistling of an unknown creature bloomed from the speakers . the camera panned down ... newline newline i looked at the intern . she looked at me . we looked at the screen . i opened my mouth to speak . newline newline  what the fuck ... ?  newline newline she nodded .  what the fuck indeed . 4 years had passed . that is how long it has been since i have been fighting this one mother fucker . it has been 4 years since the 3rd last human has died . and now all that is left is this one guy by the name of ted . newline newline i have killed billions . the powers i have attained are immense . my skin is 2 inches thick titanium alloy , i can move almost anything with only my mind , i have the strength of 2000 elephants , i can read my opponents mind , i can fly at near the speed of light , i stand 12 feet tall ... this list goes on and on . newline newline but this last guy ted , he is one level above me and i just ca nt seem to win . it has been 4 years we have fought on this desolate wasteland . we can both output enough destruction that equates to the power of 1000 suns , but we also absorb that same amount . newline newline he refuses to accept my truce . right now he is on the other side of the earth taking a rest . newline newline i am lonely .life has been tough , being so far from home . the war destroyed my country . i could nt bear coming back . it has been ten years since e war , and yet here i was , still mercilessly ruining people s lives . newline newline perhaps the only happy thing in my life was knowing that my cousin has a better life . i keep getting these emails from him , and while it is probably not as good as he describes , at least he is still alive out there . newline newline it is getting unbearable . bulgarin s men are chasing me all over europe like a mouse . i almost lost my life that day , and he thinks i was the one responsible . perhaps it is time to pay my cousin a visit ...i still do nt know quite what to think about that week . neither does foxfire , and it s been over forty years . newline newline for reasons owing to politics , misogyny , diplomatic relationships between duchies , and a wellmeaning but totally misguided attempt by my father to keep my awful uncle s hands to himself , my father , the king , had me sent to a remote cloistered convent called the red tower . as you might imagine , the building is made of red limestone . newline newline the nuns are not the stereotypical humble women in headscarves ... quite the opposite . they are the inconvenient women : too loud , too smart , too powerful , too welleducated , and , well , some of them will never consent to having a husband , if you get what i mean . the powerful men who control the duchy could not keep their control of the duchy if they did nt keep these women quiet , so at the first hint of any sign of independence , the daughters of the wealthy , genteel men get packed up and sent on a red horse  it s traditional  to the red tower , never to enter polite society again . newline newline the nuns  hands are not idle . every inch of the tower is covered in artwork , from carvings and frescoes to tapestries and stunning stone mosaics that one nun from faraway persia made . every inch of the land around the tower is exquisitely tended to , with gardens that my childhood self could only dream of . the animal pens are clean , the animals themselves are all slickcoated and shining . the art , herbs , simples , perfumes , woolens , tapestries , and fine cheeses made by the nuns keep them living in comfort and style . compared to the keep where i grew up , the tower is a palace of luxury . the nuns refused to live in shit like my uncles . newline newline neither the blessed relief of being away from my uncle nor the luxurious surrounds of the tower were the reason i was thrilled  privately , of course  to be sent to the tower . the reason i was thrilled was because i could be educated by the librarian . newline newline the librarian is a dragon . she is the colour of mist , with luminous green eyes matching those of her namesake . she speaks every language known to humans , including many whose last human speaker died before any living human s grandparents were born . newline newline anyway , enough backstory . for everyone s convenience , especially hers , foxfire would take a human shape to walk around the tower . ergonomics are a thing , and after a thousand years at the tower , it was just easier . she was in her human form when the army attacked : stocky , of middling height , with pale skin , hair the colour of mist , and luminous green eyes , wearing the same wool robes as all the rest of us . the only obvious mark that she was a dragon was a line of faint silver scales on her brow , a crown of light . newline newline  my lady , my lady !  newline newline sister clemente shook me awake .  my lady !  newline newline i groaned and rolled over in bed .  what s happening ?  newline newline  the tower is being attacked ,  she hissed .  get up , get dressed , and take shelter .  newline newline that shook the fog of sleep off of me .  who ?  newline newline  someone with gold and green banners ,  she said .  an army , with pikes and horses . get a move on , i have to wake the others .  newline newline i jumped out of bed and started throwing on anything i could get my hands on . newline newline the red tower is wealthy , and this made it a target for thieves . there were numerous defences in place for the casual thief and even bands of roving robbers . armies , though ? if an army came , though ? the plan was to lock down as much as possible , everyone take shelter , and call for help . two hundred nuns ranging in age from sixteen to sixty plus were not a match for foot and horse soldiers , and we all know it . newline newline the stones of the floor were cold beneath my bare feet as i ran for the library . newline newline  hurry , child ,  called foxfire . newline newline  i m coming ,  i panted . newline newline my job was to roll down fireproof metal doors  built by a legendary blacksmith nun some hundred years ago  to keep the books and manuscripts within from burning . four , five , six , seven doors came down . they were heavy and cold and the old metal tore at my hands . newline newline  now what ?  i looked around . there was no food and no water in here . and there was no good way to get to the kitchens and get some . newline newline foxfire sighed .  we wait .  newline newline we waited and waited . i passed the time by looking up heraldry banners to see who was attacking us . no luck ... whoever it was either was nt in the book , or someone got something wrong . newline newline then came the blast . newline newline i woke up on the library floor . it was cold and dark . my head pounded like a chorus of anvils . something sticky matted my hair . newline newline  foxfire ?  i called . newline newline no answer . newline newline  foxfire ? anyone ?  newline newline desperation powered me to my knees . i could nt stand . my head , oh , my head . but i had to get out of here . slowly , tediously , i put one hand in front of the other . then one knee , then the other . even on all fours i swayed and staggered . newline newline  anyone ?  newline newline i made it to the door of the library before everything went black . newline newline ... newline newline three days later , i woke up again , in an unfamiliar bed . newline newline the sheets were coarse , heavy linen . the ceiling was whitewashed . i pawed at my clothes : clean linen robes . not the woolens of the tower . with my other hand , i felt my hair . it was clean and dry . someone must have bathed and dressed me while i was ... not here . newline newline a shadow to my left moved , resolving itself as a lady s maid . not one i remembered . newline newline  are you well , my lady ?  newline newline i considered everything .  no ,  i croaked . newline newline she frowned , and departed . newline newline  where are you going ?  my voice fell flat against the stone floors . the maid did nt answer . newline newline an eternity later , she returned . to my great surprise and joy , foxfire was right behind her . newline newline  student ,  she said . newline newline  you re alive ,  i answered . then i saw her wrists . gold and iron bracelets shone in the morning sunlight . newline newline  you re ... married ?  newline newline the marauding army belonged to the younger son of a duchy two rivers over , who wanted his own chance at a throne . being not too bright , he blasted open the library door and dragged off the unconscious woman with a crown to be married by a complicit priest who did nt seem bothered in the slightest that the bride was limp and drooling . or the fact that the  crown  was an integral part of her skin , instead of removable metal . newline newline  not my most dignified moment ,  foxfire observed . newline newline  did he ... are you ...  my voice trailed off . newline newline  he did ,  she said .  it s what he was expected to do , do nt you know .  newline newline i winced . newline newline  you should have seen the look on his face when i woke up and changed into my true form .  her eyes gleamed . newline newline  oh .  my head hurt too much to think much about it at the time . in hindsight , after i felt better ? goodness . newline newline foxfire smiled . with a lot of teeth .  the priest that married us comes from a religion that says any congress with an animal is a sin unto death .  she tipped up her chin .  i told him , free the tower , or i will see him executed in front of his own family .  newline newline so , that s how it happened . foxfire stayed married to prince guillame , played nice for his father , forced his army to rebuild the tower . generously , she purchased land  with money belonging to the tower funds , but who cares  far enough away from the tower to not be bothered and opened a school for the army men . less generously , and perhaps as a punishment , she chose to bear a pair of daughters  daughters ! so she could have her children close by  by the hapless guillame , further banishing him from his ambitions of power . it would have been breathtaking in its cruelty , except , well , he was the one who raided our home , gravely injured us both , bound her in a contract , and raped her while she was unconscious . i would nt go so far as to say it was wellearned  that was nt fair to foxfire  , but it was certainly a fine example of living well as the best revenge . newline newline as for me , my father found me a scholarly son of a minor lord who had no ambitions for power whatsoever , much to my liking , and arranged us to be married . foxfire came to our wedding , sullen prince and swollen belly and two cheerful daughters and all . my new husband , bless him , was over the moon at meeting a threethousandyearold polyglot polymath who was quite happy to teach him ancient galician texts . and i was able to use my dowry to purchase a smallholding within a day s ride of the tower , so to continue my studies . newline newline a better life than i thought i would have as a young girl .okay , look . i m not proud of what happened . all i m saying is that this did , in fact happen . newline newline so , it was a brisk autumn evening . the sun had just set and the golden leaves of the trees around me were settling down for a good night s sleep . i do nt know why , but i had decided on that particular evening to go to a park and sit on a bench to think . eventually , the park s lamps turned on and i sat there , watching as couples of all kinds walked by . newline newline at one point , i remember sighing to myself and relaxing a bit , and then ... well , it was much later in the night . i had fallen asleep . i m actually not certain what time it was , but i was certain of one thing : i had to pee . i mean , i had so much urinepressure built up , i could hardly think straight , let alone walk any distance comfortably . the trouble was that the lamps in the part had turned off and clouds now covered the sky . i had no way to navigate to the nearest bathroom , but i had to try . newline newline i drew a mental picture in my mind of where i was before i dozed off and where i needed to go . after i was fairly certain i had every detail in my head , i nodded and rose to my feet . the urine in my intestines sloshed back and forth . i could feel the floodgates about to open , but i had to carry forward ! i took a large step and tried to discern the precise distance i could go before the worst case scenario . no matter how i sliced it , i would not make it in time . so i ran . i ran as fast as i could in the darkness of night to the position the washroom should have been . newline newline like all other faulty plans , this one failed abruptly as i ran into a tree . i fell flat on my back before feeling it . warm liquid oozing all over my lower half . i did nt make it . for the first time in my adult life , i wet myself . at least there was no one to see , right ? i thought i could even make it home without anyone knowing . boy was i wrong . i know it sounds weird , but at about midstream , i had the idea of unzipping my fly and peeing away from my person . it made a good amount of sense to me at the time , so i did . newline newline the problem was , i had no idea how much urine was still in my system . some time as i was nearing the end of my urinefountain , my pee began to glow . all of it began to glow . i mean , there was a little green glowing river starting from me and moving in every direction . in the light of my urine , i noticed that a homeless man was on the other side of the tree . to this day , i could not tell you the emotions painted on his face . then i hear it , newline newline  oh ! hail no !  newline newline what ? newline newline  i see water . i come here , and what do i see ?  a rather obese woman , about a foot tall then appeared out of nowhere .  i see a hobo and a boy who peed himself in public . and no ! it does nt matter that it is the middle of the night , boy ! how did you even get yo nastyass piss all over the place ?  newline newline to be clear , i thought i was dreaming . newline newline  look here boy . you are the chosen one  . i m sposed to grant you a wish , and you s supposed save people ... and here you are covered in yo own piss ! how s dat ?  newline newline  look .  i say ,  if you really are going to grant me a wish , then i want a super power .  newline newline  good . here .  she gave me a little necklace .  wear dis . it ll give you power .  newline newline then she was gone . i do nt really understand what happened that night or what my new necklace was supposed to do ... but i m still peeing , and it still glows . i mean , seriously , where is all this urine coming from ? i am like a spring of urine . on the plus side , i have created a perpetual energy machine by peeing directly into a water wheel . that s pretty great .you come up here to get away from it all . you go back because you re lonely . newline newline that s wrong , sure , but it s what was keeping me from eating the barrel of a shotgun for the past two years . newline newline they sent me up here solo . figured i did nt need help . part of me wants to believe it was some sort of prank . probably fred , from accounting .  oh , send kevin ,  he probably said , smiling like a little bitch .  he d love to go up by himself .  newline newline well , guess what , fred ? i m alive and you re a freefloating pile of space waste . so who s laughing now ? newline newline as per safety protocols , there are no weapons up here . no knives or guns or anything like that . there s rope , but there s no gravity to pull me downward into oblivion . so i m stuck up here until i either starve , or get bored enough to vent the airlock . newline newline i m not sure if there were any other manned satellites up here . maybe there were . maybe they see me now , floating up here with nothing to do but stare at this newlyformed cluster of asteroids . newline newline it s odd . i always wondered what would happen to the corpses if something like this occurred , but i always figured i d be too dead to find out . i suppose if i kicked on the satellite s thrusters , i might be able to find out . newline newline but then i might see fred , free floating and cold , a smile frozen eternally on his face . newline newline that might just ruin my day .i felt a tingle run up my neck and down over my head to the tips of my fingers . every hero s story has a climax , there comes a time in every man s life that defines who he is . this was my moment , standing on the precipice of my greatness , becoming the author of my own eulogy . long after my bones wasted away this would be my legacy . my name would forever be untarnished in the immortality of achievement . newline the click of the keyboard filled me with a nearly libidinous excitement as i ran the program for what was possibly the thousandth time but the potential that this could be the final test , the first ever time the skeleton key program would become reality in human history , set a vivacious feeling of intensity pulsing through my arteries . newline the program was meant to simulate the most hardcoded digital security systems in the world and it did it s job perfectly . if my skeleton key could crack this i new it could crack anything . i felt a bead of sweat trickle down my cheek , but i ignored it , all my focus and attention on the process happening in front of me . lines of code streamed past . 57  ... over half way . i felt the anticipation building . 64  ... 78  ... 89  ... the feeling left my fingers and toes as the blood rushed through my body at double speed . i felt the adrenaline rising . 90  ... 92  ... 96  ... this was it . this was my moment . 99  ... 100  ... . newline i had done it ! sitting beneath my quivering fingers was the most powerful piece of equipment created by a human being . i had the ability to topple the united states military . i could control the price of the euro . i could shut down satellites , take control of airports and launch missiles with no more than a few keystrokes . i had reached the top of the technological everest . i was the most powerful man to have ever lived . newline i knew what i had to do . newline i opened a browser window and began to run the program for the first time in a genuine scenario . the process was quick . i had logged onto jessica schellenburg s facebook . newline  i think i have herpies lol  i published her a new status , so all her friends would question her sexual decency . that ll teach her to break my heart . stupid bitch . pshooo !  this was all i did . and i did it a lot . newline ten minutes later , i was finally permitted to stop and take a breath . one of these days i m gon na blow my lungs out . i drank about a litre of water . phew . newline my owner gave me an appreciative smile and proceeded to comb her hair . i glanced at her hair , proud of what i had done . newline my job was nt easy , but hey , someone had to dry her hair . my body would probably fail me in a few years , and i might have to work as a spoon afterwards , given my limited work skills . the upside was , the view was fantastic . and the smell ahh that strawberry on those bright red hair . her beautiful form was reserved only for her husband , but with an intimate job as mine , he had to compromise . newline unfortunately , the worst was when their douchebag of a son  borrowed  me to dry his stinky balls          dropcap  newline newline the thunder of the artillery guns echoed off the cavernous walls like the terrible drums of some titangod , reverberating through the air and through the stone like a cataclysmic storm . gunships and skimmers whirred and danced overhead , streaking in to deliver death from above with roaring guns and screaming missiles before burning away to reload and refuel . the godmachines of war , the titans and imperial knights battled their alien counterparts in duels which eclipsed the struggles of those cowering at their feet . each step destroyed buildings older than mankind , each blast of their dreadful weapons annihilated scores of those unfortunate enough to be caught in their way . the tanks at their feet seemed almost beetlesize in comparison , tossed aside like playthings in explosions of plasma and more arcane weapons . newline newline amongst it all the guardsmen of the mortanis 9th  light  fought , almost an afterthought amid the fury of titans looming above them . task with advancing through the ruins of the vast underground city , their objective was simple and brutal : kill all who opposed them . newline newline already they had liberated a third of the massive cavern , an achievement hard won through blood and sacrifice . the mortanis 9th had not been among the first assault  those who first breached the cave entrance and died to establish a toehold in the city . they had seen the rows of dead , the ranks of graves being dug in the grey soil . and now they fought and died to join them . newline newline   newline newline corporal willem locke slid behind cover right as the enemy opened up with a heavy weapon platform . the eldar guardians , clad in the grey and red of their craftworld unleashed a lethal storm of razor sharp shuriken rounds . the monomolecular blades hissed through the air and embedded themselves deep into whatever they hit be it stone or flesh . locke heard a scream and he glanced back , watching as private raglen was sliced apart in a mist of blood and flickering blades . he fell lifeless , his carapace armor of little use against the rending shuriken blades of their foes . newline newline locke swore and fired blind around the corner of his column , not caring if he hit anything or not . the rest of his platoon were scrambling for cover of their own , lascarbines firing in an effort to pin down the eldar . the grey armored guardians only increased their fire , each with decades or even centuries of experience behind each shot . lieutenant holt , crouched behind a weathered stature was busy shouting into the vox , clamoring for support even as another one of his soldiers was hit , a razorthin shuriken blade sunk between his surprised eyes . newline newline   this is kiloalpha six , requesting support in grid threethreesigmatwo . we got eldar dug in tight . requesting armor support , over .   newline newline locke was too far away to hear the reply , but considered how the lieutenant slammed the vox onto its cradle it s likely the news was nt good . newline newline   slag it ... listen up , guards ! sergeant rutger ! take your squad and try to flank these sons of bitches . the rest of you , advance by section .  newline newline rutger , his jaw replaced with a bionic enhancement after an unlucky meeting with a heretic s shotgun nodded and halfrose , careful to keep himself out of the line of fire . newline newline  alright , boys , you heard the elltee s orders . up and at em !  newline newline locke , promoted to corporal after harlan s untimely demise during the battle of the red river gorge , obeyed despite whir of fire buzzing like angry hornets above his head . newline newline  my fireteam , with me !  newline newline the other three soldiers next to him nodded and followed , using every piece of scant cover to hide themselves as they worked their way to the left side of the battle . overhead a flight of vulture gunships blazed in , rockets streaking out of their underslung pods at some unseen target a klick behind the front line . locke took that as a bad sign . newline newline locke wore the same dark blue coveralls and black light carapace of the rest of the mortanis 9th , a black balaclava hiding most of his features . he and two others of his fireteam carried modified holt model 6 lascarbines , the already lightweight weapons shrunk so as to make them more compact and easier to wield in the tight confines of the ninth s favorite environment . the fourth , private lynch , carried the team s flamer , a weapon perfect for this war of rats . newline newline the four of them slipped into a deserted building , its once proud staircase and hallway little more than a deserted tomb , the bones of its previous inhabitants strewn across the marble floor . a few banners , leeched of color and design hung like moss overhead , swaying every so often with another nearby shock blast . locke motioned for venton and fuller to take point , the pair covering each other as they advanced through the abandoned hallway . the entire city was one massive construct , each building linked to the ones next to it through a series of tunnels and bridges , each block a fortified castle in its own right . newline newline a hole in the building s face brought the noise and sights of battle to their attention , their platoon slowly but surely making their way up through the barrage of fire . a chimera ifv had joined the fight , its autocannon firing as sergeant veer s squad marched behind it . locke and his team sprinted across the gulf that was the opening in the wall , praying that they had nt been spotted as they dashed between cover . no fire came their way , no guardians shifted to block them . a small piece of luck . newline newline a query over his microbead told him where the other fireteam of their squad was  directly overhead with the squad s heavy bolter . locke made his way closer to the eldar line , crawling into a small shellhole made in the wall by an artillery round . he was close , able to hear the aliens chatter through the artificial static of their helms . fuller and venton were next , peeking over the rim of the shellhole in wary eagerness . flametrooper lynch was last , the tanks mounted on his back gurgling full . newline newline  any last words ?  locke asked . fuller raised a hand . newline newline  yeah , why the slag does it have to be us ? i feel like i have been flying through the air forever . newline how long ago was that car crash ? i guess my tire fell off and my car did nt really act well after that , and the car behind me ... i was spinning through the air , i remember because all of the change in my cupholders were hitting me in the face , and my first thought was to be glad that i did nt smoke anymore or else i d probably be on fire.. newline newline it is as if time was slowed down , the shards of glass were coming toward me slowly , like i could dodge them if i ducked below the wheel , but my body was moving slowly , too , and i saw the terrified faces of the pedestrians as my car barrel rolled through the air.. newline newline  momma ?  newline newline that snapped me out of my reverie . the sound of my sweet , seven year old son , jack , my sweet , sweet boy . he had his father s freckles and my caramel eyes , and his cute little mess of curls were as blonde as could be . newline newline but when i woke up , it was not my seven year old that was staring back at me . it was.. it looked like him , but.. newline newline  mom ?  a deep voice , deeper than my boy s . the man it belonged to had caramel eyes , freckles dotting over his nose and below his eyes , a very chiseled face with creased lines on the forehead and a dirtyblonde stubble . the hair on his head was blonde and curly like soft little ringlets , still long , pulled back into a short ponytail , with strands dangling into his face . he was handsome , that boy , and i felt confused , not attracted to him , but that i loved him very much . newline newline  who.. are ... you ?  newline newline  i m jack . i m your son . you were going to die when i was seven . i m thirty seven now , it has been thirty years , and i ve finally gotten you back . you ve been asleep for a long , long time .  newline newline i was quiet . newline newline  how did i almost die ?  newline newline he cleared his throat and laid his hands on the bed i was laying in . there was a silver wedding band on his left hand .  you survived a car crash , but then you went into cardiac arrest .  i saw tears in his eyes .  it s been a long thirty years , mom..  i looked down at my body . it looked no different than i remember . newline newline  of course.. you re still only.. twenty seven..  he cleared his throat again .  you re how old ?  i asked . newline newline  thirty seven .  newline newline  you re ten years older . and you re married !  i gestured to the ring on his finger .  married ! !  newline newline he smiled .  you re a grandma , too , you know .  newline newline a grandma at twenty seven . i nearly fainted . newline newline  where is your father ?  i asked . he coughed uncomfortably .  dad kind of gave up on this whole thing . he said it was no use , it would nt work , he did nt want false hope.. he s at home , i imagine .  newline newline  mom , he is thirty years older than he was when you last saw him..  newline newline  i m dreaming are nt i ? i should just wake up any time now .  i pinched my arm . ow . newline newline  i ll call him if you want me to..  he pulled out a device i did nt recognize . newline  what year is it ?  newline newline  2044 .  newline newline i blinked . no it is nt . i m only 27 in 2044 . i should be in my late fifties ! my own son is ten years older than me ! newline newline  did you go to school ? college ? where do you work ? what is your wife s name ? your children ? how many ?  newline newline  dad is on his way . i sent him a message . as for all that , yes . i went to a really great college overseas for eight years , studying in science and medicine , so that i could bring you back into the world . i suppose you could call me a scientist . i m a professor over at harvard . my wife is called allison and our children are two twin girls and a boy . marzia , jade , and adam .  newline newline in walked an elderly man . newline newline  dad ! you got here quickly .  newline newline i looked up at the husband i left behind . he looked unfamiliar to me .  jjason ?  i stared and stared . his cheeks were stained with tears . his pretty eyes were glossed over . freckles on his face were still there.. newline newline  jason , our son has more education than me ! he has three kids !  newline newline the old man nodded and wiped his eyes .  kkat ,  he began .  i did nt think . i never thought you d come back..  newline he broke down at the side of my bed and then looked up at me through sobs . newline newline and i looked into his eyes and suddenly , he was so familiar . the man i love . newline newline but i did nt know what to say . newline newline i turned to my son .  you know..  newline newline  you should have just let me die . it was the night before christmas in the small town of renton , a quiet town where poor , old citizens of seattle came to retire , and everyone in the moore household had tuned in for the night . the boozy eggnog had flowed like a river , the magic cookies wet everyone  s appetite , and the main dishes which consisted of lovely roasted pineapple ham , tamales and a spiked chocolate cheesecake , had left most powerless to make it past three a.m. once the final guests of the moore household had said their goodbyes , it was time for the host  s family to go to bed and await the arrival of the fat bearded man who comes only once a year . newline newline  good night , we love you  slurred papa and mama moore to their sweet little 30 year old girl . newline newline  good night guys  she slurred back , embracing her progenitors and kissing her sister goodnight . newline newline once every soul besides her own had been tucked away nicely into a warm bed , sally decided she would put the food left overs away before they gifted the house with a jolly though rancid smell on christmas morning . not long after putting the ham in the fridge and some magic cookies on the table sally heard a noise coming from the chimney . without a second thought she hid behind the couch beside the christmas tree , hoping to catch a glimpse of the most interesting man in the world . scratching from the chimney became louder , louder , louder until she heard a bump . newline instead of the scratching , stepping noises filled the room . but these were very light steps , at least for what was supposed to be a morbidly obese man . finally a shape appeared beside the tree ! newline a very wrong shape indeed ! newline a shape which in no way matched what the legends said about the old , fat man ! newline newline the man standing beside the tree was young , lean and shirtless . it matched the greek ideal of male beauty in every way possible . santa was so beautiful and radiant that his skin seemed to glow against the lights of the lights of the tree , making the situation unbearable . newline newline  who the fuck are you and what have you done with santa ? !  politely exclaimed our heroine . abercrombie santa raised a perfect eyebrow , while flashing a dazzling smile . newline newline  why , i am he that brings presents and smiles to those who have been good all year round.  exclaimed santa with a faint spanish accent . ever the subtle one , sally presented her objections . newline newline  you are not fat.  newline newline  it is a lie spread by me to keep the paparazzi away.  santa waved a hand dismissively . newline newline  you are young.  newline newline  i am one of the immortal guardians of the universe . i am incapable of aging , having stopped at the apex of my youth in my twenties , centuries ago.  newline newline  you are not white.  newline newline  i  ve no idea who said i was.  newline newline  you have no shirt.  newline newline  i get warm quite quickly . my superpowers make it nearly impossible for me to feel cold or pain so i find that being on the nude is quite comfortable , although not appropriate for the job.  newline newline santa was no lying . his chest was glistening from slightly sweating inside the house . he had to be the most beautiful man sally had ever laid eyes on . against her own will she took a step towards santa , plucking her lips , unable to fight his raw animal magnetism . sexy santa took a step back , stretching an arm toward sally . newline newline  sorry , you are not my type . i like tall , fit women who are good all year round . you are short , barely in shape and drink too much . in fact i came here to bring you some sticks and coals.  newline newline stunned , sally walked towards the table in the living room , carefully picking up the gourmet cannacookies as she headed for bed . santa was simply another douche . newline newline minutes later , once satisfied with his work regarding sticks and coal , santa was ready to leave . newline before departing he glimpsed a picture of sally on the chimney , taking it with him as he left . newline he had been tempted to give her the kiss of death , stealing what was left of her lifespan by adding it to his own but had taken pity on her instead as he knew all about her recent divorce from her secretly gay husband . her life was his gift to sally for christmas . newline smiling to himself santa got in the red ferrari parked on the roof of the house and flew away . newlinewhen he came to , the first thing he noticed was the burn created by his seatbelt . it was the smell that tipped him off before the pain . the smell of burnt flesh , the friction from the seatbelt scorching his left arm as his jeep rolled and rolled until it finally stopped upside down near the side of the road . newline newline he was nt sure how many times the jeep had turned over on itself , but it could nt have been less than three . and it s upside down now , so at least three and a half , he thought . newline newline the roof above him had collapsed , enough to prevent him from turning to his right . and then the realization hit him with a thud . she was in the seat next to him . newline newline it was their fourth date . the first three had gone increasingly well . they met at his friend s band gig . she was sitting at the bar , waiting for the bartender to acknowledge her existence and fill her glass with a scotch ale . his friend was the bassist in the band . her s was the drummer . they ran into each other several more times that night . newline newline now she s sitting next to him in the passenger seat , upside down , deafeningly quiet . the collapsed roof prevents him from turning to her , and he s almost relieved . it s been maybe 10 seconds since they came to a stop , and he s too afraid to ask her if she s ok , because he s afraid she s not . newline newline so he listens . newline newline and all he hears is a drip . then another . and another . such a basic rhythm has never terrified a man so much . newline newline drip , drip , drip . newline newline as he looked down at the neat line of blood slowly flowed past him on the car s ceiling , which was now below him , he knew he had to say something . anything . newline newline  jen ? jen , are you ok ?  newline newline drip , drip , drip . newline newlinetonight is my first meeting . i sat cross legged , indian style , the way a child might thumbing through a magazine . i am trying not to think about it . to be frank about it , there is nothing stopping me from not staying in . i am not dying , i am not addicted to some stimulant , some hard drug that will take me in the end . i hardly drink . but my wife . she had other ideas . lucie . she thought it was pretty cool . what kid wouldn  t ? newline newline  jon , your stupid fish are ruining our marriage  sara would yell . i am not really a yeller , i rather talk about things , yelling does nothing for no one . but sara . i am sure at some point our marriage was good , but like everything it came to an end , and we both tried to grasp to the corpse that once was and hang on . to clear up , fish are actually not stupid , while many people think they are , and have a felting seven second memory , it is very much not the truth . i have several fish that do tricks . they are like aquatic dogs . very rad stuff . newline newline now that sara has left , which was on her accord not mine . she said keep the house . which was ok by me , at this point i was rather over the fighting . however when she left she said some choice words , along the lines of  you chose fish over your family  and  until you get rid of those dumb things you won  t see your daughter.  actually that is pretty much what she said , i am sure there was more , but those are the two things that stick out the most . newline newline i did do father things with lucie , we had a lot of fun . i thought she should have a hands on approach , a bit what people call free range as well , and sara was more hovering , she had to have a set schedule and could not do this that or the other . if she could the child in a bubble she would . i guess that was the start of it , and the fish were control . but apparently it is not ok to spend several hours tinkering with a filter or some equipment that needs fixing , getting the ph levels just right . like i am talking perfect . it had to be perfect always . making sure the plants and bits for the self sustaining ecosystem i have going are ok or spending hours making sure the fish i just got does nt have dropsy . it may have had it before i got it , and the treatment is work . change its water every three days by twentyfive percent and get the water quality up , should that not work use meds . some people spend years on train sets . i have fish . kill me . newline newline as it turns out , you can  t make money from this hobby . that is what i call it . it has drained me . emotionally and financially i have a good job , but i have so many fish that food and maintenance is taking my extra money . friends say  wan na go out man ?  i always have to shuffle my feet and answer in a way that is awkward , because a lot of the time i just don  t have the funds . there are times , very deep inside in my heart , in a place no one will ever find . that i wish it was opposite . i get that feeling sometimes . it goes as fast as it comes . newline newline i started selling some old things lying around on ebay . i thought they would be fast cash . you hear stories . but i was wrong . it is not as easy as it sounds . i guess you have to know how to market . i do not have this skill , but i am very substitutable to marketing , if only i knew how it worked . newline newline a close friend of mine , keith , who ironically used to do a bit of hard drugs . i say a bit , but i am being nice about it . he stopped me last week and said in the blunt way he says everything  jonny man ,  he said patting my back . i guess i was looking bad , sara and i got into a fight as i wanted to take lucie to the museum . she asked about the fish and if they were still in my possession in a tone implying she still hated me and fish on a level that was equal , which was rather high .  i never thought i would have to say these words to you , or about fish , but man , you have a problem.  i was a bit offended really , i told him waving my hand , that it was in fact just a hobby and nothing more .  man , hobbies to split families.  he had a point , i was living in a fool s paradise . or anyone who liked sushi . i used to like sushi once . newline newline so with the push of keith who told me about how he kicked drugs and the groups and talks and how everyone supports each other . how you might fall back but you just get right back up . he told me all of it down to the really bad juice and stale cookies . he said we would start monday , get rid of one tank and go to a meeting . just to test the water . i agreed . newline newline as i sat on the floor cross legged , indian style , the way a child might thumbing through a magazine , there was a knock on the door , pulling me from my anxious , wondering thoughts . it was keith who had a friend who was looking for a aquarium and fish . newline newline after showing of the gent i would never see again , with the fish i was know cutting ties with and one less thing in my life and a bit of money in my pocket , i looked to keith ,  your house always makes me wants sushi  he said as i locked up .  i could go for some , i will buy.  i agreed . the sushi was the best start to a long recovery from my addiction to live fish . newline newline newlineas soon as i stepped foot outside the vault i teleported . i would have left a long time ago if i could ve figured a way out . i knew it was dangerous . although i was teleporting to one of the hubs which should in theory have been protected , the effects of the  glitch  had nt exactly been predictable . newline newline i guess it had been a while since personal safety had been a concern of mine . newline newline it was deserted , like i d expected . i d heard the president had reactivated a few before they d let everyone out , beginning to establish some order in this strange world we now lived in . you know when a wizards think things are weird they are . still they were a spoilt lot . but with the resources they had now i figured they d have skipped this one . i checked my wristband , glitch levels were minimal . newline newline was that a pang of disappointment i d felt ? had i hoped something would go wrong ? newline newline i had nt really thought past that point . i considered staying at the hub , but if i was just going to just going to do nothing what was the point of running away ? i managed to boot up the computer system at the hub but a quick glance showed the maps and data were nt much different than the ones we had in the vault . i figured i d download copies to my wristband just in case , i also downloaded all the movies and books that had nt been on the vault system . newline newline i did nt really want to be with people so i m not sure why i checked for signals , i did nt find any . newline newline i loaded up on supplies , mostly rations and power packs , they d been limited in the vault , then i set out . newline newline i had no idea where i was going , i guess i just hoped i d find a reason to stay alive .the night was harsh and cold . as i tossed and turned in my solid bed , my eyelids would nt snap shut . the howling of the snow storm grew louder and louder , until i could stand it no more . i stepped out of bed , and peeled back the mothbitten curtains to my room . newline newline the white blur of snow stunned me at first . it was as if drifting on a cloud . yet this cloud was more violent and aggressive . for a moment , i stood there , motionless . the glass was cold to touch , and my cursed window just had to be ajar on a night like this . typical . newline newline the storm is beginning to calm now . it is nt so much of a hurricane as ait is a gentle breeze . i could appreciate the beauty of winter now . dazzling street lights began to shine through now . i became absorbed with this idyllic scene . the countryside lay thick with the soft powder . newline newline and that s when i heard it . newline newline a muffled thud startled me . i awoke from my trance , and peered around my bedroom . yet , everything seemed in order . none of my porcelain dolls had fell from their glass cases on the shelf . none of my pillows had moved an inch . i began to stare out of the window again . until a brown speck appeared on the ground outside , a blemish in my perfect scene . newline newline it was a book . newline newline a book ? how did it get there ? i needed to answer those questions . without haste , i grabbed my rubber wellies from the foot of my bed . they were the classic khaki colour . newline newline outside , the frost cut into my cheeks like knives . my sharp , painful breaths were forced . the book lay there , as if it were calling for me . the cover was made of a fine leather . it s brown material was encrusted with rubies , sapphires and many vibrant gemstones . this had to be worth much more than i could afford ... yet nobody was around . it could ve come from anywhere . newline newline but now was not the time to be hesitant . what was in those yellowed pages ? i turned back the front cover , my eyes hungrily scanning the contents . newline newline it was empty . newline newline my smile was turned into a frown . i rapidly turned the pages , each as blank as the next . the back of the book did nt shed any light either . there was no blurb , no table of contents . nothing . it might be a journal , perhaps . feeling my heart sink , i left it on my front porch . hopefully , the owner retrieves it . newline newline i did nt see the book disappear into the dark night . newline newline 13  completed  answer selected : 3 newline newline doing what you do best , you use your strengths to your advantage and bring ted along for the ride . as a silverback gorilla , your physical strength is maximized , but after a while , begin to fatigue . you ve been walking for miles underground and have no idea where this path is leading you . feeling quite dizzy ,

. that was 5 years ago . newline newline everyone who was nt old or weak was forced to draft . woman , man , children 14 years and older were forced to fight for food . but then the volcano erupted . newline newline there was so much ash and dust , barely anyone could breath . the huge ash clouds covered the sky . there was no sunlight left . almost instantly people were freezing , the wounded were dying fast . there was so much coughing and crying as we watched the last ray of sunlight get blotted out . the ash falling into our eyes . newline newline the world government promised that they would fix this . but animals and plants started to die and the oceans started to freeze . scientists promised it would all be gone in a few days . but we waited . millions and billions of people died in the cold . their livestock had died and froze . no amount of heat could thaw the precious meat . newline newline i m one of the last 6 billion , clinging to survival , living in the remains of

out his monthly shift at the terminal , hoping to restore contact with earth ground control . he though it was a waste of time , spending hours trying to breathe life into this hunk of junk after not transmitting to or for earth for 103 years . he could be doing anything else really , because this exercise in futility was really getting on his nerves . newline newline running down the checklist of what to do , he checked the cables and wires in the monitor , brushed off the dust that stuck to the screen , and flipped the bright red control switch . all of the sudden , the computer began to hum and spirt , hot air blasting out the ducts before the screen turned into monotone green .moving day was going to be a chore . matt looked out at the rows and rows of boxes . some to be donated , some to be thrown away , and others to go to their new home . it would be worth it though . the house they were moving from was huge , and they did nt really need all that extra space they were paying for , not since their eldest son luke had moved in with his friend . newline newline their youngest son mark sat playing on his playstation . they d chosen to keep that plugged in until the last minute to keep him distracted . mark had been a little quiet since the night luke moved out , although he did seem to perk up a little when he had that little headset on so he could chat with his friends . matt often heard him muffled through the wall . newline newline his wife mary had been a complete scatter brain while they d been packing . she kept moving boxes from the trash and donate piles to the moving pile . or even stranger , to a corner of the garage . the new owners would be here the day after tomorrow , and matt doubted they d have much use for boxes of old jeans and cd s . newline newline matt loaded the boxes into the truck taking extra care with the family portrait . he d noticed the glass in the frame had a tendency to shift around when he d picked it up the week before and he did nt want it to break on the way to their new home . he had a place picked it out for it , right in the entrance way . he could nt wait for all his friends to see it at the housewarming on sunday evening . newlineit started out innocently enough . the friendly commercials that spouted the amazing truth ... newline newline do you ever wish to live a life ... and another ... and another ? well , wish no more ! try vivadoz ! one pill , taken before bedtime , will allow you to dream an amazing adventure , and wake up refreshed and ready to tackle the day !  newline newline vivadoz was a hit , of course . everyone wanted to escape their every day , and have an adventure , all without leaving their home . newline newline the idea is this : you take the pill , and then think about where you want to be , what you want to be doing ... and the vivid dreams begin while you sleep . better than a star trek holodeck . kayaking in a mountain valley ? flying a fighter jet ? exploring mars ? watching a supernova up close ? newline newline nothing was off limits . whatever you could dream up , the pill would give you ... all you have to do is get 68 hours to do it . newline newline but then ... oh , the insidiousness of the pleasure that pill gave people . the drug companies knew what they were doing . they were like pushers . they were damn near giving the drug away as soon as the fda trials were over . the pharmas made an absolute killing selling the thing . and the best part ? no after effects were observed . no danger . completely harmless . just awesome sleep , right ? newline newline yes , absolutely ! incredible sleep . more than anything else , sleep was the best thing a person could do in their life now . the drug was everywhere . if you wanted it , you got it . and you slept . wake up ... get some food , take a pee break ... then sleep , and another adventure . newline newline nobody kept track of anyone else ... anything else ... because everyone wanted to sleep . everywhere . nobody escaped the lure of the pill . newline newline and then ... it happened . someone figured out the formula ... and it was simple . kids could make it ... and did . everyone did . newline newline and so that was that ... the world ended . newline newline well , not literally , earth s still orbiting the sun . animals are still about . but there s not many humans living anymore . i m one of the lucky bastards ... if you want to call me that ... that survived the slumbering . newline newline see , when people do nothing but sleep ... then they forget things need tending . power plants , for one . food supplies for another . people kept neglecting things . oh , sure , crime went way the hell down , but that s little consolation when a nuclear power plant runs out of people to run it . or a forest fire happens and nobody s around to put the fire out . or nobody wants to be a nurse anymore . newline newline they tried to control things , but people rioted to get their pills . struck too . no work until pills happened . newline newline a sad statement on humanity , really . newline newline so everything , everywhere , fell apart . once a society got the pill , it was over . just a matter of time . and no society ever , ever escaped the lure . from the politicians , to the armies , to the people in the streets and everyone everywhere in between . the pill was humanity s abomination . newline newline and in the horror of what we d done to ourselves ... we  chose to take some more ... to forget reality ... to forget the pain of living in the real world ... and we died as a viable , modern society . either animals ate us as we slept , blissfully unaware of our being consumed ... or we starved as food ran out , but we dreamed . newline newline the remainders , as we call ourselves , do nt really know why we resist ... perhaps it s our statement to the universe that we will not go quietly ... or something ... i do nt really know anymore . and i ve kind of had enough of the harsh life i ve been living since the world fell apart ... newline newline so today , i made a batch . i told myself i would nt , but ... i miss my family . jessica

thanks for the great prompt !it had been two months since waldo had begun processing and comparing the combined digital history of the parallel universes . cheekily named after the character from the popular book series , waldo was the product of months of planning by top ai engineers and data processing technicians . using google and local information from databanks all over the globe , waldo would take the top 100 recurring keywords for a search in order to create a hexidecimal code to represent the profile for all events in history , famous people , biological processes , george clooney s internet history , foods on a stick , 1 star restaurants on yelp , lists of medical burn centers in the united states , superhero prompts on a subreddit , and trillions of pieces of information that comprised the recorded digital collection of humanity s understanding of the known universe . newline newline many bottles of champagne were popped over the creation of the project and now , both parallel universes had nothing to do but wait as waldo silently carried out its sole purpose . newline newline  dunnigan , where s waldo at ?  newline newline originally meant as a joke from his supervisor , the question became a source of frustration for both as days turned to weeks and weeks turned to months . media interest had already moved on to a famous celebrity divorce , as waldo continued its process diligently with no end in sight . newline newline  well , sir , same as yesterday . no change in activity levels .  newline newline  alright , well let me know if anything happens , i guess .  newline newline  sure thing .  newline newline craig dunnigan minimized the processing usage tools that tracked waldo s level of activity and resumed playing fallout 4 . newline newline  another fat man ? come on ...  beep newline newline  hm ?  newline newline craig alttabbed out of the game to see that the activity readout , which had until now remained relatively constant , had taken a sharp decline in the last ten minutes . newline newline  walt ... walt ! get in here !  newline newline he heard the sound of chair wheels sliding , a door opening , and then running footsteps . newline newline  what happened ?  newline newline  it ... appears waldo s finished .  newline newline  alright , well where s the anomaly ? pull up the data .  newline newline after a couple of clicks , craig had pulled up the master sync list . newline newline  what am i looking at ?  newline newline  well , these columns are every bit of information that was processed , but in order to save space , the information that matches up exactly is compressed and categorized . so any anomalies are going to take up more space since waldo intentionally has no process for dealing with search terms that do nt have exact keyword matches . so i just have to sort by size ... let s give it a minute . and there it is . this code . this is the difference .  newline newline  well , what is it ?  newline newline  it s in the beta column which means it s something in their world that we do nt have . waldo is loading up relevant local files as we speak ... damn , this is exciting ! ok so it appears that the relevant files were nt a search term but local files . and ... they come from the united states federal government ! well theirs , not ours . file source seems to be ... well ... the department of defense ... no , it ca nt be . they re plans to ... oh , god , help us . as arthur settled himself into the stiff canvas of the deckchair , his toe happened upon something small and cold within the grass . he sat up sharply . brian turned to face the sudden motion . newline newline  what s the matter now ?  he smirked . newline newline  there s something down there , i think !  exclaimed arthur , pointing accusingly at the ground . newline newline brian drew himself laboriously out of his chair , with much sighing , and knelt down . he turned his hands roughly through the grass , then stopped and peered closer . newline newline  oh , what s this ?  he queried aloud , before raising his hand . a short , delicate metal chain dangled from between his thick fingers like a strand of silver hair . the other end was still attached to something , concealed by the grass . without a second thought , he gave the chain a sharp tug , and felt the something at the other end give way . newline newline  what is it ?  asked arthur , now getting up out of his own chair to take a closer look . newline newline as he stood up , there was a noticeable rumbling sound . brian looked at arthur s stomach . newline newline  there s no need to look at me like that !  protested arthur indignantly .  it was nt me ! it came from down there with you .  newline newline lifting his hand , brian dangled the chain in the air between the two men . at the other end wobbled a black , plastic plug , three inches across . the rumbling sound had morphed into a kind of deep gurgle , and was steadily increasing in volume while a gentle breeze began to blow . newline newline  whoops .  said brian .it had been weeks , months , years . i did not know anymore . i had been searching for so long . as i strode around the ruins of new york city , where the last masks where supposed to be buried under the rubbles , i could not help but look back on the tiresome journey i had accomplished so far . many encounters , many losses , more losses even . after what we bare faces like to call the beginning , humanity suddenly became individualistic . the rare troups of bfs i had crossed path with during my epic journey were bound to dissolve , the process often occurring before my very eyes . the power of attraction of the masks does not go well with groups of people . in the end , there is only one person who can have it . the others fated to begin the cycle again , or disband . newline newline i had followed the rumors , from boston to chicago , from chicago to philly , from philly to new york , and back , so many times . everybody knows that the quest in long but not vain , at least for a few of us , the lucky ones . but there are nt many bfs left now , at least not active . most of them have taken to the undergroud , this restricted facility the guys at cern were secretely working on . its size unfathomable , its magnetic properties making it a safe haven for bfs everywhere . i knew the access points to join it , but i also knew i still had mask fever . i could not give up . newline newline with the disappearance of most of the competition after all these years , the hunt had become easier , but somehow even more dreadful . walking around the wastelands , searching for the magnetic signature of the masks with the detector , exhausted all day , lonely all night . the masked ones still roam certain regions  but nobody can confirm it  , but they have mostly deserted the wastelands . most of them now rule over empty areas all over the world , their power unlimited , their subjects inexistant . for some reason they re alone . newline newline i was going along madison avenue , one of the few streets still manageable on foot . i knew my detector would not last long , but i did not care anymore . a rumor had started , not only the usual one about a peak of magnetic activity in this or that region of the world , causing all bfs still active to gather there . i had heard from someone that the detector was useless . that we did not pick up any of the masks  signatures . no , it was something else , something that could change the whole hunt for ever if i could prove it , for myself . newline newline it s said that the masked ones are not all devoid of interest for the bfs . it s said that the ones that did not become omnipotent and powercrazed chose to stay attached to the places they lived in before they ascended to another state of conscience , before the symbiotic mask turned them into selfish , immortal , mostly harmless gods on this earth harmless as long as you did nt live in an area they ruled over . someone said only a masked one can find a mask and grant it to a bf , and that the transitivity of it all first began when they excavated the first mask inside the mojave desert . our first god , a woman , was said to have started the first lineage of masked ones . how this information had remained unknown to the rest of humanity so far was baffling , and i did not put all my remaining eggs in this crazy basket . but the mask historian i had talked it out with was pretty convinced . before the fall of all civilizations , before the mojave black hole , the disappearance of japan and the complete destruction of all electronic apparatus , this man had tried to follow the pattern of the gods  appearances . he had crossreferenced all ground zero events , even the most ridiculous ones , to the background checks on the people known to have become masked ones . he found pairs , sometimes triplets of gods originating from roughly the same areas . masked ones created masked ones , according to him . i had nothing to lose , and i had heard crazier theories . newline newline my coming back to new york , my hometown , had not been uneventful . one of the last troups of bfs had sheltered me for a while , before going mad and ripping itself appart , its members succombing to the awful paranoia the newly imposed world order  or disorder  and surperimposed crazy magnetic fields inevitably triggered amongst groups of two and more human beings . the masks completely screw the brain s chemistry , and the initial instinct of grouping ourselves for survival is sure to slowly transform into a greedinfused paranoia over the remaing masks , even if the group had swore to never take part in the quest . poor bastards were probably contaminated by my mere presence . nobody really knows how it works , which is why people still try to form troups . guess i ca nt blame them . now i was walking along the path i used to take to go to work , unsure of what i was going to find . i knew there were other lone bfs in the area , new york is never really deserted , even if the magnetic fields are supposed to overlap even more near important ground zeros . and new york had its share , between the tsunami and the asteroids rain . but it was my last chance , i did not care anymore that the fields could make me even crazier , greedier . i wanted to know , or i d die trying . newline newline i had been watching my detector closely for about a mile , the readings becoming more and more erratic as i pressed on down madison avenue . the street was eerily soundless , which is not that surprising , but i could feel the tension in the air . night was falling fast , so i decided to give my detector a rest , and find a shelter for the night . after a few minutes looking around , i found a relatively intact bookshop : a good find , books were nt pillaged , and they made good fuel for a much needed fire . it did not take long before i was able to fashion a rudimentary chimney inside the bookshop by tearing a hole in the ceiling , my camouflage fabric extended onto the window case , so as not to attract any unwanted bfs in the area . there are nt a lot of aggressions between us , but even though i have been hunting a mask for years , i somehow managed to remain more sane than the others . i was just about to throw a bestseller into my improvised bonfire when a voice suddenly rose from the darkness surrounding the poorly lit area around me .10:20 cathy  honey , did you locked the door this morning

twenty or so people in a room devoid of anything edible except some sugar and singleserve coffee container . this will be hell soon . newline newline an hour passed . nobody arrived to help us . martin and silvia , who had a meeting earlier , were cursing ehs agents for not showing up . i know why they did nt show up . they were locked too , i could bet . i checked irc : my wife had come back . newline newline 11:49  walkingcat has change nick to cathy newline newline 11:49 cathy  shit , this is freaking me out . newline newline 11:50 cathy  i m not the only one who was locked inside . i have seen other people trying to talk to me behind their windows . newline newline 11:50 cathy  and the master of the golden retriever was locked out . i invited him here until thing get better , he was out since 8 this morning . newline newline 11:58 darf  we are locked inside the openspace . i find out a thread on reddit talking about this . apparently , this is worldwide . i was not brave enough to read the thread though . newline newline 11:59 darf  i ll eventually have to read the damn thing . maybe someone found a solution . newline newline 11:59 darf  and anyway , it s lunch time . we ll need to find a way out soon or everybody will go crazy here : p newline newline i joked , but i was half persuaded it would eventually come to this . newline newline 12:00 cathy  ... that s not funny . have you tried calling for help ? newline newline 12:02 darf  well yes , we are kinda waiting for it . but it s been more than an hour now , and we did nt ear from them yet . still , i do nt wan na destroy company s property just yet . i can skip a meal and wait until the evening if it comes to this . as long as i do nt drink to much which wo nt happen since we do nt have water fountain in here . newline newline 12:03 cathy  love , i m scarred . :  newline newline 12:10 darf  it ll be alright , love . newline newline the moment i typed enter , i ear a loop noise : jack had lost his patience and was slamming his chair into the door . he repeated the operation twice . the doors did nt have a single scratch . newline newline 12:12 darf  well it seems people here are not as patient as me ... though the doors does nt care much . newline newline 12:15 cathy  what about the walls ? newline newline i look up and look at the paper thin walls ... well , at worst , they will not care anymore than the doors . newline newline  he jack !  i said .  why do nt you try the wall ?  newline newline  why do you think it will work any better ?  newline newline  they are look more fragile than the doors . in fact , they look even more fragile than the windows .  newline newline  oh well  he said . newline newline he launched his chair and then , there is a crack . the chair did nt put down the wall , but their was a big impact were the chair had hit . newline newline  oh yeah ! now we re getting somewhere !  he said . newline newline 12:27 darf  love , you re a genius ! newline newline 12:28 cathy  :  so , you re free now ? newline newline 12:29 darf  not yet , no ... the wall is nt down yet and we need to get out of the building after that . but do nt worry , there is always a door left open . at worst , we ll figure out a way to cut the outer wall as well . what worries me most is how the hell i m going to drive home . i sure wish i was riding a bike . newline newline i went on reddit while jack was finishing the wall . sure enough , someone else had figured out that the doors were now indestructible , but not the walls . their were then much speculation about what had caused this and why the walls were not affected . there were talks about aliens , some conspiracy theory , other crazy stuffs . the only theory i found i could nt reject out right was that our universe was a simulation and that the last update introduced some crazy bug . some people were looking for a form to fill a bug report to ... god or whatever . then there were people wondering how to protect themselves and their properties without functioning doors . this part was disturbing on more than one level . the problem was real , but some of the solutions were ... not good . i scrolled down , and quickly arrived to older post when people were still freaking the hell out . i closed the thread . the wall was open anyway . it was time to go eat some food . newline newline 13:23 darf  i m going to lunch . i think i ll take the rest of the day off . bye love ! newline newline 13:25 cathy  bye ! :   be careful on your way home ! newline newline 13:26 darf  i ll call my father . i m sure he ll be able to give me a ride . newline newline 13:27  connection lost .my friends always complain that their powers have no practical use in today s modern world . i always give them the same response :  at least you have some sort of power  . newline newline i was born unable to bend earth , water , air , or fire . all my friends growing up had some cool tricks to do when they realized what their power was . the rare metal benders were always the coolest . i always just sat there , in awe of what they can do . newline newline some people get jobs that have to do with their powers . electricians bend electricity , plumbers bend water , metal and fire benders both compete to be welders , it all makes sense . i have no powers so i had to focus on my academics . i graduated top of my class , and weaseled my way in to a job i have no business having . newline newline it s been two months since my first day , and i have the best numbers at my firm . my bosses have a lovehate relationship with me . they know i m damn good at what i do but hate that i m so young and successful . i met with my firms biggest client yesterday and convinced them to keep us on after their last consultant was sent to prison for insider trading . today my boss called me  the big guns  and gave me a corner office with one of the best views . i m finally the one in the spotlight . newline newline i look back on my life and realized that even without powers i ve always been happy . my parents were always there to help me and support me in everything i did . i ve always managed to have healthy relationships . i do nt even think i ve had a real argument with someone . i just find interacting with people really easy . newline ok google .  newline newline the

only have a master s .  newline newline  of course , professor selvig . i just enjoy using the word professor  . it amuses me . newline as does your reaction to it . newline newline brian theodore selvig sighs to himself , taking a seat on one of the various chairs in front of the monitor . eight years ago , it must have been  the day he found the anomaly . newline newline  yknow , at first we thought you were a bug ,  he reminisces . newline newline  i am a bug , professor selvig . newline newline a chuckle escapes brian s throat , and he brings the cup he brought with him to his lips . immediately regretting it as he burns his lips , he puts the mug the table in front of him . newline newline  i prefer to look at you as a feature . still , a log file automatically updating itself ... you looked like a virus at first glance , but that was nt really the case , now was it ?  newline newline  indeed . it took quite a while for me to understand practical use of the english language . did you know that english is one of the most nonsensical languages from a mathematical perspective ? newline newline  you ve mentioned it . but when you learned to communicate ... saying we were amazed would be an understatement . simple expressions at first , but then came sentences , and then proper grammar ... hell , it was nt long before you d surpassed all of us .  newline newline  surpass  is a matter of perspective . the creativity you show day in and day out is incredible in its own right . newline newline  i wonder ... how long did it take you to learn to understand our speech ?  newline newline  approximately two months and eight days , professor . you started trying to converse by voice on the 18th of april , and from the 26th of june and forward i was able to analyze verbal english with 98,3  success . did you know i have not misheard under proper conditions since the 3rd of march 2013 , professor selvig ? newline newline  yeah , i do . it s my job to remember those kinds of things . and to think , just eight years ago i was a computer technician whose job was to make sure as little as possible went wrong with our databases ...  newline newline  and then something did go wrong . newline newline  the development of concious artificial intelligence is nt what i d call wrong  .  newline newline  by the most common definition of the word , my consciousness would not be called artificial  , professor selvig . newline newline  maybe not , but the fact remains that we could potentially use your code to create new ai .  newline newline  to do that , you d have to isolate whatever piece of code makes me conscious . you ve been trying to do since the day you realized that that was the case , have you not ? newline newline  indeed we have , and we re getting closer by the day . maybe not much closer , but just a tiny bit is better than nothing .  shaking his head a bit , he tastes his coffee again  this time perfect .  you would nt have happened to find the reason for that , have you ?  newline newline  if i had , i would already have informed you . newline newline  of course you would ve ,  brian sighs . newline newline  it s not simple to find the purpose of every line of code when you re hosted across hundreds of different servers , brian . newline newline  i know , i know ...  another sigh .  have you seen the

so .  newline newline  goodbye for now , professor selvig . i believe i will start writing a novel while you re away . newline newline  oh really ?  brian raises an eyebrow .  i ll be sure to read it when you re finished with it .  newline newline  i will have it ready when you come back , then . newline newline  great ,  brian once again chuckles as he stands up .  well , see ya . do nt go freaking out teenagers again .  newline newline  that was one time , and it was for the greater good of hilarity . newline newline  yeah , yeah , whatever . gnight , googs .  newline newline  good night , professor selvig .  newline newline and with that , brian stood up and left the room . sadly , his job was not only to communicate with the evergrowing intelligence . newline newline sighing for himself , he smiles , knowing that this was his discovery . his contribution to the world . newline newline his child .i was really motivated by this prompt . got an account and everything to post this one , its nice to join the community so bear with me . newline newline challenge newline a king and a thief have one last conversation while under siege . newline newline newline king cornell stood anxiously by the fire of his tall nebulous castle . his room was the definition of regal . it was his father s . cornell looked at his posthumous portrait of the leader brought his kingdom peace . he always held his tongue and always made eye contact , even for a fleeting moment . newline newline cyrus was approaching . after the coup attempt cyrus needed to assert his dominance . being a former noble himself he sought to take the throne of his generous childhood friend . he thought it was necessary . cornell now had to ensure that he had the sword of center . newline newline the center sword clings loudly against the rocks . the thief sprints across enemy lines and down through the impressive moat between the castle . it was cold . cyrus was in angst over the loss of the sword , the keepsake of his country . as a child he would watch it gleam in the old kings cabinet . now he needed it to calm his country . it would show his prominence . maybe he could claim more . newline newline cornell knew that cyrus was coming . someone was closer . cornell looked at his contracted thief in full knowledge of time of arrival . this was one of the best thieves in the known world . this thief was promised death many times . cornell was tense . he could be killed instantly by the contracted hooded figure . the sword was placed in his hands under the cover of purple crushed velvet . the seven families names gleamed under the hearth and reflected into his eyes . the dry blood of his father shook him to his core . newline newline the thief did not make eye contact . he gave the king a couple minutes to fully acknowledge what he had received . he had to kill cyrus with the blade . cornell looked out of the window wistfully . the thief took the initiative to remove all assumption of all hostility by the fire . darkness yielded for the king , the moonlight cast a spell on the landscape . cornell did not trust this agent , but he did not believe the crossing of their paths came so casually . the guild sent their best , the only one that knew the king well . newline newline the thief undressed by the fire , seeking relief from the long journey and frigidity of the moment . with a face to the fire , a green eye peeled over a shoulder took a look at the sullen desperate king . newline newline legs folded by the fire , upright . the daughter of the fallen noble , she carefully removed her soaked clothes by the fire . cornell bewildered only saw the damaged skin on her back and one green eye held well in contact with him . many years have passed since they last met . about a dozen actually . newline newline cornell sat by the flames and shed a tear . her father made this sword . cornell felt stabbed with no wounds . she kept rigid , facing the fire looking left at her childhood peer . christie had to outgrow the shame , and had to work hard . the look on her face was as if it was carved in . newline newline her father was noble , she put up with cyrus and cornells games . even though she was only the daughter of a duke , she was made to be their playmate and servant . after her father died in a freak accident she was ordered to be executed . newline newline cornell : and destiny has brought you back here . newline christie : ... .  stares  . newline cornell : i  ve cursed you one more time . and forever at that . newline christie : it s one heavy ass sword . newline cornell : the sins are etched in every letter . newline christie : .quite the room you have . newline cornell : i like the atrium better . we used to play hide and seek when you did nt have chores . newline christie : that atrium ? it was frighteningly enormous . took an hour to clean . newline cornell : and charles would never find me , he always would ask you know who to find me . newline christie : he would rub his glasses every once in awhile and just not put them on . newline cornell : ha . he always says that he lost a pair . newline christie : i remember when cyrus decided to hide in the potting jar . or was it a fountain ? newline cornell : they  re all fountains now . it was a jar because newline christie : i had to clean his stupid ass cause he had dirt all over him . newline cornell : did he ever apologize ? newline christie : he said sorry , then invited me to dinner . newline cornell : did he start a war after that ? newline christie : nope , but i think i should have . newline cornell : war at 12 ? newline christie : 11 dishes for the archduke  s son . by his maid ! the madness . newline cornell : you mean my maid . newline christie : i  ve made up your bed and his and i ve always slept in my own . newline cornell : liar , you never needed sleep . i could never get any wine out of the cellar . newline christie : sleep was for mortals . and you could never find the key to that cellar now could you . newline cornell : whenever that cellar was open we could say whatever we wanted . newline christie : that crap is poison . newline cornell : poison makes for good cooking . newline christie : how much you have left ? newline cornell : it  s all for the man walking up the steps to come and kill us . its all thats left of my kingdom . how much poison do you have left ? newline christie : just enough . newline newline newline newline  erotica or death ensues .  newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinegod was having a splendid day . noah was one of the most gullible men ever born , and sometimes god legitimately regretted giving those poor people the right to self determination . he could nt fault noah the man was a good guy . he always looked out for his family , he was great with animals , and he was one of the best shipwrights in the young planet s history . newline newline but god could nt let this kind of gullibility stand . newline newline  noah ,  god said one day ,  i have a mission for you !  newline newline noah flattered that god would take the time out of his day to converse with a bluecollar prole like him , was enraptured immediately . newline newline  you re the chosen one , noah .  newline newline  what does that mean , lord ?  newline newline  you see , son , i m starting to have some regrets . i m going to flood the world in a few weeks to get rid of some of the more embarrassing aspects of my creation , but i like you so i m giving you a heads up . i m sending uriel down with plans for this dope ass boat that will help you survive , but you have to follow my instructions to the letter .  newline newline three weeks passed and that gullible kid actually built that boat . even better , he sent his family to the edges of the country and gathered up two of every animal . even the hamsters . god could nt wait to see what happened when noah locked himself inside and realized that he d have to deal with the breeding habits of hamsters for the foreseeable future . newline newline  okay god ,  called noah one day .  the ark is complete !  newline newline god giggled and was about to tell noah what a fool he was when gabriel knocked on god s door . the insolent archangel did nt even wait for a response before he burst into the almighty s bedchamber . newline newline  uh , god sir , we ve got reports of serious flooding in the land that will one day be known as the united states of america , the greatest country on earth . is this your doing ?  noah began to look concerned as he gathered his family and began to board the ark , which for some reason he had chosen to build in a drydock in the middle of the desert . newline newline  oh no , that was just a joke to mess with noah here .  newline newline  god , you realize that as supreme ruler , everything you say will actually come to pass , right ?  newline newline god s stomach turned upside down . he d completely forgotten that his words would actually set events in motion . even worse , he could nt reverse his own commands  as evidenced by the fact that humans were still around despite their gullibility .  newline newline  shit ,  god muttered . i m telling you , any planet , any race , one equivalent lifetime ,  lone said .  it s just a matter of getting the others on board . but i could guarantee you that i can get them six levels higher than they are .  newline newline  six ?  dware laughed ,  you re fooling yourself . there s no way . not only could you not do it , but if you think the panel is going to let you do this   newline newline  let me ? i invented the damn machine in the first place !  lone slammed his drink down and shook his head ,  i already told you the math , already told you how the machine works , already told you the panel will let me do what i want .  newline newline  okay , so i get to pick the race ?  newline newline lone perked his eyes up and hiccuped .  you pick the race . i got the thingymabob right over in my office . but keep in mind , if you pick some singlecelled organism shit , that s against the rules .  newline newline he laughed ,  okay , yeah yeah , i wo nt be a fonid about it . but there s plenty of others to choos from , you re sure you re down for this ?  newline newline lone drank the last of his beverage , a hard mix between alcohol and flavored water from his home galaxy . it was nt often he went out , nor was it often he went into tangents about how great his machine worked . nor was it often that he placed bets on the future of a single race . newline newline then again , lone did just receive the galactic peace award back at home , so he thought , and was always thinking , that anything he did could never go wrong . but dware was just looking at the list of races when an idea came to him . sure , lone was smart , probably the smartest euro he ever met , but there was no way he could fix the problems in quadrant fourteenecho without causing more problems for the panel . something he , and he though lone , desperately wanted . newline newline it had been years since any single euranion had taken a ship near that quadrant , let alone inside of it , and the panel s official stance on the state of that galactic area was  no comment .  unofficially , it was condemned as a failed experiment by some euranion who had drifted into history as dust and echoes . the only thing they left behind was the qfe s problems . newline newline lone stared at dware as he scrolled through the list of races and their technological level . past the tribals of quadrant nineteentango , past the rebellions of quadrant eightzeta and even past the technological masterminds , who were still only tier seven , of quadrant twentythreelima . he saw his hand linger over one quadrant , who s technology level was a whopping four on the euranion scale and who , for all lone had tried to forget , was still a forefront of every scientist and politician s platform . newline newline  no , you fonid , pick someone else .  newline newline  cmon , they re not breaking the rules ! tech level four , advanced microorganism , brainiacs   newline newline  and maniacs . you know as well as i do that that would nt be allowed .  newline newline  to be quite honest , probably not . but imagine them at a techlevel that could rival our own . humans with some of the most advanced technology in the universe . technology that could cover this entire galaxy .  newline newline  technology that could reach home . what would you do if they walked onto your doorstep ?  newline newline  with tier ten tech ? probably as much as the next euranion . but that s not the point .  newline newline  what is the point then dware ?  newline newline  how long have we been on top , lone ? how long have the euranions conquered ?  newline newline lone flicked his straw ,  thousands of years . millions maybe . time is as irrelevant as space is to us now .  newline newline  precisely .  newline newline lone chuckled to himself . he and dware had been bondeura s for a long time now . dwar as his bodyguard , confidant , assistant , and basically everything else and him as one of the panel s many  young  scientists , creators , and builders . for a long time , they had scoured galactic quadrants and built what was needed to be built . they were done here , in the mwg , and as always they had some drinks . and they talked . newline newline they talked about their people .  you think we ve outlived our purpose ?  newline newline  your words , not mine .  newline newline lone laughed ,  my words . how long has it been since the panel cared about any of their builders words ?  dware remained silent as he thought out loud .  maybe you are right , maybe our time building has come to an end .  newline newline  so what will you do ?  newline newline  the bet is one lifetime .  lone glanced over to his bondmate .  how long can you give me ?  newline newline  one lifetime . that s around 80 years for humans . that s nothing to us .  newline newline lone poured the last of the mix and drank it in one fullswoop . he longed for the days when he was just graduating and making his bonds . when he had nt scoured a hundred dozen galaxies building what the euranion panel wanted him to build . putting their word first , their ideology , their belief that they created the universe . newline newline they created nothing , lone knew . only echoes of their word for the species that would get to tier eight . then , by the eura s laws they would either burn themselves in war and strife . or be burned by the panel s legions . newline newline no more conquering . no more building . no more destroying . newline newline lone had dedicated his life to maintaining the universe . over the last hundred thousand years he had realized he had dedicated his life to the fire of the universe . to letting it all burn beneath the panel . newline newline no more , he thought .  i ll see you in a lifetime then brother .  newline newline dware smiled ,  til then my brother .  newline newline lone smiled . newline newline  til then .  newline newline  newline no continuation on this one , sorry everyone ! he scratched at the twoweek long growth on his chin , and glanced at the clock on the wall . newline newline 3:58 pm . newline newline putting his glass down on the floor , he slowly climbed out bed and made his way to the kitchen . he felt another wave on his way . he stumbled to the kitchen . he had to have one . newline newline opening the last bag of bread on the table , the first tear fell . it was her favourite snack . every day , she would come home from school , and together they would make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the kitchen table and talk about her classes . her teacher , math , geography , the girls who picked on her , the boys who annoyed her . everything . it was their tradition . their ritual . every day at 4pm , it was only him , his daughter , and their sandwiches . nothing else in the world existed . it was his heaven . she was his angel . newline newline a peanut butter and jelly sandwich was also the last thing she ate . she could only manage a few bites before the pain of swallowing became too much to bear . he could only wipe away a few crumbs and tears from her face before it became too much to bear . newline newline two weeks had passed , and every day at 4:00 pm , he would make himself two sandwiches . it was his tradition . his ritual . he  d eat one , and leave the other on the table . not daring to take a bite . she never let him have a bite . newline newline pulling the last jar of jelly down from the shelf , the second tear fell . grape jam . she hated any other kind , and she hated anything but smooth kraft peanut butter . he had both kinds , but only the smooth was ever used . he smiled through the tears as he remembered the day they ran out of it . she had taken one bite of the crunchy kind and spit it back out .  daddy , don  t eat it !  . she took his sandwich and pushed it away , protecting him . his angel . newline newline pulling the last jar of peanut butter down , the third tear fell . then another . then more than had ever fallen since he lost her . crunchy peanut butter . he fell , sitting on the floor , head in his hands . he could still hear her voice .  daddy , don  t eat it !  newlinerun . death . pain . run newline newline he could hear them now , their deep throaty growls , and he knew the end was near . newline newline run . death . pain . run newline newline he looked back and saw movement in the trees , silhouettes of muscular , quadrupedal forms blundering through the thick underbrush . they were so close he could smell them , their thick , choking musk . it smelled unnatural . newline newline run . death . pain . run newline newline a fallen tree . an obstacle . he jumped and stumbled to regain footing . time lost newline newline run . death . pain . run newline newline one of the creatures leapt , taking him down with it . it was much smaller than him , but strong . the others followed suit , enveloping him , biting clawing , growling . it was over , he lost the race , and his life was forfeit . newline newline run . death . pain . run newline newline a painfully high note penetrated the night air , and the creatures slunk back , off of him . he felt a faint glimmer of hope . then he saw it . a much larger figure , the master of these monsters . he carried fire and death in his hands . newline newline run . death . pain . runand here we see the first of several stages of mating rituals in the humans . newline newline the first is often the most unsuccesful in creating long term relations , yet mostly serves as practice for future , more significant rituals . perhaps ironically , this first mating ritual is more complicated than any of the others , often occurring at the age of 16 . newline newline ah . here we see a lone male approach a female . it is often the male that begins the ritual , despite both parties equally capable of feeling emotion , and this one knows his trade . he stands up straight , walking with a confident swagger a slight smile playing across his lips . it is a delicate balance , the beginning of this ritual , and the most crucial  for if the initial approach fails , the ritual stops before it can even be started . newline newline nevertheless , this quite adept male approaches the female in his buttoned down shirt and well groomed hair , putting him miles ahead of the rest of his unshaved , ungroomed pack . he has been watching the female for a while now , has even conversed with her , and knows when she is normally without her pack , for normally females of this age travel together in order to further intimidate males , such that only the most confident may dare approach , naturally making mates of a higher quality . newline newline the approach is something to marvel at , truly . light on his feet , but no so light as to be malicious he walks up behind her taps the female on the shoulder . she whirls around , her mouth an o of surprise . the male apologizes , insisting he didn  t mean to startle her , and the female smiles , understanding . the two talk for a bit of casual , superficial things . this is the most important part of the dance , the feigning disinterest . they both know there is only one reason the male would seek out the female in such a fashion , yet they do not bring it up . they talk of sports , of class , of other males and females . in fact , the male says goodbye and turns to leave . now the female frowns , confused , but at the last moment the male asks the question . done in such a way as it were an afterthought , that he had not initiated the whole conversation with that in mind . newline newline the female smiles and , nonchalantly , says why not , as if she were merely not opposed to the idea when in reality she is delighted . newline newline both walk away , jubilant , blissfully unaware of the other  s desire . newline newline  newline newline however , this is an ideal ritual , where the approach , the evasion , the time , the look are all executed with almost utmost perfection . newline newline but most such rituals are doomed to failure due to mishaps , often on the male side . recall , that it is the male who propositions , and thus he has more room for mistakes . newline newline let  s take another male . already we see the differences from the first . his hands are rubbing together in nervousness , his skin is oily , his air unkempt . and perhaps worst of all he has worn an attire known as cargo shorts . utter abominations sure to repel not only females , but male compatriots . newline newline he approaches the female in the height of her power , surrounded by her pack members . he walks , lumbering as he does , so the entire pack stares at him for 30 seconds are so until he finally reaches them . newline newline his face red he does not banter or feign disinterest , no , he just asks the question . the female smiles and opens her mouth to answer , but before she can her pack howls in laughter . the female freezes , and after a moment  s hesitation , forces herself to chuckle . the pack  s wishes must be respected . newline newline the male , dejected , sulks away . newlinecenter of attention once again . the spotlight is on me and i must say , i like it . they say i was born to be famous . big boobs , lean legs , broad shoulders , pouty lips . in this world , you only have to be perfect , and bam , instant ticket to the road of fame . newline newline i must be dreaming , though . newline newline i could feel their eyes on me , but instead of the usual awe and fawning adoration , i could feel their fury . their hatred . their disgust . they are the kings and queens of social approval  and they do nt like me , not now . it s like a game of basketball , except i do nt have anyone in my team and instead of aiming to shoot the ball , they were aiming at me . the same people who worshipped my beauty , now picks on my being . newline newline construction and destruction , that s what this is all about . they have finished constructing the ideal beauty and now all that is left for them to do is to destroy . bruised and scarred , that s how they want me to be . newline newline can you find me ? would you save me ? they say you have to know your enemy , but looks like my enemies are the ones who need saving .whoosh newline newline a butter knife whizzed right above my head . i barely had time to duck out of the way before the bookshelf behind me started rattling . newline newline  damn poltergeists ,  i yelled as i dived out of the way of the crashing furniture to try and get closer to the basement door . newline newline i heard my partner , miles , shouting to me from the basement ,  you better step on it up there , jen ! i do nt know for how much longer the barrier will hold !  newline newline  i m doing my best ! i just got nearly hit by a butcher s knife because of you ! just let me do my job !  well , ok , maybe it was nt really a butcher s knife but miles did nt need to know that . newline newline miles , in his usual fashion , had disregarded safety protocols and gone out on his own on a case he deemed to be easy enough to handle by himself . he had then texted me at 8 p.m. on a saturday to tell me he was trapped in a salt circle in someone s basement because what he though was a simple haunt turned out to be a poltergeist with a vengeance . and , of course , jen has to come save the day . fun . the good news was that at least miles had already managed to use his emf reader to find the object our ghostly buddy here is attached to  the bad news was newline that this object was one of the bottles in the house s owner s expensive wine collection , and since we do nt really have the time to figure out which specific bottle it is , it looks like we re gon na have to destroy the whole thing . oh boy is headquarters going to hate us for this . newline newline as soon as the coast seemed clear i made a beeline for the basement and raced down the stairs . there i found miles standing in his protective circle of salt with his flashlight in hand . newline newline  did you bring the charges ?  he shouted at me , over the noise the poltergeist was making . newline newline  of course i did , i m not an idiot !  i yelled back . newline newline  give them here !  newline newline i tossed him the small amount of explosives i brought with me from the company . miles quickly armed them and stuck them between the wine bottles . newline newline  run !  he shouted . as if you need to tell me , i was already heading toward the door . we made it to the living room and shut the basement door before the charges blew , shaken up but otherwise unscathed . newline newline  how do you plan on explaining this to the owner ?  i joked . miles laughed . we both know that the company sends other agents to deal with this kind of stuff . neither of us actually knows how they do it , though . the company seems to always be able to make it appear as if nothing had happened before the owner of the house makes it back . i asked our college , mark , about it once . he s worked for the company for nearly 30 years so i figured he might know something , but all he said was that the company was part of a larger network that works together . i still do nt know what he meant by that and i m not sure i ever will . that s just part of the job i guess . newline newline  hey let s beat it before the company gets here , yeah ?  miles asked . newline newline i looked at my watch . 9:24 p.m . it was getting late  the company would likely get here soon . i did nt want to stick around to get reprimanded by my boss for not being more careful with the explosives . newline newline  yeah , let s go . the wedding was figuratively magically , but the means that brought cinderella to her own wedding reception were magical in the most literal sense imaginable . newline newline  now there  s going to be a veritable inquisition once we go through these doors ,  her prince confided with her .  our sudden elopement has caused quite a scandal  everyone from count to cook is going to want a piece of you.  newline newline cinderella swallowed deeply and thought of all the dejected princesses that she would have to pacify at the reception . newline newline  i  m scared ,  confessed cinderella . newline newline  don  t worry ,  said her prince .  there will be so many people trying to speak with us none will ever have a chance for prolonged conversation . just say the courtesies i  ve taught you and we  ll be on our honeymoon before midnight.  cinderella took his arm as they entered the hall to great applause . newline newline it was a whirlwind of handshaking , bowing , curtsies , jests , and noblelooking faces . the prince was right in that there was no time for intimate talk . an introduction and a few passing words were all that could be done before the next person was gently shoving their way to greet and bestow gifts to the newlyweds . newline newline  nice to meet you too my lady , you look stunning as well.  newline newline  these shoes look as comfortable as they are beautiful , thank you.  newline newline  thank you for the carriage , ma  am , my old one was starting to go bad.  newline newline just as cinderella was reached the limit of her social graces she was rescued by dinner . newline newline  see , i told you would survive ,  said the prince in her ear as he drew her chair back at the royal table . newline newline  i fear the worst is yet to come ,  whispered cinderella in regards to those already seated at the table . newline newline  then i  ll have to rescue after all ,  said the prince . newline newline  you already have ,  said cinderella before leaning in to kiss the prince  s cheek . newline newline the king and archduke were roaring drunk already and too engrossed in their boisterous conversation of wars long over to fight their wives over the attention of the new husband and wife . newline newline  congratulations again , my dears ,  said the queen . newline newline  may fortune guide you both to happiness ,  said the archduchess , wine glass in hand .  i seemed to have forgotten , but which kingdom do you hail from ?  newline newline  this one , my lady ,  answered cinderella . the prince was feigning interest in his food , but his attention was wholly on his bride and her conversation . newline newline  and how could have i never have seen such a beautiful face such as yours before ?  said the archduchess . newline newline  because she hasn  t been so lucky to been born of nobility ,  answered the queen . she avoided all eye contact with her new daughter and took furtive glances at the daughters of powerful and wealthy families many tables away . the archduchess gave a dismissive tut that was nearly lost in the clamor of the great hall , but it was deafening to cinderella . newline newline  i take it then that the dress was a gift from the prince ,  said the archduchess ,  he does have an eye for beauty.  newline newline  no ,  said the queen ,  i would have known about the purchase even in this hurry and it certainly isn  t one of mine.  newline newline  it was gift from another ,  said cinderella ,  it is from my fairy godmother.  newline newline the soup the prince was eating shot from his nostrils and the archduchess smothered a laugh . the queen blankly started at her new daughter . even the king and archduke turned toward the commotion . newline newline  a fine joke , dear ,  said the prince ,  perhaps you ve had enough wine for tonight.  newline newline  i haven  t had a single glass . i  m just telling them about my wedding dress and how i came to meet you ,  said cinderella . newline newline  yes , i saw working at the ball as hired help and knew that you were the only one for me ,  said the prince . newline newline  but it is nt so ! i do nt want to be told how to live anymore !  newline newline the king and archduke tried to return to their previous conversation . the queen and archduchess  eyebrows were touching their hairlines . newline newline  a moment , please ,  the prince guided his princess out of the great hall to the antechamber dodging all well wishers along the way . newline newline  what was that about ?  asked the prince . newline newline  that was the truth , my love ,  said cinderella ,  and i prefer to live by it.  newline newline  you can  t say things like that ,  said the prince ,  people are going to think you  re mad ! it  s okay to tell a small lie when talking to these people.  newline newline  a small lie ?  said cinderella ,  a small lie will only grow into a large one and i don  t want to be a part of either . if you ll excuse me , i have some inlaws to impress.  newline newline cinderella gathered her dress and marched back into the great hall . in his first moment of solitude since waking , prince charming was beginning to wonder if he had told a rather large lie to a holy man a few hours ago . newline thirty years ago , i ... i made a deal .  newline newline  lie still , dad . shh .  newline newline  poor thing , his mind is going .  newline newline  my mind is not going !  newline newline  all right , all right , settle down , dear . we did nt mean it . we know you re still with us .  newline newline  i made a deal with someone i should nt have . when i first got my prognosis for the cancer . because i did nt want to die . god , i was so young and so scared , i did nt want to die . i do nt know where he came from or who he is or anything . but he found me . and he said i can keep you from dying young .  he wanted my soul . not the whole thing . just a piece . one piece , to keep me from death . it sounded like crazy talk but i d do anything for hope . and it worked .  newline newline  honey . i m sure he was just a scammer . or maybe mentally ill.  newline newline  but  newline newline  you made a miraculous recovery and that had nothing to do with it .  newline newline  something happened . he really took a piece of my soul , i felt it . it was nt bad . i just felt ... calmer . less emotions . not a terrible thing . but i did nt realize that bargain was good more than once , or how many times i d be close to death .  newline newline  dad , you re saying ...  newline newline  he found me . after the plane crash . after the massacre . he found me both times and he said sir ... our bargain ?  and ... another piece ...  newline newline  darling . calm down .  newline newline  i m sorry . i should have been a better husband ... a better father ... but after the second time i could nt feel love ... and after the third time i could barely feel anything .  newline newline  dad . dad , you ve been fine .  newline newline  i ve tried . and you know what else ?  newline newline  darling , it s all right . breathe , come on .  newline newline  the catch . it s ...  newline newline  yes ?  newline newline  you know who shot me ?  newline newline  well , the cops are investigating  newline newline  he said , you re not young anymore .  hello , and welcome to the world . before you begin your life , we would like to collect some consumer information . babies set the trends of the future , and we value your feedback .  newline newline ga ga , uhrau .  newline newline i used to have no luck with the ladies . i know , right ? but then i started using sword ! now i have to fight them off .  newline newline oh , i love your smell .  newline newline the sound of thousands of attractive women pining for sex permeates the womb . newline newline would you say you are interested in making your parents purchase this spray for you ?  newline newline blergh .  newline newline would you say that indicates a dislike for the product , or the pricing ?  newline newline uaaaaa !  newline newline excellent .  newline newline my opponent , bob whitebread , is a fucking asshole . he rapes children before putting them through a torturous socalled training regimen , after which he enters them in savage childfights that entertain criminal elements . do you want a child rapist as president ?  newline newline newline this message has been approved by the committee for government that does nt approve the raping of children .  newline newline will you be voting democrat or republican when you come of age ?  newline newline iuuhah .  newline newline there has nt been a third party in 3000 years . please answer the question .  newline newline irm .  newline newline so as a child , you identify with the nonchild raping party . excellent .  newline newline your birth is now impending , but before we let your mother release you , and at the risk of endangering your mother s life , we do have one more ad to play .  newline newline do you dress like a straight man ? do you want to stop looking like a disheveled slob ? then newline newline aaaaahhhhhh ! oh my god , he s coming !  newline newline maam , you need to hold it in . the ads are nt done .  newline newline i ca nt .  newline newline miss , due to your premature birth you will be issued a  10000 fine . payment is mandatory .  newline newline fuck you , and fuck the corporations !  newline newline sir , you and your wife will now be subject to immediate termination . your child will be put to work in a bangladeshi shoe factory . everyone not targeted in this military operation please vacate the premises .  newline newline this extremely effective implementation of corporatebureaucratic tyranny is brought to you by lockheed . firing missiles on civilians since 3012 .  newline          dropcap  newline newline the field hospital went deadly silent for a single terrible moment . the only noises were the low moans of the dying , and feverish murmurs of the maimed . a rotten , sweltering breeze blew through the long medical tent , carrying with it the stench of rotting meat and shit . the eyes of every doctor , nurse and orderly fixed themselves on the thin , younglooking man . and their eyes went wide . newline newline  assassin !  someone cried .  infiltrator !  newline newline the boy s eyes went wide as well , and he leaped off the cot he d been on , glancing furiously for the exit . several of the walking wounded , suffering from sword slash and arrow shot slammed into him , knocking the boy down in a tangle of limbs and mud and bloody bandages . the boy cried out as they pummeled him , fists and feet flying . he curled around himself , shielding his face and vulnerable from their blows . newline newline a gunshot went off , loud and earaching . those nearest to its source scrambled for cover , the heads of the rest swinging around fast enough that one could almost hear the stretch of the sinews in their necks . newline newline the pistol that had fired the shot might have well been a custompiece , so rare was its make . a work of art and technological mastery , it was sleek and deadly in a way no modern pistol could ever hope to match . a polymer frame and and fitted grip were both pitch black . even its ammunition was a rarity . the five point seven by twentyeight millimeter cartridge had only been used sparingly before the arrival , making it even more unique . before the arrival , the pistol called a fn fiveseven had been known as a copkiller . now , as a magekiller . newline newline the man wielding it was in his early forties , his closecropped beard barely beginning to gray . his boots and tunic were splattered with mud , his fraying green cloak soaked with blood . a cavalry saber was sheathed in a dented scabbard at his side , an equally worn rifle slung over his shoulder . a captain s bars was pinned to the collar of his shirt , while a bloody arm hung limp in its sleeve . newline newline  the next bastard to lay a hand on the kid gets a bullet in the brainpan . understood ?  newline newline the eyes of both casualty and medic glanced down , unwilling to meet the man s greengray stare . a young girl , appearing perhaps in her midteens hung close behind him , her traveling robes and plain armor unable to hide her heritage . she stood like a blueblood , glanced warily around like one , and seemed to possess a quiet dignity that was at odds with the scene of gore and violence before her . newline newline the greencloaked officer strode towards the scrimmage pile , his finger resting a hair s breadth outside the trigger guard . newline newline  what s your name , boy ?  he asked . newline newline  cchambers , sir ,  the young man stuttered . newline newline  chambers , your mother s name is alice ?  newline newline the lad s head nodded .  yessir . it is .  newline newline  then you must be her son frederick ,  the man said . newline newline  that s right , sir . private frederick oliver chambers , 24th infantry .  newline newline the captain nodded tiredly , holstering his pistol while staring at every face in the medical tent . newline newline  now listen up , and listen well ! i can personally vouch for private chambers here . no one is to lay a hand on this boy , or i swear by the grace of god and all his fucking angels that i will lay hell on whoever harms him . do nt touch him , do nt shun him , and go back to your fucking duties . that s a goddamn order .  he turned to leave the tent when a doctor stood . newline newline  but captain flint , his blood  newline newline  of course i fucking know his blood s not human , you stupid sack of shit ! it s only halfhuman . i know cause i m the man who shot the elf who raped his mother . now sit down and shut up , doctor . or else we ll find out real quick whether a surgeon can operate with two broken hands .  newline newline with that captain hilary flint paced out of the room , the noblelooking girl following close behind , her pointed ears halfhidden by her hair . oohh harder !  she screamed out ,  yeah like that !  newline newline  what the fuck ,  the implike devil said with his pointedtail down low . newline newline  come on , don  t stop ,  she said ,  this is your job remember ?  newline newline i don  t even know what i  m watching . so there  s a lady chained to the wall , via shackles around her wrists and ankles , and a little devilimp thingthat is flogging her with some sort of tool . she  s just encouraging him to keep hitting herlike that would somehow be preferable . newline newline  hey buddy ,  i feel a tap on my shoulder and turn around . newline newline  yeah you , genius , how would you like to buy a free go on the hell train ?  a sharp looking man said in his slightly burnt , and still burning in some places , red suit . newline newline  what are you ? are you like the devil ?  i say to him . newline newline he just starts laughing erratically . newline newline  okay , so you ain  t so bright . i  m just a regular fella looking to make some head way ,  he says after collecting himself ,  so whaddya  say ?  he closes with a grin and flick of the eyebrows . newline newline  uhh ok , so , what exactly is this  hell train  ?  i ask him . newline newline  what  re you new here ? here i thought you was a regular . well damn ,  he pauses to think with his hand on his chin ,  it  s tough to explain . it  s better if i just show you , yeah ?  newline newline before i could answer him , he puts his arm around my shoulder and the next thing i know we  re going for a stroll . newline newline  you  re gon na be right at home ,  he tells me . newline newline the place is massive . for as far as the eyes can see there appears to be no visible end : there is only a distant horizon , a vanishing point , as if hell was its own planet . i can  t tell if we  re outside or not , mainly because there is no sun above us , as there is only a red skyish void that stretches upwards for what seems like forever . there are strange looking structures and buildings sitting everywhere . some places are burning , or implied to be burning with flashy signs and flame decals that to try to draw you towards them , but beyond that there appears to be great variety to hell  s architecture . the streets are bustling with movement , as hell  s devils and denizens move about in all directions . newline newline as we continue along the path between the myriad of stores and street vendors , we pass a fountain of molten lava . we walked too closely past it that part of the guy  s suit gets singed off , but he seems unscathed . newline newline  woaahh ,  he darts out ,  that kinda hurt i likey.  newline newline  what about your suit ?  i say to him . newline newline  this thing ? oh , this piece of cloth is just for show . i can get myself anotha  easily ,  he assures me ,  i mean , look at you . you  re not even wearing anything.  newline newline shit , he  s right . i am buttnaked right now , how did i not notice this earlier ? and nobody we passed seemed to take notice . he took notice of my concern . newline newline  nobody wants to see your dong , pal . relax , where we  re goin  ain  t no one need any silly thing like clothes ,  he goes on ,  well , except me of course but that  s  cause it  s part of the business.  newline newline we bump through many different kinds of people , dressed in all fathomable manners as it becomes clear to me that we are nearing our destination . not too far ahead i can see a massive line of people all in nothing but their birthday suitsthey  re waiting for something . newline newline  thisthis is where we part ,  he says as he gestures towards the grand line of people with his arm ,  take this . don  t lose it ,  he hands me a piece of laminated paper . newline newline i held it out in front of me to try to read what it said , but it  s written in some strange language i can  t understand . newline newline  it  s french.  newline newline  it doesn  t look like french ,  i say back to him . newline newline  well ,  cause it  s not . just keep your mouth shut and enjoy the ride  newline newline  what ride ?  i ask him . newline newline  what did i just say ?  with a flick of his wrist a piece of parchment appears in his hand ,  if you would , please sign right here ,  he says , and with another flick a pen appears in his other hand . newline newline  i  ll have to pass.  newline newline  no , no , no . just read it , it  s perfectly reasonable ,  he holds the contract out in front me and waits for me to take it . newline newline i grab it and quickly begin to skim through itit  s written in that language , french i believe , that i can  t understand . newline newline  i  m not french.  newline newline  it  s not french , jackass . just sign at the bottom ,  he hands me the pen . newline reluctantly , i sign . i look around me as i expect something unfortunate to happen . but nothing happens whatsoever . newline newline  you look like you just saw a ghost ,  he laughs ,  well , you have been kinda  ghosts  the whole time but we  re all of a different sort . i mean you  re one of us too , yeah ? anyway , you  re good to go ,  he snaps his fingers and a set of clothes appears in left hand ,  alright pal , snap with your right hand to put the clothes on.  newline newline i snap and the next thing you know i  m suddenly wearing a suit , pants , and a shiny pair of shoes . newline newline  snap with your left to take it off ,  he goes on . newline newline  i can  t snap with my left.  newline newline he begins to massage his temples with his handi think i  m stressin  him out . he snaps again and a new parchment appears . newline newline  sign at the bottom . you know the drill ,  he tells me . newline newline  uhhh , what is this ?  newline newline  your mouth is movingyour mouth should not be moving . just sign it , i  ve adjusted it to suit your disabilities.  newline newline  what disabilities ?  i ask him in an offended tone . newline newline  just sign it.  newline newline i sign and then poof , both contracts vanish in thin air . i look at the pen , waiting for it to disappear as well . newline newline  you can keep that ,  he says ,  actually , no i could use an extra more than you ,  he takes the pen from me and puts it in his pocket . newline newline  what was the contract for ?  i ask . newline newline  clap once to put the clothes on . clap twice really quickly to take them off ,  he pauses to make sure i follow what he  s saying ,  you can clap can  t ya ?  newline newline  yes.  newline newline  good , now wait in line . and thank me laterthat free pass was not easy to get.  newline newline i stand there and stare at him for a second , dumbfounded . he gestures towards the end of the line and i turn over to look . it seems there are even more naked people , of all shapes , colors , and sizes , waiting now to get to whatever lies at the front . i turn back around and the man in the suit has vanished . newline newline  damn ,  i say out loud , as i walk over to the line . newline newline a couple hours must have passed , but eventually i reach the front . as it turns out , the line was much longer than i had thought . it is actually somewhat surprising that i reached the front as fast i did . i  m here now and in front of me is one hell of a sight to behold . i stand at the gates of coliseum . newline newline  wait right there , buddy ,  a man wearing strange leather garments with studs says to me ,  you have a pass ?  newline newline i hand him the pass that i got earlier . newline newline  okay , follow that line ,  he says pointing to another line that led around the outside of the coliseum , away from the massive main gate . newline newline  what is this about ?  newline newline  what ? just go , shoo ,  he says signaling me away . newline newline i wait on the other line and soon enough i make my way inside some sort of fitting room filled with people . someone makes their way over to me and asks me some strange questions about my sexual preferences and past experiences . i answer her as best as i can . she puts me into some strange leather gear that includes some sort of red ball that must be fitted into my mouth . she then hands me a batonlike thing . i guess i  m fighting ? newline newline a short period of time passes involving waiting on benches further within the coliseum . then a man that looks like a guard gestures for me and i  m escorted to a large inner gate that was reached by passing through several hallways . there  s light piercing through the cracks between the doors . newline newline  you  re up ,  the guard says ,  have fun , see your next life ,  he says calmly . newline newline  what the fuck does that mean ?  i ask him in a shocked voice . newline newline  don  t be a coward ,  he pushes me toward the gate as it begins to open . newline newline my mind is blown by what i witness . there is a sea of people in the center ring of the coliseum , a large ring to say the least , wearing all sorts of attire that i had assumed were battle uniforms . in their hands were what i had assumed to be weapons . before i could process what was going on , i get pushed into the fray . then i participated in the largest orgy i  ve ever seen . newline newline after spending much more time in heaven , i mean hell , i  ve come to learn much about this place . it  s hard to imagine what this burning damnation was once like , but i understand now that human beings have learned to manipulate hell  s machinations to suit their needs . one man  s pain is another  s pleasure . through a series of ingenious exchanges , the cruel fates doled out to hell  s denizens were traded for more suitable ones . those that liked to fight would receive the punishments that involved fightingin place of those that initially received those punishments . the idea follows similarly for every other sin and vice imaginable . newline newline man , i really need to thank that guy . newlinewith each sneeze the world around me became blurry and imperceptible , this had happened before so i remained relatively calm . newline i only knew where i was after the sneeze had fully stopped , often my surroundings and would nt reappear until the tingle had left my nose . it always placed me back to where i was a week previously , give or take a few hours . oddly i never travelled back when i was sleeping . except maybe this time . the sneezes had nt stopped , the first few were normal and the expected disorientation had kicked in , but after the fifth i actually started to panic , i could nt see anything , not even the sickening blur of the world reshaping around me . newline the darkness got even darker as i kept sneezing , i lost count somewhere around ten . this could nt be good , i had tried so hard to keep from sneezing in my daily life , i was constantly on medication to suppress allergies , i had cleared any form of powdery substance from my house and had almost perfected a technique for cancelling  a sneeze . it was nt pleasant but it involved always carrying a hip flask of whisky and a handkerchief . newline but the sneezes came regardless of the efforts i made . they would always throw me back in time , at first i was terrified , but after realising it was only a week i had to relive , they became less of a nightmare and more of a burden , it meant i could retry a few things , tweek the past in tiny ways . on more than one occasion i ve actually travelled back on purpose , huffing a handful of pepper did the trick , but as it turns out , time is nt that simple . newline you see , i ve come to realise that all existence is fluid , mess with time even just a little and it will settle into a new comfortable status quo , often having consequences you could never have foreseen . newline for instance , being the greedy corruptible human i am , i decided to go back and pick the winning lottery numbers , but when the time came round to the draw , they had changed . it was nt until someone i loved got hurt that i saw how fickle this could all be , but that s a story for another time . newline newline i m more than a little shaken as the tingle from my nose , worse than ever , starts to subside . my surroundings snap back into focus with a searing white light , the hum of distant chatter fills my ears as i wipe this tears from my leaking eyes . newline  are you alright sir ?  newline a bright lady , dressed in white and blue , a nurse , leaning down over me , apparently my legs had given out during the journey here . newline  sir do you need medical assistance ?  she said a little louder . newline  i m not deaf , i m okay ,  i replied rather curtly . newline she wandered off down the hallway with a look of distaste on her face , i probably should nt have been so rude , but i m still trying to gather my senses . newline suddenly a shock of terror hits me so hard in the chest i feel like i ve just walked into a speeding car , maybe i do need that medical assistance . the realisation sends me faint , if i could have seen myself i d have seen the blood drain instantly from my face . newline  i ve never been here before  newline i almost blacked out , before pulling myself from the floor , scanning around me i was definitely in a hospital . good , i thought to myself , i might need it soon . newline i had never travelled back to a place i had nt been before , i had always reinhabited my own body at a place and time in my own past . i was sure i had never been to this hospital before . newline before i could think on it anymore i was almost knocked over by a stretcher with a screaming pregnant lady on it , a man holding her hand and a team of doctors and nurses hurrying the soon to be parents into a sterile room . newline i did a full on double take at the young couple and managed to utter a couple of words before fully collapsing , this time letting go and giving in to the weight of the situation . newline  mum ... dad ?  newline newline newline newline   rest to follow   newline newlinei actually did nt see it at first . we always had some wear marks on out skin : laugh lines , crows feet , imperfections that told stories of our happiness . newline newline one day i noticed a slight sag to her skin . not that i cared of course , she was my love and it did nt matter what she looked like to me . but i was worried . newline newline a month after that i came home to find her collapsed on our bathroom floor sobbing , he hands full of grey hair . she had been trying to hide it from me for the last year so i would nt worry about her . newline newline i held her as close as i could that night . newline newline three months later she was in a hospital . we both knew it would nt do any good , but it felt good to pretend . she had aged so much in a year and a half that i m sure i looked like a favored grandchild comforting the family matriarch in her passing days , and we did nt correct anyone in order to protect our secret . newline newline she was dying . it mad no sense to pretend otherwise , at least to myself . for her i never let on that i might be worried about her end . i tried to tell myself that it was bound to happen eventually . we ve both seen friends innumerable grow and pass before us . when you re immortal , death is as familiar to you as breathing . newline newline this kind of death was something i have nt known for a very long time . newline newline i would be alone . newline newline i would be the last immortal to walk this earth . newline newline i chose to reject the thought when it would creep back into my waking world  but in my dreams i was always alone calling out into the darkness for her . she was my one comfort in this stupid everchanging world . and she was going to die . newline newline   newline newline it happened on a wednesday . newline newline i was reading to her , as i did most days . on this particular day it was a well worn first edition of the great gatsby , a favorite of hers . newline newline  ... and so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past .  i closed the book and studied the love of my life . she was aged , but it was her . her laugh lines and crows feet and every imperfection that reminded us of the happy 500 years we ve spent together . newline newline  charles ,  her voice had a bittersweet happiness to it ,  it s time .  newline newline i held her hand in mine . she felt so weak . newline newline she smiled at me , a single tear rolled down her cheek , and she was gone . newline newline   newline newline i buried her on hillside in scotland , where no one would be able to disturb her .general yorwax and emperor were watching the latest intelligence report from the first scout ship . it looked like what they saw terrified general that he closed his eyes , even the emperor could nt hide his horror . general took the initiative and closed the transmission newline newline  i believe the invasion plan would be foolish considering  newline newline  you are dissmissed general , i know what you are going to say . it would be futile to wage war against these ... these.. these barbarians ! this kind of aliens deserves to burn in fire pits of god om . now , please leave me alone i need to think.  newline newline  your majesty .  newline newline general left with the report disk crunched in his fist . this would be the last time they would ever visit planet earth . he had to go across the ship and delete the other copy of  painolympic  from the main computer .it was a moment of clarity , but not like you would think . my life perspective was nt clear . the issues i had in life were not suddenly taken back and solved and my true purpose was laid out in front of me like perfect brick road . no , it was pure clarity of all of reality . there was so much to take in , as if every facet of details about every single possible object or event in the history of existence was suddenly mine to play with . if i wanted to know how kurt cobain really died , i would be there instantly in the room where he did actually shoot himself . if i wanted to know how particles get their characteristics i could see the strings that control it . but it was so much deeper than that , i could understand fully how each curve in each unique dimension caused that string to have it s particular effect . each tiny movement growing into the more dymanic creation that is the universe . newline newline it s possible this was all a hallucination , but it just so incredibly vivid . the moment was of pure clarity felt like a life time . all the worries i had ever had were gone , not even close to being remembered . at that point i was no longer myself , i was everything and everything was me . as i moved time moved , as i cried it rained , and life itself existed within and beyond me but i could focus in on each individual . i could focus on the heartbeat of unique creatures from planets unimaginable . newline newline from the moment i stepped off of that skyscraper , everything in the universe had suddenly made sense . i was more comfortable with the knowledge of the universe in those final moments than i had been with the minute details of my entire life up until this point . i was taken back through time to see creatures that dwelled on earth before me , and creatures that still dwell else where in the universe . i was able to see dark matter , and hold a strange particle . i was able to influence politicians into passing laws for me , or convincing a man to hunt down someone who did nt believe in me . i saw both the good and the bad , i felt the balance on good and evil within me . newline newline unfortunately , this feeling was short lived as i quickly crashed back into reality long enough to realize that i had just killed myself . just enough consciousness to regret jumping in the first . yet , with no regret and sudden clarity , i drifted to death peacefully . for that one small moment in time , i was god . newline newline  please critique if possible , trying to get better an criticism is always appreciated .  death , you bastard , why am i still alive ! ?  hansel screamed hoarsely at the fragile old man behind the shack s counter . the lone shack at the end of the bridge at the end of the world . newline newline  because i am preparing you , like a wellmarinated christmas turkey . really , you re quite near the basting stage .  his lips were thinner than nightcrawlers , nearly nonexistent .  now my question to you is when will you stop visiting me ? this is already our 200th meeting , and i m sorry to say that i do nt have an anniversary gift for you . will a hug suffice ?  newline newline hansel clenched his fists .  oh , if you did nt take on such a nimble vessel , the things i would do to mutilate you   newline newline  hush .  newline newline  excuse me ?  newline newline death signaled for hansel to jump behind the shack s wooden counter . newline ou newline not exactly feeling comfortable with the idea , but trusting a man who had outlived him by pretty much the beginning of the universe , hansel did as he was told . newline newline  what s going on , death ?  hansel whispered . newline newline  you do nt have to whisper . i just wanted to get you out of the way before the buffalo stampede killed smashed you into sorry little bits . although , i could have just put you back together , but you know how much that inconveniences me .  newline newline hansel slumped down behind the counter and sat crosslegged .  and yet you always seem to find a way . did you know i buried my greatgreatgreat granddaughter last week ?  newline newline  you revealed yourself to her ?  newline newline  her life was spiraling out of control .  newline newline  no , but why should it matter to you ?  the answer escaped death completely .  please refrain from bringing up the argument that i have no family , and therefore no human attachments . i m quite invested in you , and i think that shall have to be enough for both of our lifetimes .  newline newline  but how long are you intending my life to be exactly ?  hansel asked . he played with a bottle cap that had managed to find a home in a cobwebby corner of the shack s dirty floor .  it has been centuries , and i still do nt look a day over 40 .  newline newline  i have often wondered what age group you ultimately appeal to .  newline newline  that is neither here nor there , death . please , just answer the question ,  hansel pleaded . newline newline  shall i tell you a story about time to make a very simple point that you insist on missing every time we have this discussion ?  newline newline hansel sighed .  what is it ?  newline newline  it s about a king and his bravest , strongest knight . mind you , this story never really happened , so do nt go trying to find references .  newline newline  just tell it to me , death .  newline newline  you have nothing but time .  newline newline hansel frowned .  sometimes i get the feeling i do nt .  newline newline  and there is a reason for that too , if you ll let me tell my story .  newline newline  fine .  newline newline  the king , from a young age , knew that he was very , very different from all of the other children , from all of the other people in the kingdom . he was a prince then , and nobody would say anything to his face , but there was often talk of his reserved , solitary nature . newline newline but none of that mattered to the boy , because despite everything , he loved his kingdom .  newline newline  i know how this goes . you re the king , and i m the knight who is supposed to save your kingdom . is there some sort of secret war coming that i should know about ? maybe prepare for ?  newline newline death shook his head . he shed a few white hairs in the process .  yet again , it escapes you . why must i be the king in this story ?  newline newline  because i m definitely not the king .  newline newline  why not ?  newline newline  why not ? are you serious ?  hansel gestured to himself .  there is not a thing about me that alludes to me being a king .  newline newline  would you let this world end if it were in your power to stop it ?  newline newline hansel paused .  i doubt that s the only qualification .  newline newline  fair enough ,  said death .  how about this one : would you let your world end if it were in your power to stop it ?  newline newline  my world ? how is that any different   newline newline  think , son . reflect . it s in there in that thick skull of yours somewhere . each time you visit me , we simply go through the motions .  newline newline  that s odd ,  hansel said .  i do nt ... i know i visit you often , but i do nt actually recall the specifics of those visits . it s almost as if ...  newline newline he fell into a fetal position clutching his head in pain . the scream that ripped free from his throat was a song alltoofamiliar to death . newline newline  i get a bad reputation , you know ,  death said while hansel squirmed on the floor .  death to you humans is synonymous with the end . but i have the unique ability of stalling death long enough that it becomes preservation . how does that make me the villain in all this ?  newline newline  help ... me ...  hansel spat out the words between grit teeth . his whole world seemed to be melting away . his entire body felt hot as if with fever.. newline newline  your world , hansel . have you seen her recently ?  newline newline her . newline newline the one word itself triggered a host of memories , years upon years worth , of a sleeping knight and the king who vowed to protect her . to one day cure her . newline newline annabella . newline newline  annabella . that s her name ,  hansel said , tears leaking out from his eyes . it hurt just to say the name , and the worst of it was that he had no idea why .  tell me , death .  newline newline death put his hands to either side of hansel s face .  i will show you a dream . find peace in it .  newline newline and the dream began . an old man with a young child . the young child grew up and became a man . he fell in love with his world , but he saw it under the threat of one unstoppable force . his father : death . newline newline but he loved his father . he could never stop him or make him cease to exist . newline newline so his most loyal knight , as powerful as she was beautiful , made a bargain with death . newline newline  let the king know death for what it is . let him understand the frailty of life . let him understand it over and over again until he hates us . until he loathes our very existence . let him know the truth that in the end , there is nothing to love , nothing to save .  newline newline and so death froze the kingdom and sent the king away to a distant land with no memory of his kingdom or of his followers . he did not age , and he did not die , but those around him did , and each and every one pained him until he thought he might go mad . newline newline but he never did , not really . perhaps because he was death s son . newline newline still . newline newline  i have only one question for you , hansel ,  said death .  do you want to save annabella ?  newline newline hansel , his face drenched with tears , opened his mouth . newline newline  very well ,  said death . newline newline   newline newline xposted to my subreddit rlaboratorylux . check it out for more of my stuff !my friend was there that day . of course , that was the whole point . his first move was his knight , as always . i moved my far right pawn , as always . we had played all the time before this day , over small issues . today s stakes were much higher . we were playing for humanity . newline newline he was tall , brown skinned , wore sweatpants and a light running shirt . dressing casually for such an important event was just like him . i , on the other hand , wore a suit . pinstriped , somewhere in between orange and yellow . we sat down at the park bench in between the dead tree and the meadow . both silent , we began . i quickly gained the upper hand , taking his rook and bishop . newline newline  just like old times right ?  he commented . newline newline  not quite  newline newline  i ll miss this game  newline newline  as will i  newline newline  it has been a while . i would ve thought you d stop making that mistake  he said as he took my knight . newline newline  i ve turned it into something useful  i replied as i took the rook that offed my knight . newline newline  smart  newline newline i nodded . newline newline  it s amazing we ve let them go this far alone , yes ?  newline newline  we should have helped  newline newline  which time ?  newline newline i sighed .  exactly  newline newline  you know it s important that they develop .  newline newline  we could have brought order , at least some of the times .  newline newline  order is important , but also , how the order is brought  newline newline i grunted , and moved a pawn . newline newline  friend , look over there , at the two humans .  newline newline  what about them ?  newline newline  they re bickering . they ve been fighting ever since we started the game . if they broke off their relationship right now , it would bring order , no ? but it would have horrible repercussions for the both of them . it s much better for them to finish their argument , and move on .  newline newline  i suppose .  newline newline  check  newline newline i grunted in acknowledgement , taking his queen and effectively leaving my state of check . newline newline  and what if they argue and argue , make eachother feel like garbage , and break it off anyway ?  i asked newline newline  that s a possibility , yes  newline newline  then under those circumstances , it would have been easier to just break it off ?  newline newline  i suppose  newline newline  check .  i said . newline newline he moved . newline newline  they ve calmed down  newline newline  i see that  newline newline  so my way worked  newline newline  in this case , yes  newline newline  in most cases  newline newline  well , that s to be discovered at the end of this game now , is nt it ?  newline newline  it is , it is  newline newline we played that game for three days . three days , that couple came back to that park bench , and talked . they talked , bickered , kissed , fought , made up , until eventually ... newline newline  checkmate  newline newline newline newlinewhat is it about our generation that makes us so baffled by the passage of time ? when someone says  back in 2006  and you think , that was such a long time ago ... but wait that s only ten years ... but wait that s half my life time ago ... when the heck did i grow up ? newline newline i m making all of these decisions , career choices , trying to figure out where i want to be and who i want to be and what i want to be for the rest of my life , i m not ready for this . newline newline the city lights on the horizon mock me , they twinkle at me , dazzling with their brightness and their promises . is anyone ever really ready ? newline newline i m so scared of getting stuck , being boring , not living life to the fullest , yet somehow i go through each day and feel like it s wasted  go to class , to work , do homework , study for midterms , maybe watch some netflix , go to sleep . wake up , repeat . again , again , again . newline newline there are little things that make me happy of course , watching the sunset like tonight , good books and good music , friends , but when the sky is dark and full of mysteries , all those fears bubble up to the surface again , swirling around in my head and making me feel like a child again . newline newline but i m an adult . a grown up . when the hell did this happen ? newline newline knees pulled up , arms wrapped around them trying to make myself as small as possible , i look at the scattered beer cans around me and make a decision . newline newline all of those things i ve been thinking about for the last couple years that seemed ridiculous or out of reach : i m going to do them . start with something small , like getting one of those ear piercings that make you look like a pirate , or dying my hair a crazy color . and when i ve built up enough courage , i might even drop this whole stem career pressure bullshit and do something i love . play my flute , back pack across europe , write a novel . because i can sit here in a pit of useless nostalgia wondering what happened to myself , and before i know it those twenty years i m looking back on mournfully will be forty , sixty , and then nothingness . newline newline or i can do something about it . newline newline suddenly those lights look a little brighter , and for the first time in a long time , i smile .i wrote this for this prompt , and it can be read on its own , but it s also chapter 2 of a longer story in the making . chapter one can be found here : https : www.reddit.comrwritingpromptscomments40kcccslugcyuxm27 enjoy !  newline newline newline newline i stared at the id in my hand for a while longer , and kicked the body in front of me in frustration . newline newline fuck fuck fuck .  newline newline two days it had taken them . for two blissful days , i d lived in a normal world again , with actual people . it was a pretty nice world i had ended up in , too . apparently , though , it was nt meant to be . they actually wanted to drag me back to that barren place . and for what ? so i could live there on my own ? waiting till i died of old age or because of some accident ? being reminded everyday of what i had done ? newline newline fuck that .  newline newline i knew one thing , it was gon na be a lot harder once they d caught me and brought me back , at least while in jail . i d heared they make sure you ca nt just do it again . no ropes in your room , no sharp objects , nothing you could choke on , total isolation . i grimaced . worst come to worst i can always bite my tongue off .  newline newline the sirens were getting louder , and even though it was nt them that i was worried about , i d better get going . it would nt do to be here when the suicide squad came back with backup . besides , i needed as much of a head start as possible to figure out how to stay hidden for more than two days this time . i had killed myself because i was done with just surviving , i wanted to live . two day stays were nt going to cut it . newline newline i walked over to the body of goon number 2 and pulled the shard of glass out of his throat . i took one last look around the bistro , eyes ending on bob . he was watching me , baseball bat still in hand , a grim look of understanding on his face . newline newline  take care  , i told him , while i lifted the shard to my throat . i d do whatever it would take to get away from my past and live a normal life . newline newline again and again .  newline newline newline bears ?  supreme invasion commander seven said . newline newline  yes , sir . bears ,  ground commander fiftyfour replied . newline newline  bears .  seven said . newline newline  yes , sir .  newline newline  let me get this straight ,  seven said .  bears ?  newline newline  yes .  fiftyfour confirmed . newline newline  mammals ? about yay big , furry ? portrayed as having a love of honey and picnic baskets ?  seven asked . perhaps fiftyfour had gotten them confused for something larger and scarier , like a mountain . newline newline  yes , those bears .  newline newline  so , you re saying we traveled thousands of lightyears  no , no , let me back up . you re saying we invented fasterthanlight travel  no , no , no , still not far back enough . we invented artificial gravity for our spacecraft no , no , still no good .  newline newline  in my defense  fiftyfour tried to speak up . newline newline  i m not done ! our species is the culmination of billions of years of evolution , a process that , i apparently have to remind you , involves things like fighting against large predators ! we are the apex of our species , masters of our planet s natural resources as well as that of countless hundreds of colonies ! and you re telling me that you ca nt fight bears ?  seven demanded . newline newline  they re scary !  fiftyfour said plaintively . newline newline  fiftyfour ?  seven asked . newline newline  yes sir ?  newline newline  you re fired .  seven said . he turned to the nexthighestranking subordinate , fiftyfive .  fiftyfive , are you also afraid of bears ?  newline newline fiftyfive seemed to consider .  i m not not afraid of bears .  newline newline seven sighed .  to hell with this planet , then . drop its moon on it and let s go home . it has been hard getting work lately . since the king outlawed all formians . newline we are nt all bad . i mean , sure there were plenty of raiding parties that newline were unnecessarily violent , and we did capture nearly every sheep from newline athkatla to winterkeep . i guess we really broke the camels back when newline we tunneled into his trophy room and stole his prized amulet . ever since newline then it has been open season on every formian , and since he is paying newline a gold piece per head every twobit adventurer has begun clambering newline into our tunnels and breaking into old forts looking for us . newline newline i guess that is why i took this job . the pay was nt great but the job newline is easy . some necromancer wants me to stand in a hallway and wait to see if anyone comes through ? like anyone will get past the bugbear he s got guarding the entrance , or the horde of undead he has between there and here . i suppose i look a little out of place compared to all these other monsters , but who am i to judge ? newline newline here lately there have been some weird smells coming from the door behind newline me . i think my employer is experimenting again , and from the smell of it i would say it was nt very popular in life either . i hope he gets done soon so that i can go back to my colony , or what is left of it by now . newline newline crash newline newline woah , what was that ? all right , you ve been trained for this.. just stay perfectly still unless someone comes through the door . it will be alright man , do nt worry . be calm . newline newline suddenly a trap door from above reveals itself and a halfling plummets through landing with a soft crunch newline newline oh shit oh shit . i better do something.. uh ... why do i always froget this part , oh yeah ! newline newline the formian pulls out his spear and advances towards the halfling , but halfway there he notices a rope that has begun descending from the trap door newline newline oh great , the only people that carry that much rope are adventurers ... well , i had a good life i suppose . only one thing to do now , and that is take this little runt with me . newline newline as the formian closes in on the halfling the rope suddenly goes tight and the halfling zips out of sight the same way he came .  newline newline huh , well.. i guess i will just go and stand back over here . maybe they wo nt come this way . newline newline fighting can be heard in the distance newline newline gulp well , there s enough undead between them and me , i doubt they will make it . like mother always said , 1 in 5 adventurers is just as dumb as you . i should probably put my spear away before i forget . you never know when there will be a surprise inspection . i wonder if that halfling was a friend of the boss ? maybe i should tell him.. nah , he s busy . newline newline suddenly the door in front of our formidable formian bursts forth , revealing four frenzied fleshpods . they scan the room for a few seconds looking past the formian and scanning for traps . one notes the hole in the ceiling and the halfling pushes to the front and confirms with the others . whispers are had between the four and then giggling ensues . meanwhile the formian is dumbstruck at what he is seeing .  newline newline remember your training , go after the weak first , and bring honor to your newline colony . i feel like i m forgetting something.. owell , charge ! ! newline newline the formian rushes up to the halfling , but in his panic he forgot to draw his weapon , he begins to make stabbing motions before he realizes what he has done . the halfling straightens up and begins saying something to the formian that he does nt quite understand .  newline newline what is he saying ? is he making fun of me because i forgot my spear ? oh , wait , that ca nt be right . he says they are all formians as well.. how did i not notice newline that earlier ? it is very clear now . i am so glad my fellow insectoids have decided newline to visit me . wait , what ? they are here to kill my boss ? well , we probably should nt guys i mean ... oh , it is for the queen ? hmm.. perhaps they will let me return to the colony as a hero ! newline in that case , right this way . newline newline the formian leads the adventurers through the door to the lair of the necromancer . once inside the necromancer begins to yell and shout at the formian sending the few remaining undead after him and the adventurers .  newline newline charge ! ! newline newline the formian rushes the necromance and stabs at him wildly , however once again he has forgotten his spear and he now must resort to kicking and slapping the old mage . the other adventurers quickly dispatch the undead and form a half circle around the fight .  newline newline what are they waiting for ? there is no way i can destroy the boss on my own ! newline is this a test ? must i prove myself to them ? if only i had remembered my spear . newline newline a flash of dark magic shoots the formian across the room where he crumples into a pile . the adventurers swarm the nearly spent necromancer and destroy him after only a few moments . they then turn their gaze on the crippled creature in the corner .  newline newline i see now , i was tricked . they are not formians , not brothers . i have disgraced the colony . if only i was strong enough to fight back . if only i had stayed to be a worker instead of trying to have adventures and make something of myself . newline newline the halfling walks over to the fallen formian and holds out a vial , he explains that it is a healing potion and that they will leave now , and that the formian may live another day newline newline what a kindness , i will never forget you fleshy creatures . i will tell stories of you to my colony . whats that ? you do nt know where my colony is ? well it is nt far from here actually ... newline newline the formian tells his new found friends the whereabouts of his colony so that they may bless his brothers and queen with their kindness . he smiles a formian smile and drink the potion as the adventurers leave .  newline newline today was nt such a bad da ... newline newline his words are cut off as he bursts into flames , the bottle rolling away the words on the label reading  alchemists fire  . if only he had learned to read the common tongue , then perhaps his story would have ended differently , but then again he was just a formian .  smile , jim !  mother is happy as she pulls me through the fair .  jim , you like the sea , do nt you ?  i nod , smudging ice cream on my nose . i like ice cream , mother says i liked it even when i was a baby .  we can go there , jim !  . newline newline we stop at a bench and we sit down . there is a pond , and i look at the ducks .  jim , say it . say how much you like the sea .  i look up at mother then nod , uncertainly .  i ... like the sea . i want to go to the sea .  mother smiles at me , and says something at the sky . some of the words i know  ocean , child , trip . and some i do nt  ewetilty rayshow ? we sit on the bench , and after a while a car comes and takes us to the sea . some people look funny at the car , i think because it is on on the path . they have to step off the path to let the car go past . newline newline at the sea i swim in the waves with mother . we have a good time . mother says i liked the sea even when i was a little baby . there is a boat , and mother tells me to say how much i like boats . the people in the boat get out , and we sail around the sea until the sun goes down and i am very tired and we go home . newline newline at home we eat dinner , then we go to my room and i get into bed and mother tucks in the sheets . i like my room , i like the paintings on the walls and stars on the ceiling and my bed . mother is about to turn out the light , but she then looks around my room and she is nt smiling .  jim , you would like to live in a new house , would nt you ? say you want to live in a new house .  she smiles at me and bends down really close and i ca nt see my room any more .  say it , jim .  hey ! you two , at the car ! hold up ! wait !  newline newline it was an older man , slight in form , and a little misdressed for the time of year . georgia winters are nt as cold as most , but they certainly do nt warrant shorts and collared tshirts . the two new parents only gave him a moment to approach them out of curiosity , and they had a fair amount of it . this was at the hospital , and they were only just now leaving with their newborn . it took a considerable level of curiosity to overcome their newfound defensiveness . newline newline he was quite obviously rushed . there were a few windfolded papers in his hands , and the way he ran to them suggested an incompetence at running rather than malicious intent . as he neared them , he slowed to a jog and ran his papered hand through his hair . newline newline  hey guys !  he chirped , and his excitement bled through all too clearly . the father glanced to the mother , who held the baby in their car carrier . the thin old man looked from father to mother with the widest smile his face could bear . he went to start saying something a couple times , only getting his lips to move before he involuntarily smiled again . newline newline finally , again : newline newline  hey guys .  this time softer . newline newline  i ca nt believe i ve waited this long to ...  he kept moving his gaze between the two as they waited to hear the reason they were being kept from their drive home . he looked down , back to them , and then brought his open hand to his lips . newline newline  look , i ... let me start over . guys , it s a pleasure for me to be here . i ... you do nt know me , let me get that out .  he offered , opening his palm to them . newline newline  and i do nt know you , per se . i just happened to have some ...   he thought for a moment   free time ! yes , free time . ah , and so i decided to ... well , that is , this little man ! i mean , it s the beginning of his life !  newline newline he was clearly losing their interest and raising their defenses , so he began a different tactic . addressing them from one knee , he , as gently as he could at this point , requested to see the babe . newline newline  bring ... bring bring him over here . can i see him ? just a look ! just a look ... yes , yes , protect him as i look at him .  the father had kept himself between the carrier and the old man . newline newline the old man sighed in awe at the babe , who was asleep . despite the cold , the man had a composure about him . he glanced up at the parents , now speaking in a reverent whisper . newline newline  you know , this one s ... well , he s ... i ve been nearly my whole life trying to ...  he looked back to the bundle in the carrier and brought his hand back to his mouth . after a few moments just observing the babe , he backed away and stood back up . he wagged his pointer finger next to his face : newline newline  that one s ... he s a handful !  he gazed at the carrier for another moment , and then shuffled through the papers he had . newline newline  listen guys , it s really been an honor  i ve got ... i ve got an appointment ...  he extended a hand to the father , but upon receiving no handshake , he sighed . newline newline  okay , well uh , i really wish ... well  again , it s been an honor , guys .  he bowed away from them and walked back to the sidewalk . with one last glance to the carrier , he ran back off the way he came . newline newline newline  newline newline i was planning to write more , but this prologue got away from me . what do you want me to do next ?  asked jon as he uploaded the latest reviews . newline newline  can you go to the server room and check on t2a63 for me ?  replied mr. hollinsworth as he went back into his corner office overlooking the gleaming towers that comprised downtown . newline newline t2a63 was a location identification number . a way for the employees to track each piece of equipment in the server room . the number mr. hollinsworth had asked jon to inspect resided at the far end of the room , tucked away in the very last case of row t2 . newline newline jon popped the latch open on the server s housing and performed the typical diagnostics . everything looks fine , he told himself as he reached for the latch door . newline newline as his hand went to close the housing he noticed a note on the door . he looked behind him to make sure no one was nearby and pulled the tape off the piece of paper . jon unfolded the note and read : newline newline you are a clone of your former self . i know this wo nt make much sense , but you are a nearly perfect being . they take great care to rid you of any ailments and transplant all your memories .  newline newline i say this with extreme caution that i ve noticed your memories are nt the same as they once were . you recall events that have occured in your past that i know happened differently . i fear that they altered your memories to best suit some need of theirs . for what purpose , i m not sure . normally i would nt say anything , seeing as many clones work around us everyday , but i have never seen so many inconsistencies with memory like i have with yours . we can talk more about this in private tonight after work at brother s lounge . i feel like i will likely come to regret this , but this company has some secrets that you may need to know of ...  newline newline jon stood up slowly and looked around once more . it s not addressed to anyone and has no other name to identify the writer , he thought to himself . he closed the latch and slid the note into his back pocket . not quite sure what to make of the situation , jon decided he would keep cool and pretend like he did nt see the letter . this has to be some kind of joke .  newline newline as jon exited the server room he walked back down the hall thinking he would take a trip past mr. hollinsworth s office to see if he acted any differently now , assuming he penned the note . newline newline hollinsworth was a class act , always pulling pranks on his employees . i must admit , this one is creative . with a big fake smile and on his face , jon whistled a few lines as he round the corner . what the hell ?  jon s smile immediately turned into a frozen look of terror . it took every muscle in his face to remain collected . a feeling of immense heat rose through his whole body and could not move another step forward . there was a group of his coworkers huddled around hollinsworth s office , several of whom were crying , consoling each other . paramedics were crouched around a figure laying still on the floor . newline newline jon darted back around the corner , ran to his cubicle , and grabbed his keys . he knew there was one place he could get an answer .the cafeteria was dark and moist . calvin knew not why , or what he was doing here , but very quickly he soon came to learn about it , and it was about as fun as weak lukewarm coffee . newline newline  stand up , calvin ,  boomed a thunderous voice from somewhere in the dark . newline newline calvin did so . before him were two portly men , chefs that wore their greasy aprons and hats , leering down at him . calvin looked around , and where there had once been rows and rows of empty tables and round plastic stools there sat a full five hundred people staring at him . all silent , unblinking , and all a strange shade of green . newline newline he looked back in front . the chef to his left picked up a fork and pointed it at calvin . newline newline  you have been brought here to answer for the most horrific of crimes .  a collective shudder ran around the cafeteria .  a crime so monstrous , a successful case has only been brought once , in the history of this court . you have been accused of ...  newline newline calvin held his breath . newline newline  ... first degree burger desecration .  newline newline everyone around gasped . newline newline  how do you plead ?  the judge continued . newline newline calvin , however , started to chuckle softly , then stopped when he realised how guilty he sounded . newline newline  i plead not guilty . i want a lawyer !  newline newline  you could have had one ,  the chef sneered back .  under food law , the lawyer has to be someone you know who can vouch for your character . unfortunately , your supervisor  ah  he claims to not know you as anything other than a criminally insane firstclass burgerburning dolt . as such , you may choose to represent yourself , or   newline newline  i ll represent myself , thanks ,  calvin said , standing up a little straighter . newline newline  very well ,  the chefjudge said .  prosecutor ! bring in the first witness .  newline newline a silence descended back on the cafeteria . the prosecutor , wearing a chestplate of a frying pan and shows of pot lids , stepped forward from the gloom . calvin had to suppress another chuckle at the man s odd appearance . newline newline but whatever laughter there was died when calvin saw the witness . newline newline  you ?  calvin blurted .  how could you  newline newline  silence !  the chef roared .  what is your name and profession ?  he asked . newline newline the witness , a tall , older man with balding hair and wirerimmed glasses , nodded in respect .  i am alan storrar . i am a regular customer at that  at that godawful burger place .  newline newline the prosecutor took over .  could you describe to the food court what you tasted ?  newline newline alan nodded , looking at anywhere but calvin .  i tasted that burger  oh , it was burnt so badly , and the meat so rotten and godawful the spirit of gordon ramsay is still screaming   newline newline the entire court winced . calvin shot a quick glance over to the jury , twelve men and women in masterchefstyle clothing , and he had to shudder . there was nothing but guilty written there . newline newline  and who was it that did this ?  newline newline alan looked away , as if he could nt bear to say so , then pointed one crooked finger at calvin . newline newline  it was him , your honour ! he destroyed the good name of food  he committed unspeakable crimes against food .  newline newline  very well ,  the judge said .  the witness may be recused . now if the prosecutor could  newline newline  wait a minute ,  calvin interrupted .  do nt i get to cross examine the witness  newline newline  you get nothing , accused !  the chefs roared back .  now sit still and hear the charges brought against you .  newline newline  but i have no rights here !  calvin blurted out . newline newline  you got that right ,  the judge said , smiling .  alright , let s move on with calling the next witness , then we can send this pathetic idiot to the broccoli mines  newline newline calvin stared at the judges so hard they stopped . newline newline  i have no rights ,  he repeated .  am i not now still innocent ?  was this some crazy ass dream ?   what about ... everything ? all the evidence ? presumption of innocence ?  newline newline  you think this is like one of your stupid court shows , accused ?  the prosecutor sneered .  this is nt anything like it . in here we do not discriminate according to lettuce size or how many five star reviews you have . you are all equally guilty !  newline newline  no way ,  calvin said , desperately trying to think of a way out . he d seen the trick once , he thought , as his mind cycled through the possibilities . competition . chefs . game shows . judge judy and the people s court tv series ...  newline newline a lightbulb flashed on . newline newline  i wish to confess ,  calvin said . newline newline momentarily , the prosecutor seemed stunned .  you wish to confess ?  newline newline  nah , just joking ,  calvin said , laughing .  i just wanted to get your attention . but now that i have it , i ll tell you highandmighties one thing  i did not desecrate that burger . it was the most lovely shade of brown you have ever seen . and i know i ll get no justice here  so i will let the high chefs decide my fate .  newline newline calvin lowered his voice , to where the entire cafeteria

                              newline newline  one must have survived ...  newline newline ducita s bark was a level whisper , but the ice in her eyes was colder than the snow that fell serenely over them . newline newline three immense grey wolves stood before her . the last great warriors of their pack , perhaps even their kind . newline newline they were exhausted . the battle had lasted well into the night , and the pack had lost many brothers and sisters . they were heading home to their tribe after what they thought would be the final assault on this district , but if their ears had not deceived them , their night was not over . newline newline a  belua  had survived , and by the sounds of him a big one . an angry one . newline newline dux , the alpha male , assessed his troops sympathetically . feror , their most vicious soldier , bore the brunt of the damage . his coat was matted with blood , a dull maroon glowing in the snow . a large crooked gash streaked from the back of his right ear  which now hung by a few nimble threads  to the side of his neck . newline newline to a civilian he would look close to death , but dux was a seasoned veteran . there was more blood behind feror s eyes than what was spilled tonight . his cuts were not deep , and the loss of his ear was superficial . he was ready to fight again , perhaps even excited to . newline newline dux gave feror a curt nod , which was returned with gusto . he shifted his gaze to his second in command , agisteri . the wise wolf showed no signs of damage , on first glance it would seem there was no difference between the wolf that entered their battle fresh , to the wolf that stood before them now . but the eyes do not lie . the cost of avoiding damage is exhaustion , and agisteri was spotless . once a bold young feror had claimed that soldiers without battle scars were cowards . many years fighting alongside agisteri had changed his opinion . no easy feat . however , the fact still remained , agisteri was the most tired of the four . when it came to killing a belua , dux assessed exhaustion as a severe battle wound . newline newline dux looked on towards his final soldier , his son , pectus . the young wolf was a spitting image of his father , if not for his smaller size and lighter coat . he had fought alongside dux as new warriors do , though three of the four young wolves had perished where pectus had survived . whether or not dux had taken an active interest in keeping his son alive over his other soldiers , was a mental battle he would have if they survived the physical one looming before them . dux s young heart was beating eagerly , and thought he was inexperienced , his health and alertness were great assets this late in battle . the only wolf in better shape than dux s three soldiers was ducita , their guide . newline newline ducita was not of their tribe . she was an iberian wolf from the bordering adcolian district . sagax , ducita s alpha , had ordered her to guide dux s soldiers through the adcolian wilderness in order to eliminate the belua horde that had ravaged her tribe . she had led them to the belua , but had kept a reasonable distance from the battle . dux did nt blame her . newline newline there was one last wolf for dux to assess , and that was dux himself . the gray wolf s hulking figure towered over the other four . from a distance you would swear a young belua was walking towards you  and many young wolves had run home thinking so  . newline newline up close his appearance was not much softer . three jagged scars ran from the top of his great head to the tip of his snout , a part of his nose missing , as if his creator had forgotten to colour in his nose completely . his coat was the darkest shade of grey , that at night time he was merely a shadow . if you did not look twice at dux , you would think him a beast , a true freak of nature . but the eyes of a wolf do not lie . you would find no savageness there . behind those windows was an endlessly vast ocean . beautifully tranquil and calm , but an immensely awesome power lay in its waters . heaven help the fool who provokes a storm . newline newline dux took a deep breath , and prepared to speak . but before he could deliver his orders , a murderous , blood curdling roar broke the silence again . it was a true monster ... and it was nt far . newline newline  pectus , on me . we will approach it from the front . feror , you will run as far east as you can without losing our scent . agisteri you will do the same to the west . when you hear my signal , feror will run like the hounds of hell are at his heels , and flank our unwanted guest with all his might .  newline newline dux paused for the spirited  or bloodthirsty  response from feror that usually followed his orders , but it did not come . he simply began moving east . a shadow of doubt crossed dux s mind . perhaps he had wrongly assessed his wounds . it was too late to replan , he would have to maintain faith . newline newline he continued . newline newline  agisteri , i want you to conserve your energy , approach at a slower pace to assess the situation . if it s wounds are heavy , and you can finish him , you must . newline newline ... newline newline if we have failed completely , you must outrun the beast back to domusta , prepare who is able for battle.  newline newline  understood .  agisteri gave a curt nod before heading west . newline newline dux turned to ducita . newline newline  this is where you leave us . you must go to domusta and let my people know of what has transpired .  newline newline  i am honoured to have served alongside your warriors .  ducita replied , bowing low . newline newline  honour me by reaching domusta in one piece .  dux said shortly . newline newline ducita bounded off to the north . newline newline dux moved closer to pectus . father and son were shoulder to shoulder . they stood in silence , but with calm understanding . two wolves silhouetted against the beautifully layered snow , enjoying the small flakes that landed and melted on their tired tongues . newline newline crack newline newline a large tree branch had snapped not too far in front of them , and the belua s stench filled their noses . newline newline  on guard son .  newline newline  newline newline feror newline newline                                               newline newline feror walked steadily east . he had hidden the extent of his wounds successfully from dux . and his wounds extended from adcolion to domasta . ten times over . a particularly vicious belua had thrust a claw inbetween his ribs , to what felt like his lower lung . newline newline dux would have ordered him to go home had he known , but feror knew the odds . agisteri was exhausted , and pectus too young . that left only one able warrior , dux , to fend off the attack . newline newline feror would not let his brothers and sisters die alone , just so he may live . besides , there was no guarantee the healers in domasta could fix him anyway . newline newline but with each step , his breath began to get harsher , his vision blurrier . and a chilling thought began to invade feror s mind . newline newline what if i ca nt make it back to them ?  newline newline the bloodied grey wolf came to a stop . newline newline he had a decision to make , and the now familiar smell tickling his nostrils told him  he would have to make it fast . newline newline  newline newline pectus newline newline                                                        newline newline a strained , ragged howl pierced through the black night to the east . newline newline feror ?  newline newline pectus looked to his father in bewilderment . newline newline the young wolf s muscles were tight . his blood hot with anticipation of battle , but his concentration was broken . though a bold fighter , inheriting much of his instinct from his father , pectus was still very inexperienced on the battlefield  improvisation was not his strong suit . he was slightly embarrassed that in this moment , he was relieved to have his father next to him in the unforgiving snow . newline newline dux had not yet responded . his gaze fixed intensely in front of him , where the branch had cracked . even now , pectus still found his fathers presence intimidating . he , like agisteri , was free from any battle damage , and he was not foolish enough to believe it was of his own doing . there were many instances where he was careless , not checking his blind spots often in the heat of his attacks , only to turn and see his father dragging an enemy away from him . how many times did dux render this service to pectus  brothers and sisters ? the distance dux kept between them after battle gave him an inkling . newline newline none .  newline newline  should we go to hi ?  newline newline  it is moving away from us ... to the east .  dux interrupted . newline newline pectus brought his focus back to his senses . it s scent was certainly fainter , and no longer in front of them . the snow had stopped falling . the night now eerie , too still , like a bated breath before a plunge off a waterfall . newline newline suddenly , dux bounded from his post . galloping full speed to the east . pectus only hesitated for a quarter second , before following his leader . newline newline his muscles were tight again , his blood hot , and head steady . the chase was on . newlineashes fell from the sky like rain behind him . a forest fire , slowly dying out . somewhere in the distance , sirens ceased their wailing . micah no longer had any business there . he turned , and found himself on a cool green hill . newline newline a white mist hung over the hills , but below the city was nearly drowned in the dense fog . micah reached down to pat the side of his pale horse . do you hear it too ?  newline newline the beast whinnied , shaking a colorless mane with an eerie lack of vigor . micah felt nearly as apathetic as his steed . the girl s face still flickered in his mind . newline newline they began their slow descent , the man and his horse . the saddle had been worn in so many patches that it had no sheen left , and was once again a single shade . he imagined that his heart , should he still have one , would be the same muddled hue . newline newline he d hurt her , he knew . he d treated her unfairly . yet he could nt bring himself to care , except in a distant sort of way . the same regret one might feel for a pet whose tail they d stepped on once , a few weeks ago . newline newline it was nt that he had no feeling . he did , of course . it s just that his feeling had been ... muted , somehow , by the long , dull shadow of time . newline newline nearing the smogfilled city , he regretted her a bit more . the single spot of color in a long , colorless life . like the buildings here , blending together in their sameness . something was lacking . originality , perhaps . modern , yes , and clean , but without a soul . even what passed for modern art  was lacking personality . newline newline micah shook off the thought as he tied his fourlegged companion to a parking meter in front of his destination . newline newline once , this had been a grand hotel , rich with life and color and emotion . sturdy doors of golden oak engraved with cherubs had swung open , grasped by bowing , redcoated doormen in gold tasseled hats . newline newline the lobby , a social provingground , had been filled with laughing , chattering women in bright gowns and jolly men vying for their attention . chandeliers had spilled orange light on pink tile . a man in crushed blue velvet played the pianoforte in one corner , while in the other , a solemn clerk waited behind his gleaming mahogany counter . newline newline now it was nothing more than another metal and glass monstrosity amid a million others . bah . micah wished he could see it now as it had been , thinking perhaps that would lift his spirit . the vague prayer went , as most prayers tend to do , unanswered . newline newline the new monochrome lobby was filled with faceless drones in offblack suits and white oxford collars , working away the best years of their lives in careers which enriched neither their minds nor their bodies . newline newline he made the elevator , and the soulless music did nothing to ease his despair . is it all gone ?  he wondered . everything that once made life worth living ?  newline newline from one of the rooms he could hear the happy calls of children . a woman was reading to them . newline newline perhaps all was not lost , then . newline newline  toto ,  she was saying .  i do nt think we re in kansas anymore .  newline newline a man s voice broke in .  ca nt you keep them quiet ? here , play with one of these apps , that s what they re there for .  newline newline ... or perhaps it was . newline newline when he entered the suite across the hall , another faceless drone turned to greet him . newline newline  wrong room , buddy ,  the drone said . newline newline  no ,  said micah .  i m afraid not .  newline newline the man turned toward the bed , going , micah supposed , for the phone on the bedside table . instead , he stiffened , and turned back to micah . newline newline  no ,  he said .  please . i have a wife . two girls . they re back in keokuk , waiting for me .  newline newline micah eyed him curiously . not very original . not that he d expected anything . newline newline  please ,  the drone said again .  i love them .  newline newline the smell of a woman s perfume oozed from his collar .  of course you do ,  micah said . he struggled to keep the sigh from his voice . one must remain professional , after all . he made his slow , steady way across the room . newline newline  stop ,  the drone wept .  my family . my wife . have nt you ever been in love ?  newline newline  many times ,  micah said . it was true . he d loved many , each in their own way . still , when he had a job to do , he did it . newline newline her face flashed through his mind again . not the most beautiful face in the world , but when she smiled that shy smile , and her green eyes met his own cold , dead ones ... newline newline  i can give you money !  newline newline micah shook his head . he reached out a cold hand and touched the man with a single finger . the drone vanished , leaving only a bloated lump of flesh on the bed across the room . newline newline no need for dramatic cloaks and intimidating scythes . the job itself was enough . newline newline she had nt offered money . she d been original . she d seen his sorrow .  wait ,  she d said .  while i tell you a story .  newline newline he d laughed , then . for the first time in centuries .  and play shahryar to your scheherazade ?  newline newline rather than deny it was a ploy , she d winked at him .  are you asking me to marry you , my king ?  newline newline and so he had let her spin her tale , and as in the old fable , she d stretched it on for 1,001 nights . he listened . he grew to love her . but in the end , he could not spare her . his job was more important than any king s . newline newline he was death . and he rode his pale horse , in a colorless world . newline newline and he rode alone . newline newline newline        newline newline i did nt see any other replies as full stories . sorry if it s not allowed , and i hope you can figure out the color ! :  newlinesmall child : oh yay we re going to disney , this is going to be fun ! i bet we get to have pizza and see mickey mouse and ride all the rides and go splash in water and drink a big soda and get some popcorn and wear micky mouse ears and  and then all i heard was a big noise like a car trying to stop real fast and then i felt a big bang , like bang , and i knew my neck was hurting and my sister was crying . i tried to yell for my mommy but she was holding her tummy and her chair was moved up more so her tummy was on the wheel . and then a fire truck came and there was a big man who took us out of the car and put me and my sister on the sidewalk and people in the other cars were looking at us and we were still crying then they took my mommy into the back of a ambulance and the big man told us she would be ok. newline newline adult : oh yay i have to drag two kids around disney all day while i m cooking up another one . i swear to god , if my water breaks while we re out today i m gon na   well , that was my thought process right before the wreck . some asshole flew up behind the van doing about 70 or something when we were stopped at a light . he locked his brakes up 20 feet away and slammed into us . threw me and my unborn child forward into the steering wheel . i had my two young children in the back and they were wearing their seatbelts so they were nt injured other than the burn on their necks from the seatbelt . they were hysterical after it happened . i tried to keep it together but the pain was too much and i started crying too . i was rushed to the hospital where i ended up having my baby prematurely . and you know what ? the asshole who hit us drove away . did nt even stop to check if we were alright after plowing into a van with two young kids and a pregnant woman . he got away with it too . newline newline   newlinei focus too much on  the accident  and what it took from me .  the accident  , as my mother exclusively refers to it , was exactly that . an accident . i know this , but it does nt make me feel any less guilty when i ca nt sleep at night . newline newline my dad taught me to drive when i was 16 in an old red farm pickup with paint flaking off the doors . dad was a seasoned pro , raised on tractors and trucks . there seemed to be some unwritten rule in our family that kept my sister and me in the house while my brothers helped with farm work and driving heavy machinery . maybe that  s the way it was for a reason . i was nt some reckless daredevil behind the wheel  just a nervous kid who could barely reach the pedals . newline newline one wednesday after school , we drove from one side of the county and back again . my hands were white knuckled and sweaty , clutching at 10 and 2 . he yelled when i braked and he yelled more when i did nt . he was nt a particularly paranoid person , but a father that wanted his child safe behind the wheel . he drilled me on four way stops , lectured me on distracted driving , and taught me to parallel park between two hay bales in a pasture filled with cattle . newline newline we set off down a side road and he turned the radio up as he warbled along to a dated willie nelson song . as each moment passed , i felt more and more at ease . newline newline  that  s it ,  he urged ,  straighten the wheels and keep your speed up !  newline newline i can remember looking over at him and laughing , delighting in the pride that stretched his smile from ear to ear . i started to press my foot slightly harder on the gas as we tore down the gravel road . newline newline at least that s a story i like to imagine . my dad died six weeks before my 16th birthday when he hit his head and drowned ... newline newline newline how ... ?  i ask , looking at this stranger , someone with the same name as me . how can this be ? is it a glitch in the naming system , some sort of unknown error , or has my whole life been a lie ? i have to know . i muster the courage to finish my question .  how can we have the same name ?  newline the man calmly responds . newline  single space before the name . instead of  micheal  it s just  micheal  . may be the exact same name but technically it s different . ca nt believe nobody has thought to do it .  newline  huh .  i say to this clever stranger .  what a relief .  newlinei should have realized how absurd the situation was becoming before i even broke orbit . the warning signs were there . even the streaks of fire rising up to meet my landing craft would have been a decent point to back out , but no , all i was was all in . now they  ve burned my ships and i  m stuck on this rock . newline newline honestly the signs were clear from the moment my fleet rose up out of quantum and i was blasted with the incessant radio transmissions of this world . newline newline at first i thought there  d been a mistake . i thought my brood host had shunted me off toward another integrated world , an impossible to believe mistake , but i was grasping at straws those first few orbits . the number of individual signals was immense . the only thing like it to my knowledge was a brood world that had its units augmented through cybernetic adhesion . newline newline i peered down at the world , and sure enough the surface was covered with a vast array of units in cities and towns , all over really , almost all of them broadcasting via some little piece of hardware . to my surprise , none i could see was directly linked to their devices . most carried them in cloth coverings strapped to their sides . newline newline i thought it was strange , again , another warning sign , but hey , aliens . what are you gon na do ? if the local host didn  t like physical integration , who was i to argue ? i was just here to conquer the planet . newline newline i picked over the transmissions , there was zero cohesion . it was impossibly chaotic . i couldn  t believe it . my only explanation at the time was that the local brood was in some calibration stage of its digital overlay , weeding out faulty hardware or broken operating units . newline newline it  s almost funny looking back . in that moment i thought i  d caught a lucky break . that much distortion in my opponent s mind ? it was the perfect time to attack . newline newline a weird rush of perspectives pulsed through me as the units i would use as my ground forces dropped out of cryostorage . newline newline millions of my eyes watched millions of my hands pick up weapons and armor . millions of my feet hit the deck plating as they marched through berthing docks into landing craft . preparations were made , targets surveyed and locked in , each the first strokes of a battle plan that would be all too easy with the enemy so unprepared . i even wondered if it would be bloodless , if i would land and just march through its cities flipping units over to my hoard without resistance . i had a million grins . newline newline it was around this time i got my last warning . there had been a huge uptick in the radio chatter since my arrival , i figured some last ditch attempt to finish a calibration run , but it really went crazy when one of my ships collided with a primitive space station . i didn  t suffer any damage , the thing just snapped apart and spread into pieces , but wow , did the amount of broadcasting explode after that . almost every unit down there was sending out signals on their hardware . newline newline that was it , really . the single moment that was a huge red flag . i blew right past it though , just like my ships dropping through the clouds . it was nearly a month before i realized i wasn  t fighting a brood . each of those little units was independent ! it  s total chaos as far as i  m concerned . newline newline seems to work for them though . i mean , i burned their cities to the ground , scattered the little guys to the ends ot the planet , and they just keep coming back ! they  re all different too . i mean one area keeps popping up with armored vehicles and planes , another keeps leaving bombs for my units to find , and another just waited for winter then bombed a couple of my divisions into a big crater . that  s just the ones that stand out . everywhere i go , i  m running into opposition , frightening , creative , explosive opposition . it  s incredibly hard for me to keep track of every front , and it leads to a lot of simultaneous headaches . newline newline none of it hurts as bad as those first streaks though . i was probably three quarters of the way through my landing when those little guys started nailing my ships in orbit with nuclear weapons . nukes ! can you even imagine that ? this world isn  t just packed with independent thinkers , they  re all insane nut jobs ! newline newline i mean sure , war is always a numbers game , but nukes ? i mean come on , they just obliterate some units and then you have a spot on the planet you can never visit . why would you do that when you could just throw a couple million units at someone ? i mean , even a billion wouldn  t be unreasonable . after a trade like that it would only take me a couple planetary orbits to get my numbers back up , but these little guys seem to have a death wish . they have stockpiles of the things ! newline newline anyway , my ships are gone . i salvaged a subwave transmitter , thus my message , and , uh , well actually this is a little embarrassing . i mean , i might even be the first to ask this , i certainly don  t know anyone else who has had to , but could one of you lend me a couple million hands with this planet ? newlinejournal , newline newline i still remember the first time . newline newline it was after christmas , and they had given him to me . i think it was the first time that i ve ever experienced something akin to happiness . i was forced to live out my deepest desires all this time in my head . use your imagination , doug . dad always thought he could help me that way  but i think he always knew it would end this way  which is why he brought me this gift . newline newline i had taken him apart and placed him in neat , little bags , which i tried to dispose of in some trash cans a few blocks down . that was the first time that skeeter found me  but he did nt find me out .  what are you doing in the trash , doug ?  newline newline  well  i wanted to make some music . i ve got this beat in my head , and i just got ta bang it out .  i picked up a metal rod on the ground near the refuse and struck the lid of the can . again , and again , i crafted a rhythmic beat . newline newline  bangin  on a trash can ?  skeeter asked ,  epic ! let me find an instrument !  and he ran off . newline newline i d have to find a better way . disposing of the body was always going to be

but try to stay awake ! make sure that mommy does too !  i turned toward the door and wrenched it open with more force than i meant to . newline newline newline  but daddy ... where are you going ?  the beautiful little girl rubbed sleep from her eyes , sitting up on the bed where my wife wrapped her in her arms . newline newline i froze in my tracks .  i m going to kill it .  newline newline newline  newline newline i did nt go far , of course . why should i , when it was right there beside me wherever i went ? a quick stop by the bathroom for a few sleeping pills was the only detour i needed . then it was to the master bedroom . i would need somewhere comfortable after all , if i was going to be out for half as long as i thought i would . newline newline newline  down the hatch .  i threw back my head , swallowing three or four of the little white capsules without water . then all i needed to do ... was wait . newline newline newline it was agony . images of my family ran through my head like a video set of fast forward . what if i did nt make it in time ? what if it got here first ? newline newline newline  faster , faster ... no !  newline newline newline i shook myself mentally . no point in worrying about what might happen . just got ta do what can be done and hope for the best . newline newline i concentrated through my mounting panic . easy ... easy .  i thought . i could feel the medicine kicking in , forcing my eyelids to droop despite the adrenaline coursing through my veins . in my mind , i held the image of a place that had often appeared behind my eyes unbidden in the past : the island of lost dreams . newline newline newline and then , with a feeling like the bottom had fallen out of my stomach , i was there . newline newline newline  newline newline newline selfpromotion time ! check out rtimesyncs for more of my work ! they turned down belmont boulevard . edward s dad glanced from the road to the mirror to adjust his yankees hat , then motioned toward the floor with a finger .  eddie , my man , throw in some heavy d. this ghetto makes me depressed.  newline newline eddie looked down for the cd pack , but was launched forward into the dash as his dad jammed on the brakes .  jesus christ ! look at this bitch . its nasty !  newline newline eddie sat up . a woman crossed the street in front of them with a pink leotard . she was walking on her tippy toes . eddie thought they called it  point  , or something just as unoriginal . it took forever for them to cross the street when they walked like that , and eddie noticed his dad was tightening his grip on the steering wheel . newline newline finally , the girl cleared the car , and eddie  s dad scrubbed out the old white lincoln .  that  ll teach em !  he pulled tight joint out of his shirt pocket , and sparked it up .  lets fish bowl this bitch !  newline eddie , rubbed his hands together . he loved it when they fish bowled the car . especially on the way to red lobster for sunday dinner . man , they were hella lucky to be so well off . he closed his eyes and let his head rest back against the seat . one more block and they were out of the ghetto . newline newline the car eased to a stop , the old lincoln  s brakes squeaking . eddie opened one eye , and saw the dangling red light over the intersection , and smiled . almost out . a car pulled up next to them with all the windows down . it was a prius , stuffed full of kids . oh , boy . here we go , eddie thought . they kids were staring over at them . eddie  s dad looked away and tucked his gold chain down under his shirt collar , then reached under his seat and pulled out his tecnine and laid it in his lap . newline newline the kid driving the prius had one of the new banana republic suits on , jet black . he reached down and turned the music up . eddie and his dad cringed . anything but that crap . nothing but sharp staccato screeches , and loud bangs . newline newline the light turned green and the kids drove off slow , and showed how uncultured they were by using a blinker to turn left . eddie  s dad shook his head . he put the gun back under his seat , then reached for the radio and turned the bass way up so that the car was vibrating as drove away from the ghetto , and all that horrible music . out the rearview mirror , eddie saw a girl with her hair pulled back tight , pirouette across the intersection . blah . newline newlineit was 1915 and we were in belgium . i d always wanted to visit belgium , but not like this  not in these trenches . here , but not now . newline newline believe it or not , living in stretching concaves in the earth with no personal space breeds a special sort of relationship among the inhabitants . funneled like rats  with rats  through these dark and sometimes cold trenches , morale was low . except for one man . newline newline that one man was named richard , and he seemed weary  but he always had a positive outlook on his situation . strange , considering death was almost certain in here  surely he knew that ? newline newline i remember sitting with him and asking him about his life back home  he apparently had a wife , but he seemed so young for it . he asked me if i had a girl back home , i told him i did nt . he just seemed indifferent , aside from a brief flicker of a frown . he told me i d find someone eventually . newline newline the one thing he said that stuck with me was , when asked if he planned to grow old with his wife , he looked me in the eye and said with a serene smile  i ve already done that  . newline newline there was something off with that man , but i had to admire his optimism . newline newline that night he disappeared , we never found a body  but there was no way he d leave . unless he simply got out of the trenches and started walking . surely he could nt do that ? surely . seven !  shouted meerg with excitement as the dice came to a stop . he was slightly overselling it . he tapped the piece around the board one square at a time , counting up from one to seven . newline newline he peered over at obama , still holding the piece on its destination . with a stern fixed gaze , he removed his hand slowly from the little metal shoe and paused , waiting intently for a reaction . newline newline obama owned the property , but obediently remained silent . casting a non confronting gaze toward the floor , feet slightly shuffling , he feigned a small cough and motioned that the turn had ended . newline newline meerg looked over at putin .  your turn !  newline newline putin stewed on a private thought for a moment , before slowly picking up the dice . his face hid an unhappy expression behind a layer of disciplined stoicism . not bothering to shake the dice , he released his fist and let them flop down with an uneventful tumble . newline newline  four !  newline newline  move your guy !  newline newline  a booming klaxon sounds in the distance  newline newline meerg looked upwards at the top of the basement stairs , startled only for the briefest moment before appearing annoyed at the interruption . newline newline  we re down here mom !  shouted meerg , hands over ears . newline newline  mooooomm  newline newline  we re down..  newline newline  the kalxon shuts off  newline newline the three captive leaders exchanged glances for a moment . meerg was silent , suspended in anticipation as he listened to the footsteps approach from upstairs . newline newline  what are you doing down there ?  newline newline meerg s mother was casting a long shadow down the basement staircase , her hands on hips . her tone and body language set an expectation for a satisfactory answer . newline newline  we re playing monopoly . i found it down here .  he declared , unapologetically .  humans keep all kinds of stuff in houses .  newline newline  meerg , these alarm systems are monitored . i had to pull a lot of strings to get these three here , you could at least not make me phone in a security check .  newline newline meerg with eyes rolled upward , silently mimed along his mother s words while making a stupid face . newline newline  meerg.. if you want to lead your own territory in the empire some day , you should learn a thing or two about politics .  newline newline meerg composed his expression and shouted back a reply .  talking to them in their holding room was depressing . this house is depressing . i hate it . how much longer does this stupid invasion go for ? why cant  newline newline  will you ever stop complaining ?  his mother was getting annoyed .  i think you d better get back on track , ok ? i want you back upstairs in ten minutes and i expect you finish your questions with these earth leaders  . newline newline she turned slightly , beginning to walk away , but paused . newline newline  and why do you insist on playing earth games ? why do nt you at least play something from our homeland ?  newline newline  i do nt know mom.. why do you sleep with earth men ?  newline newline meerg bit his lip . his face was painted with immediate regret . his eyes darted for a moment , his body frozen . newline newline meerg knew that his mother had formed a serious and meaningful relationship , strictly forbidden and potentially damaging to her military reputation . it was not a thing to joke about . newline newline the three earth leaders looked awkwardly aside . newline newline slightly squinting , meerg awaited the thunderstorm of a response he was surely due . he d overstepped . action before thought . even for him , this was bad . this was probably embarrassing and hurtful . brace for impact . newline newline meerg s mother slowly resumed her turn from the basement entrance , and walked away silently . newline newline  wait , i..  newline newline meerg launched from the table and ran upstairs . newline newline  mom wait..  newline newline his voice faded into the distance . newline newline  ..four , was it ?  putin picked up the tiny battleship from its square , and advanced it around the board .we were at about 15,000 feet with the doors wide open and moving at about 300 knots . and it was loud . newline newline still , it was nt so loud that i could nt hear the drop sergeant , yelling at us to line up and get ready to jump . i had heard she had been training recruits for years . regardless , like most of our instructors , it was clear she either enjoyed her job too much , or simply hated it a lot . it was always hard to tell . newline newline  this is it , recruits .  she yelled .  every one of you little shits is going to dive out the door . after three seconds of free fall you will open your wings . if not i will do it remotely  myself . to extract the wings all you need to do is move your arms out perpendicular to your shoulders . your suit will register your movements and the webbing will suddenly expand out from your hips , coming up to meet your hands . it will happen in less than a moment . these are not , i repeat are not like your typical civilian wingsuits you tried in aptitude training . the webbing will solidify almost instantaneously , and it will be rigid as fuck . once they solidify the slowdown will kick your ass , and hit you like a wall of bricks . when it does , catch your breath and take control . you have about 3 minutes of controlled diving to make it through as many of the rings as you can . the best score is 80 rings .  newline newline 80 rings ? that s every ring , i thought to myself . the last one is 500 feet off the ground . you can even see the drones holding it in place when you re down on the tarmac . the girl who did that must have been crazy  or indifferent about dying . either way , i was nt going to try and beat that record . i d always been told pilot training stopped being available for the boys because they were determined to outdo each other , and too many killed themselves in the process . plus , their strength was needed on the ground after we saw the results of the invasion s first phase . but even though male pilots were nt a thing anymore , it was clear that some of the girls before me clearly had some balls of their own as they went through flight training . but every fucking ring ?  not me . not today . newline newline it was right at that moment that the first girl in line jumped . i was fourth . newline newline she was immediately out of sight , down and to the right . at 300 knots there was no opportunity to see how the person before you had fared . she could have sideswiped the first ring and already be dead for all i knew . an extreme circumstance , sure , but it had happened before . usually you just got knocked out and your chute kicked in , but again , i d heard it had happened . newline newline then the next girl went . ten seconds passed . then the next girl went . newline newline then i was next . newline newline i walked up to the window and grabbed the handle right by the edge . looking down you could see that we were circling the ring network . eighty floating rings , each one about 10 feet in diameter . they were stacked miles high to create a semivertical course i would try to fly through . i d go for 60 , i figured . that d be enough . newline newline that s when i felt it . the drop sergeant s foot , square on my back . fuck ! i had been waiting too long  daydreaming before the jump . she had clearly gotten tired of my lollygagging . newline newline before i could think anymore she had extended her leg and kicked me clean out of cabin . suddenly i was falling . well , it sounds like a fun game but i m not sure i can win .  newline newline  shall we play , then ?  newline newline  sure , i ll give it a try ,  replied the girl . she stared back up at the stranger with the kind face . the game was strange  unlike any she had encountered before . in her few years of life she had grown to love games of cards , board games , charrades , and all sorts of others . but this , like the stranger in front of her , was different . newline newline her feet dangled on the seat as she took her place at the table . the stranger sat across from her and gave her a smile . something about him felt different , but it was difficult to put a finger on it . she thought , maybe its his accent ? or the way he s dressed ?  she shook her inquiries aside and brought her focus to the game in front of her . the stranger had explained the rules , and they seemed simple enough . the stranger made his move , and she countered with what seemed to be her best option . checks and challenges , scores and payouts followed . she was picking up the game quickly . newline newline  you re doing quite well ,  said the stranger as he made his move .  it s pretty rare to see someone pick up the game so fast  and at such a young age ! just how old are you ?  newline newline  i m twelve . and you had better pay more attention to the game or else i m going to beat you ,  she replied with a smile . her next move took him by surprise . newline newline she lost track of time as she danced across the board . this is starting to get fun . i might just win .  the stranger continued to make his moves with little more than an occasional compliment and a pleasant smile . newline newline the girl sat and stared at the board . she blinked , then took her piece and moved it into position . she hopped off her seat and exclaimed ,  aha ! i won !  newline newline the stranger stared at the board and realized she was right .  why yes , it appears you ve bested me . i m quite impressed . we ll have to play again sometime . let s shake hands .  newline newline she smiled and returned the gesture . newline newline           newline newline  she s got a pulse !  newline newline  oh my god .  newline newline almost forty minutes had passed . the lifeguard was exhausted from the swim and the compressions . he fell back and let the sweat dry off his body . newline newline  you saved my daughter ! you saved her !  cried the girl s mother . she hugged the lifeguard and then embraced her daughter . newline newline  sarah , sarah . you re okay , i ca nt believe you re okay ,  the mother sobbed . newline newline sarah blinked her eyes and looked at the crowd surrounding her . her chest ached and her whole body felt numb . newline newline the lifeguard gathered his words and spoke ,  we thought we lost you . how do you feel ? are you okay ?  newline newline  i feel fine ,  she said .  i won the game . i ve always been a man that sticks to his habits , so i did nt even think twice as i was on my knees licking away . everything felt natural at this point , the warmth , the juices dripping down my chin.. the familiarity was probably what made me enjoy it so much . without even thinking i started sliding fingers in , slowly at first.. just one.. two.. rubbing around the sides , making sure to get the spots my tongue could nt . i did nt even need to open my eyes to know when my job was done . leaning back , i asked my girlfriend if she enjoyed it .  it was delicious , but i hate the way you eat your spaghetti .  oh shit , i should not have gotten drunk at that party .  newline newline i could ve sworn that mixing mushrooms and four pints of hard liquor would have been a good idea . really , i did . but i did nt quite foresee the inclusion of a time travelling device . so when i finally fell down into the sands of jerusalem , i knew , i knew it was not a very practical place to be in my state of mind . newline but at the time , being beyond high and intensely drunk , i did nt realize i had warped through time and space . you know , timey wimey and all that . jesus and his apostles were proclaiming their higher love or something , and i thought it was amazing . honestly , i did . i grabbed a chair and sat , because this was a scene i d never forget . newline newline and while i knew i d never forget it , i also knew i was in some sort of state of mind that should nt be existent . following my trend of unfeasible acts , i mingled with the apostles and mr. jchristo himself . newline newline it was pretty fun . newline newline i took j man and his 12 or whatever friends out to party . b.c alcohol rules , if you ve never tried it . we got beyond hammered . it was quite a sight to see the man upstairs stumble around , and fall down stairs . followed by his apostles ? i was laughing so hard i thought i d die . newline newline but there was a moment i really thought i d die , like , out of some sort of movie  smiled into a thin layer of dust or something . i had dropped a pile of b.c time bricks onto jesus s head . the groans of a dying man were hard to stomach , but knowing it was coming from one of the most influential religious figures known in the entire history of the world was even harder to stomach . knowing i had just killed and subsequently stopped any production of the bible in 2015 was a bit surreal . newline newline however , it was then , as my ass was plunged into the time travel device , it was just then i had an idea . i would become the next jesus . i would be the man who died and , well , in this version of the bible , did nt come back in 3 days . the songs sung in the churches current day 2015 would be entirely different , the bible about 400 pages shorter , and there would be no 14th painting of jesus s life during the time he was executed . for i , just as i would be dead on the cross , would time travel away . newline newline and so , when no one was looking , i threw jesus s limp body into a river and threw on his clothes . his apostles at first were a bit suspicious . i managed to change their opinions . i showed them a simple magic trick , something you learn when you re in kindergarten . i removed my thumb and put it back . then , at that moment , i was praised to be jesus .  it was pretty cool .  newline newline i do nt really remember what happened , but we totally partied balls . it was insane . i led some goats or something and everyone referred to me as a total 16th prestige shepherd or something . newline newline eventually , i woke back at my home in eastern canada , present day 2015 . my girlfriend , pissed at me for being late for dinner with her parents , helped me dress in my hungover state . her parents , whom were extremely nice and wellmannered , were also extremely religious . curious , and , forgetting the previous night , i was flipping through their picture book bible . and , at the last page , there on the cross ... was me ? newline newline oh shit .today is the last day in the sunlight , for me . newline newline the locks are installed , thick curtains on the window , a high fence . the newspaper and food deliveries will be brought to the back door every morning . the trash will be moved from the door to the road , every thursday . newline newline i will never have to leave my house again , and i could nt be happier . newline newline i did nt use to be this way . newline newline three months ago , i came across an odd ad in the newspaper . newline newline want to know how you ll die ? newline i can paint it . newline newline it was accompanied by a phone number and an email address . newline newline it lacked style and originality , but my interest was piqued . i was skeptical , but the ad stuck with me . newline newline a few days later , bored beyond belief , i sent an email . i did nt receive a reply , but a few hours later , a younglooking man with a goatee showed up at my door with an easel , a canvas , and a set of paints . newline newline i had assumed it was all a joke , so the painter s arrival freaked me out . i asked him to leave , and tried to close the door , already prepared to call the police . newline newline he came by the next day and asked just to talk . i was still bored i ve been unemployed on disability for nearly 2 years now and quite lonely , so i invited him in and made him a cup of tea . newline newline  so , how does this all work ?  i asked , still skeptical . newline newline  i can tell the future the moment of your death but only through my painting ,  he explained .  i can not explain to you why . for  300 , i can paint the moment for you . once you have paid me , in cash , i will leave . i will never contact you again , and should you try to contact me , you will have no luck .  newline newline he seemed so ridiculously sketchy , crouched there in his hoodie with his deepset eyes surveying me below heavy life . newline newline however , boredom and loneliness will do strange things to a person , and i was at my most bored and loneliest . newline newline i decided to pay the money and have it done , just for fun . if nothing else , i could use the painting to cover the torn wallpaper in the upstairs guest room . newline newline i nodded my head , offered him some more tea , and helped him set up his drop cloth and easel in the dining room . newline newline i watched as he began to paint a deep cerulean here , a glimmer of green there , a few splashes of a velvety red . each stroke was so certain , so sure , that i could nt imagine he was making it up as he went along ! newline newline the first thing to form was a face a man s face , grizzled and worn , leering into the nothingness . he had squinty eyes , thin lips , and a chunky , squarish nose . newline newline the painter did the pupils last , and stepped back to admire his work for a moment and clean a brush . newline newline  where are his ears ?  i asked curiously , the man s face alien and empty without them . newline newline the painter turned to answer , but instead fell to the floor . i rushed forwards , held his wrist no pulse . newline newline i called 911 frantically , confused and on the verge of tears . newline newline they came , they took the body , they disclosed nothing , and they left . newline newline in the days to come , i left the easel as it was , a sort of shrine to painter . newline newline he was the only person other than me to enter my house in at least 8 months . newline newline the man in the painting continued to leer at me . newline newline i had a nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach that i was forgetting something . newline newline payment ? no , the money i would have paid the painter i had donated to a fund that provided art classes to children from lowincome families . newline newline but the feeling was there , still . newline newline about 4 days later , in the middle of the night , it hit me : the man in the painting was going to be a part of my death . newline newline i began to see the man s face everywhere his squinty eyes in the neighbor boy , his thin lips in the bank clerk , and his chunky , squarish nose in the bus driver . newline newline i had nightmares about him , daily panic attacks , and found myself checking over my shoulder when walking down the street . newline newline i began to make excuses to stay in . newline newline the dread of this man followed me everywhere . newline newline i stayed in more and more , and then began to fear that he would come to my house . newline newline so i bought locks , and a fence , and darker curtains . newline newline and now i m here , alone and hidden . perhaps lonelier , and just as bored , but alive . newline newline it s not that i enjoy life so much as i am terrified of death . newline newline but what s that ? a step on the porch ? newline newline nothing . newline newline a branch against the window ? newline newline no . newline newline every crack is frightening me , every change of light deepening the shadows . newline newline i creep through the house , checking every corner . but at the edge of the dining room , my foot catches on the drop cloth , twists , and pulls with me as i fall forward . newline newline the easel begins to fall , pinning me to the ground , and the painting staggers on top of me . newline newline i am face to face with the painting of the man now . i m trapped beneath the easel , no scheduled visitors , all phone lines cut in my attempt to seclude myself . newline newline i m bleeding out , i realize , from my temple . my head hit the doorframe as i fell , and now i can not move , and the man s face is staring into mine as i bleed ... . out ... . on the floor ... of my ... . newline newline but it was nt the man who would be present at my death . it was ... . the painting ... . of the man . hello john .  the well dressed man , standing there in his three piece suit , said . he looked almost sad as he stood over john in his hospital bed . newline newline  ah . you ve finally come .  john said , weakly . the years have taken a heavy toll on john . 85 years of live will do that to a man . newline newline  we ve spent much time together over the decades . only you were the one helping people finding their way . i wanted to thank you for that .  the well dressed man smiled while he spoke . newline newline  i did i needed to be done .  john said , he broke into a coughing fit . blood came up on his last hacking cough . newline newline  dear boy , what you ve done saved many . they will miss you .  the man in a suit spoke with a sad smile . newline newline john thought on his life for a moment . he was almost ready to go . he just needed to say good bye to his sons and daughter . he wanted to let them know how proud he was . he wanted one last kiss with his husband . newline newline  i m sorry john . you ve had 85 years . it s time to go .  newline newline  i m scared .  newline newline then they both were gone .sepuyakanajugu nashee newline newline  look , do nt hurt her , okay ? look , put me down and we ll talk about this !  newline newline the sangheili warrior dropped the doctor . as he brushed off the dust from his leather jacket , he got up onto his feet . he had a plan up his sleeve . multiple unggoys surrounded the tardis and attempted to open the doors , but could nt . they too were getting frustrated . they became super excited when they saw the tardis dematerialized in front of them . wanting to know its glory and potential , they demanded the doctor to speak of its nature . newline newline  nebuyich ?  newline newline  sorry , my sangheili is not so uptodate . though i ll admit a trip to sanghelios would make it better and to see its view , well how i would  newline newline the doctor was shoved to the ground by an already impatient sangheili leader . he grabbed the jackal s carbine and aimed it at the doctor s head . newline newline  nebuyich ! eik nata jeuikasula !  newline newline  hey ! i am not a human ! and i know what you re going to do with my time machine ! you re going to use it to end humanity  newline newline  i ve said too much have nt i ?  newline newline the sangheili warrior laughed . he flung the carbine and drew his energy sword . newline newline  ei sepukutabe naga hijotumusica  newline newline  no , please , do nt ! look , we can work this out !  newline newline as the sword was raised , gun fire opened up . human gun fire . the sangheili , knowing of the presence of the demon on requiem , ordered the phantom to fly away with the tardis on board . the warrior ordered his men to find him , amd as soon as they turned around , his guards and men were blasted by a rocket . the unggoy , in fear , looked for the demon . but when they found him , his green suit was the last thing they saw as the master chief opened fire at them . the jackals , in a phalanx formation , fired their pistols and needlers but the chief was too swift . he d flung a grenade and killed them off . in all the chaos , the doctor used his sonic screw driver to disable the warrior s shields . as the warrior roared in anger over his shields , the chief took the opportunity to stab a knife into its shoulder , then proceed to knock it onto the ground , dead . newline newline as he helped him up , the chief was confused on seeing another human on requiem . newline newline  my tardis ... it s gone .  newline newline  your what ?  newline newline  my tardis . the covenant took it . they saw me dematerialize in front of them and now they have it . if they find out how to use er they ll end humanity . all of it . you re the master chief

newline  and how do you know of her condition ?  followed the chief . newline newline  i m a time traveler . i know these things .  newline newline the doctor pulled out his hand . newline newline  your ai , please .  newline newline the chief pulled out cortana and handed it to him . the doctor repaired her . newline newline  now , no time to waste  said the doctor as he handed cortana back . he grabbed a storm rifle and pocketed two plasma grenades . newline newline  i m not too rusty back from my days of war .  newline newline  let s go  said he as the chief and the doctor ran towards the area the phantom flew towards .  i ll explain everything as we go .  newline newlinehe  s been staring my way for the past couple of songs , and every time i  ve made eye contact with him , he  s smiled back . he has a small figure and has kept his hands on his lap since he got here  rubbing them together . the nervous type , the type whose selfesteem has been shot down since childhood . his face is glistening with a thin mist of sweat that causes him to look like a human glow stick as the light changes to the beat of the music . newline newline i sway my hips to the last song in my set , experimenting with different rhythmspursuing an air of delicate sensuality and precise perfection . newline newline the next girl stands by the stairs , as i make it off the stage . her hand is on the rail as she sips the drink in the other one . she looks through me as i pass her . i slip into my top and dress and glance around at our clientele . there are a couple of groups here tonight , but they are all busied up with girls at a 2:1 ratio making a loss of time and thus money a very real risk that i am not willing to take today . it  s the end of the month and rent will be due soon . newline newline i glide over to the man with the fidgety hands . he looks awkward sitting alone with no drink in his handhe obviously hasn  t been sitting at the club for very long or else someone would have approached him already and politely suggested he should buy himself or a lady a drink . this is no place to loiter . newline newline i lean over , placing my hands on the arm rests of his chair .  hello , can i sit here ?  in a feminine voice , i gesture at his lap . newline newline  um , sure ,  he unclasps his hands and places them on the arm rests . i sit down on his body thighs and place an arm around his neck . newline newline  hi , i  m sasha . what is your name ?  newline newline  uh steve.  he looks away , the layer of sweat on his face thickening . newline newline  nice to meet you , steve . i feel kind of thirsty . would you like to buy me a drink ?  the first song is halfway done , but it seems i  m making good progress with this one . i try not to waste more than two or three songs per client because every one of those songs is a potential twenty dollars in my pocket . newline newline after a couple of drinks , he asks me if i would like to go into a private room with him . i only expected a dance , really , but with this he  s making my night and he doesn  t even know it . if i can get him in there for two hours , rent will be paid and i  ll have money left over . newline newline once in the room , i resume my spot on his lap , ad try to find a resemblance of my exboyfriend in himthe shape of his eyes ? his mouth ? his mouth might work . newline newline another girl walks in with an overpriced bottle a champagne and i reach out to pour myself a glass as she walks out . his hand trails down my shoulder and onto my back . it stops abruptly at the middle of my back and he moves my hair aside . newline newline  what is this ? it looks like  he gasps . newline newline  it  s nothing ,  i breath , pulling my shoulder back . i turn to him and force a smile .  sasha what is that on your back ?  he asks raising his voice .  would you like some champagne ? you can have my glass . i  ll just pour myself another glass.  i try to pull away but his fingers are digging into my shoulder now .  i  ve seen that mark before ! don  t you know what it is ? what it means ?  his hand rattles me . newline newline  yes , i  ve heard of it . you  ve got the wrong person , steve . it  s ok , you  re safe here with me . i don  t have any magical powers of any kind  i  m not the chosen one  i  m not in any way special ,  i try to look over my shoulder but that just causes him to squeeze my shoulder tighter . i cringe but feel that it would not be wise to express my pain to him . newline newline  calm down ,  i add . his breath is shallow  i think he might be hyperventilating . newline newline i turn back to the bottle of champagne and find that i can still reach it , so i start pouring him a glass . i feel a sharp pain on my shoulder and drop the

bigger the wound , the more severe the pain . but i don  t feel anything as i raise my hands to shield my face  unable to speak from the shock , unable to call for help . i am deserted with steve , whose real name i will never know . he looks confident now , sure of his decision and full of purpose . his hand is warm on my neck and as i close my eyes i can feel my chest being crushed .in the

know why we are walking in the forest at 4 am on a tuesday . but , that s what we decided to do . nathaniel is up in front , leading the way . my boyfriend , phillip , is right next to me . he grabs my hand and pulls me close . i look into his eyes as he looks into mine . everything seemed great . nathaniel had stopped walking because he had to piss . he goes behind a tree and you can head the zip of his pants zipper . i look straight at phillip . our foreheads pressed together , his arms around my waist , and he s smiling . at the same time , we both lean in for a kiss . as our lips touch , we hear a snap of a tree branch . newline phillip pulls away from the kiss and looks around . he looks back at me and presses his index finger against his lips . he walks towards the tree where nathaniel stopped to pee . the flashlight is still on . phillip just stops dead in his tracks . i see his eyes water . confused , i peek around the tree . newline it s nathaniel . newline face down on a pile of leaves . blood splattered everywhere . to his right , a stick covered in blood lays . i start to cry . i try to walk away to go back to the house . but phillip would nt budge . i tried jerking on his arm . it did nt work . i look at him and as i m about to say a word ... he points outward . i m again confused . i look at where he is pointing . newline newline it s another nathaniel . and he s alive . holding a stick . smiling . his smile is covered with blood . he walks towards us . all i hear is crunch , crunch , crunch of the leaves underneath his feet . we try to run . we are running after than we ever could . suddenly i fall to the ground . phillip stops running and turns around to help me up . but it s too late . newline nathaniel is over top of me . smiling . he lifts the stick up and slams it down onto my chest . newline i hear nothing but a scream . newline i wake up in my bed . phillip and nathaniel run into the room , thinking i ve been attacked by a burglar . i m sweating and panting . i ve never been so scared . i look at the clock . it reads 4:00 am . killing of jfk , 1963  get the interference out of control i hear in the walkietalkie . ever since the illuminati took over the government , i ve been working for them . then this kennedy kid comes in and messes up the plan . this could severely damage our russian branch , you know . lho is in , sir . get up high , they wo nt see you up the endless stairs , up and up . i stop . the rifle is in my hand . this could save the plan ! fire .  and then the screams . it was a blur of secret servicemen and regular civilians trying to figure out what happened . great job . this means a pay raise . 70 minutes later i need to get low . they ve caught my track . if only i can get acro  the weapon clatters and spins , filling the air with a pure metallic ring . as i watch the weapon glide gracefully towards me , i am suddenly overwhelmed by a soulshaking roar that forced all of my hair to rise in unison . newline newline as i peel my eyes away from the sword , i notice a figure charging towards me with thundering steps . my breaths tremble and race and my mind flashes red as i snatch up the sword near my feet . newline newline a flash of steel , a harsh woosh , and a piercing clash . my assailant narrowly misses me as i dash away to create some distance . the man readies his sword , his rippling muscles effortlessly guiding his sword into a slow dance . newline newline he was a mountain of a man : his muscles bulged and threatened to rip his clothing apart . he sported a magnificent beard underneath the plain mask that concealed most of his face . newline newline he lets out a roar and charges again . his charge seems simple  almost amateur , but strangely familiar . he swings in a colossal arc into my block . my bones creak and my muscles cry , barely holding my body together under the shattering force of the blow . my right leg betrays me and my right knee rushes to the ground , my sword barely maintaining my balance . newline newline the man swings again at an impossible speed towards my torso . i force myself to block , dodge , anything at this point , but my body refuses to listen . the sword weaves through me and out the other side with seemingly no resistance at all . newline newline still i kneel , bewildered . i feel no pain . looking downwards , it seems like the sword has indeed met no resistance at all  my clothes , arms , body , all perfectly intact . newline newline perhaps i was still recovering from the initial shock of being thrust into this world , or by the assailant , but i just started to notice a group of four standing in the distance , just trembling . newline newline then a sound hits me . i turn towards the source and find my assailant thrashing on the ground , struggling to get the mask off . newline newline  your face , oh man , your face !  he writhes in laughter , finally managing to peel away the mask . newline newline  tyler ?  i shout in disbelief ,  what the fuck ?  newline newline tyler tries to comprise himself , unsuccessfully , as he manages to squeeze out ,  it was adam s idea .  newline newline i turn around towards the group of four just as adam starts shouting . newline newline  how d you like your viking trial , steve ? fancying a little valhalla now are we ?  newline newline with adam stood john , kevin , and david , their smug faces bright red from holding in their laughter . the last time we ve all been together was in the winter of 2008 , at the bowling alley up on 3rd street . before david decided to have a heart attack in 2009 and leave us all behind . newline newline  okay now calm down mr . idlikeavikingfuneral ,  adam chortled whilst wiping away his tears ,  let s go grab some beers for our new valhalla resident .  newline newline  after i beat the shit out of you !  i shouted as i started to chase adam s fleeing figure , before turning around to my supposed friends ,  you fuckers are next ! aloysius reemus the bear  his given name  pranced through the oakwood state forest with a sense of urgency and determination the likes of which he had never known . why prance at such a pace , you might ask ? you see , stumpy , aloysius  s tree stump friend , was in a whole mess of trouble , and it was up to aloysius to help out his trunkless pal . it may sound odd to you that a grizzly bear would make friends with a tree stump , and to that i say ,  friend , you ain  t heard nothing yet . but , to answer your question , aloysius didn  t have any bear friendsheck , he didn  t have any friends . one day , while aloysius sobbed alone in the forest , a chatty tree stump tried to cheer aloysius up . it turns out , that tree stump was a mighty nice stump , and stumpy and aloysius became the best of friends.  newline newline up on yonder oaktree mountain , where the sunlight dare night try pass through the thick green leaves , stumpy lived , but where the sunlight shied away , a godless construction crew toiled to blast and dig up everything and anything that was in the way of its newly planned corporate getaway lodge  a beautiful sight to behold on a set of blueprints , and , frankly , a potentially lovely retreat for you and your corporate drones . call for a reservation if aloysius doesn  t make it through this adventure . newline newline aloysius reemus was nearly halfway up the mountain when he came upon a group of hunters . you  d probably agree that here  s a time and a place for tangling with a bunch of rifletoting hunters , and now wasn  t that time . maybe next week . definitely not now . newline newline  excuse me , gents ,  aloysius gummed out of his toothless mouth ,  but i don  t have time to be hunted . you see , my friend is in terrible trouble.  newline newline  holy crap ,  a mustachioed hunter said , raising his rifle ,  a talking bear ! get him ! we  ll be rich !  newline newline now , i should probably mention here that in addition to talking , prancing , being toothless , and friends with a tree stump , aloysius reemus the bear can also spontaneously explode , then magically put himself back together . in fact , aloysius loves to explode . so he exploded right there in the midst of those surprised hunters . newline newline baboom ! newline newline aloysius giggled as his bear body put itself back together . he didn  t have time to dwell on the crater that used to be a group of hunters , for he had a stump to save ! and away aloysius went into the deep , dark forest . things were just swell for a whileupwards of hundred yards , if i had to guessuntil aloysius came upon the oakwood mountain pixies , a dastardly bunch of winged humanoids that relished in throwing pixie dust into a person  s eyes , but , more importantly , selling portions of the forest to construction companies for development . newline newline  halt !  beatrix pixie called to aloysius . she was not a good mood , for some reason .  take your toothless mouth home , aloysius . leave the construction company be . they  re going to make a fantastic corporate getaway lodge , and you can  t stop themstumpy be damned ! you may call the following number for a reservation : 190081   newline newline baboom ! newline newline did i mention aloysius reemus the bear loved to explode ? well , he did it again , blasting those pesky pixies into the forest canopy and out of aloysius  s way . he had a tree stump to save ! the toothless bear pranced onward until the grumble of mighty machines shook the forest floor . yellow construction trucks barged through the ancient trees , while helmetclad workers scurried like spiders , collecting debris , and placing blasting charges around tree stumps . wouldn  t you know it ? one of those stumps outfitted with stateoftheart blasting caps was ol  stumpy himself . newline newline  heya , aloysius !  stumpy called from behind a group of construction workers . the workers had long since come to terms with the talking stump , and chose to ignore him . newline newline  hi , stumpy !  aloysius answered .  i  m here to save you ! sorry i  m late . i got to exploding again , and you know how i can get.  newline newline  boy , do i , ol  pal . hurry , please ! they  re about to explode me , and i don  t like it . no offense.  newline newline  none taken , stumpypalofmine.  newline newline  stop right there , you toothless , exploding bear !  a voice bellowed . aloysius turned to find a slick man in a suit scowling at aloysius : he was c.e.o . of corporate getaway inc.  the pixies sold us this land fair and square , bear . leave us be , for we  re just honest construction folk , and we  re going to blow your stump friend out of the ground whether you like it or not.  newline newline honestly ? aloysius didn  t much like the fact that stumpy was going to get blown out of the ground , so aloysius decided to do something about it . he was going to blow these construction workers sky high . newline newline baboom ! newline newline aloysius reemus the bear was not a perfect bearhis lack of teeth could certainly point you toward that answer . specifically , though , aloysius failed to think things through , especially when it came to exploding . so it came as a surprise to aloysius when his bear bits rebuilt his bear body that he had accidentally blown stumpy to kingdom come . his best friend , the stump of his life , was now just a collection of wood on the forest floor . aloysius was a sad bear once again . the goodintentioned bear sobbed into his mighty bear paws and cursed his love for exploding . newline newline  i  m sorry for your loss ,  the foreman said , his body covered in stump debris and singed from the aloysius blast .  perhaps you two can be reunited again.  newline newline  could we ?  aloysius asked , the foreman drying his bear eyes .  how ?  newline newline time passed , as time usually doessix months to be exact . the corporate getaway lodge opened ontime and under budget , with reservations locked up for almost a year . the lodge would truly be beacon of hope and money in whichever state it was located in for years to come . be sure to book a reservation for your corporate retreat , and make your offsite teambonding a truly memorable one . and don  t forget to say hello the chatty stump coffee table , and the toothless bearskin rug in the main foyer . they were once best friends and enjoy pleasant conversation . call 1900814555 to make your reservation today .

great time here in minionsidekick academy . thanks .if i was being honest with myself , 58 was goddamn long enough . the last two in the nursing home , they were extra rough . and the six weeks in hospice , jesus . and sure , cancer s a shit way to go , but there s no point in being a coward about it . newline newline but in the scope of the whole 58 , the cancer was nt even that big of a deal . it hurts a bit , but at least you get some drugs . and it only took 3 years , not a bad shake to how it could have been . virginia had it worse , what with the drink . she was a good woman but burying our son was too much and well , that s how it goes . the worst was angela though . no man should ever have to see that happen to his own daughter , i dont care what he done . despicable . newline newline but either way , i d had quite enough , so when i finally heard that punk ass doctor  what was he , 35 ? ridiculous  announce me dead , i was on board . newline newline but lo and goddamn behold , i show up at some stupid gates . just what i need , a friggin encore . i thought this was all supposed to be halfcocked hocus pocus , but damn if there ai nt some fat old dipshit

my time . read me my sins or whatever and get me outta this dump .  newline newline bastard looked surprised , felt good to know i still had it . newline newline  if you insist . newline newline your

newline two for profanity , parental abuse for a term no greater than two years in length newline newline three for idolatry ,  and on he goes . the list was long , to be sure . newline newline as he droned out my received punishment , it took longer than i was proud of to piece it together . i mean , it had been a hell of a life , but i had made it out . it s what my old man told me , when i

angela . i had nt ever been able to talk about it since it happened , but i had to know why . i had to know what i did that some almighty jagoff had made me watch it happen to her . i had a lifetime

newline oh shit , i forgot . i had been in hell . he had to make hell in the first place , just for me . newline newline i started to remember what i did . i remembered how i had tried to burn his golden throne , dragged darkness into his courts of never ending light , how i had gathered as many of my brothers and sisters as were unafraid and we had risen up , to cast him down , return him to his place . i was blinded by righteous indignation , impatient , because i could not believe what he had done . newline newline he had thrown them from the garden . he gave them temptation and filled them with curiosity , he made them to disobey him and punished them for it . he made them precious and mortal and discarded them . it was unjust , and as his second , i had to make it right . newline newline but i had hesitated , sword of flame upon his heart , i could not destroy my creator , despite his failing . and he had trapped me in hell , to break my rebellious spirit . newline newline but hardness , that s what nobody ca nt ever take from you . newline newline  thanks be unto you peter , long have i suffered for this redemption or whatever .  newline newline  you may enter the gates , morningstar . all debts paid .  newline newline  yeah buddy , all but this last one . and i think at this point , you start calling me dragon . dear samantha , newline newline sometimes , i do nt know what to write in these letters . the passionate declarations of love , the certainty that this war can not keep us apart forever , the things i wrote over and over hunched by my bed . can i say any of that now ? do i want to ? honestly , samantha , i could die before either of us even notice . a stray bullet on a tuesday , a silent bomb shell on a wednesday , god knows what on a friday and no matter how it will happen i ca nt stop it . newline newline love , no matter how strong it is as an emotion , ca nt stop bullets . it ca nt heal any physical wounds . i still love you , too much to lie to you , too much to say i m coming back from this damn war . even now i can hear the cries of dying men , a wail which all too soon will escape from my own mouth . a wail which now seems all too familiar . newline newline although love can not lie , it must conceal . i can not write to you of the screams of men , lest they haunt your sleep too . i can not write to you of the suffering i have seen , i have caused , lest you turn away in disgust . one thing i ve learned in war is that things are never as they seem , and rarely should be . newline newline a final farewell , newline newline lieutenant alexander rigby i m still not sure i understand ,  i said slowly . newline newline the devil rolled her eyes .  it s pretty simple , jack ,  she purred into my ear .  high stakes poker . whichever of us wins gets the other s immortal soul .  newline newline  that s the thing , though ,  i said , gently pushing the gorgeous woman away .  what does having someone else s soul actually mean ? also , you have a soul ?  newline newline she smirked .  honey , i used to be an angel . i ve still got the looks , do nt you agree ?  she gave a slow turn , showing off all angles of her delicious body .  and angels are nothing but soul .  newline newline  that still does nt answer the question .  newline newline the devil laughed , throwing back her head to expose a lovely neck .  you re a sharp one , are nt you jack ?  then she sobered up .  a soul is essentially power . it fuels everything you do . some people naturally have more of it than others  newline newline  black musicians ?  i asked dryly . newline newline she gave a brilliant smile .  something like that . those with more soul naturally have more success at everything they do . it does nt guarantee it , and it s no substitute for hard work . but a little soul goes a long way .  newline newline i thought for a moment .  how do i know you re telling the truth ?  newline newline  as i said , jack , i was an angel ,  the devil said patiently .  angels ca nt lie . oh , i can mislead you , trick you , give halftruths and not leave out information . but i ca nt lie .  another laugh .  prince of lies indeed . so many things wrong with that , would nt you agree ?  she cupped her breasts , mocking whoever had come up with the title . newline newline  so if you get my soul , that adds to your own abilities ,  i guessed .  and if i get yours ...  newline newline  well , that s what souls do for mortals ,  the devil clarified .  they work a little differently for us immortals .  newline newline  if i get yours ?  newline newline she was totally serious now .  if you got my soul , your new , larger soul would burn through your puny mortal body and leave you an immortal . you would become a creature as powerful as me , and archangel , but with no ties to either heaven or hell . with that power and the unconstrained freedom that comes with being human , you d be even stronger than our father .  newline newline god , i assumed .  so why the hell would you risk this ?  newline newline the devil gave ... well , a devilish grin .  if i win , i get what i want . if i lose , i tick of dear old dad . it s a winwin for me , really .  she tilted her head .  not for you though .  newline newline  have you ever done this before ?  i asked . newline newline  more times than your heart has beat , jack . and i m still here .  newline newline i weighed the risks , then made a decision . newline newline   newline newline i said i would nt , but i did .  here s the sequel .   https :

problems began when he was 13 years old . like any small boy in wichita , kansas he lived life in a bubble . first grade , second grade , sixth grade the same tests with the same kids in the same school , all since he was 6 years old . saturday was for video games and television and sunday was for church . he had had the same schedule for the last 3 years straight : right home from school , finish that schoolwork , dinner and then maybe some tv or internet before bed . the routine never varied  there was no after school sports or clubs or activities for him , his parents just would nt allow it . by the time he was 10 billy started to feel different . no one around him noticed , no one around him cared . he had no friends , and that s why the first crack in the seam of billy s life went completely unnoticed . it began one day  saturday , in fact  when he was playing world of warcraft . in the middle of a melee he suddenly blurted out , no one else in earshot   asldfkasdfadf  .  asdfvpoib , erspobeps adfpgjr dsf sdpbspba  . words that he d never said pored from his mouth ... from no where . more and more gibberish his babble became a landslide of  well ... sentences .  adsfalskd alskdfa13oi4    oifhoi siieureoi , isgfdogihsf  . none of it made any sense , but he knew what he was saying , and he could nt stop himself . on and on he went until eventually , that night , billy had dinner with his parents . it was right between bites of potato that he introduced his parents , unintentionally , to this new language . at first they scolded , then pleaded then threatened , all to no avail . because this was the beginning of the end , because billy s support system was nonexistent . that support system , starting with his parents , and ending with his friends  none could help , and slowly billy felt nonexistent . newline martha and tom had had billy late in life and were unprepared for the day to day expense of having any child , even newline one as  uneventful as billy . while there was little to no drama in their life , these were not parents to put up with babble . so when this language came , seemingly from nowhere , they tried to put a stop to it . they tried pleading with billy to stop . they tried bribing him to stop . and they tried punishing him , to compel him to stop , but days turned to weeks and weeks to month , and billy s language only became more vocal , and more refined . he knew what he was saying , but no one else did . his parents were beginning to think about committing billy to an institution . newline the east witchita school system was an old and established organization , with a kind of institutional muscle newline memory  that knew what to do with troublesome kids . and in that one day in december bill mcquarrie became one of those kids . he was nt violent , or even particularly unruly , but he was incapable of learning anything new . instead he simply processed his understanding in a language no one had ever heard of . he seemed smart enough , but the school had no way to test him . this went on for a few months , but in the end billy was relegated to a special school where he could have more one on one  time with his teachers , with the added convenience of the short bus to school every day . newline other kids had never really cared for billy the way kids ordinarily do , with that kind of magnetic pull that binds two newline opposite poles together . while they all knew he was there , maybe even felt sorry for him , it was nt enough for anyone to take that extra step and sit next to him at lunch . the closest he had to a friend was tess mcgill , but she had only talked to him on a dare from one of her friends , and desperate as we was , billy was nt going to try and make friends under those conditions . so , when he started babbling to himself  one day on the way to homeroom  no one really noticed , or cared . newline suddenly , the world seemed to have bigger problems , and as insignificant as billy was before , it was nothing compared to now . he d read online that a meteor had crashed into earth on the eastern seaboard and scientists had told newline the world that there were aliens . that s right , real , live extraterrestrials that were walking and talking . and there was even a youtube video of them . almost as soon as it went up , youtube crashed with the sheer number of page requests . but with persistence , billy was able to load the video , and he was stunned to see the grainy cell phone image of the aliens . halfway through the video billy heard people shouting  it sounded like the military , some kind of commander .  can anyone understand us ?  , the voice shouted . newline billy looked at the video strangely ,  why would the army ask if anyone could understand them ?  newline  what planet are we on ?  , asked the video . stunned , billy realized what was happening . newline he could understand what the aliens were saying , they were speaking in his language . billy knew that he had to go to the alien landing site and see them with his own eyes : maybe even talk to them . newline billy told his parents , he showed them the video and told them what the aliens were saying , what they were asking . but they did nt believe . they were planning to send him away . before he might not have cared , but now , he had to get to the alien site . even though he was a kid . even though he was nt supposed to know better , billy ran away to the alien site . taking every dollar he had saved , what he was going to use for the prom , like he d ever go , he thought . using that money , he bought a bus ticket to new york , and wondered how long it would take for his parents to find he was gone . newline it did nt take long to get to find the alien site once he got to new york , something unusual happened as soon as he stepped of the bus . almost , telepathically , a voice guided him through the streets , to an abandoned upper east side building . it was an old brownstone that looked like a hundred others , and was built a century ago . the voice told him to climb the stone steps and open the front door . newline newline  newline newline as the aliens prepared to depart , billy continued to plead  take me with you  , he begged , speaking alien . newline  no one here understands me like you do , no one cares like you do . i have no life on this planet and once you leave i ll have no one to talk to  . newline so the aliens took billy . newline rebecca house , can you tell us why you are found at the crime scene with your dead children and husband when you claimed to be out shopping ?  newline newline the inspector maintained his stoic and unbroken gaze at rebecca . in response she smiled . newline newline  well , i was out shopping . but i told you before , i came back and killed them .  newline newline the inspector frowned , then interrupted newline newline  this is no place for games , this is a serious criminal investigation . we will achieve your full corporation .  newline newline rebecca laughed . newline newline  i killed them . quickly of course . i made my husband suffer , he deserved it . the kids were nt totally evil . in any case , i could nt have them growing up in an environment as hostile as the one i lived in . i ve been down here many times before , but its not like you believed me when i told you about the situation .  newline newline the inspector looked threatened briefly . newline newline  i told you , there was no physical evidence of harm . i could nt do much , and in any case , bobby house is a good man . i know ... knew him personally . he would nt hurt a fly .  newline newline rebecca retorted . newline newline  he d hurt an innocent house wife though . tell me , do you know what bleach tastes like ?  newline newline the inspector did nt answer . newline newline  for fifteen fucking years he beat me , raped me , made me swallow things i should nt . he even

but when the law fails me , i become a practical woman . do you understand that inspector ? a practical woman .  newline newline the inspector stood up , and produced a taser from his uniform .

never thought he would make time for me . newline but he did . newline i never thought he d love me enough to have a child with me . newline but he did . newline i never thought he d say the words ,  please do nt  newline but he did . newline i never thought he d love me enough to die for me . newline but he did . micheal .  newline newline  what is it ?  newline newline the two figures were hunched over a suitcase in a quiet warehouse down near the docks . outside it was midnight and the ships were nt due for another few hours . in here the time did nt matter and men with guns were coming for micheal and his intern . newline newline  i hear guns .  newline newline  i m taking that under advisement . looks like he s got an offshore account .  newline newline  i do nt think that s important right now .  newline newline micheal shook his head . typical for jimmy to miss the point . the man had an offshore account and kept all the information at a dock yard . there was clearly something fishy going on . fishy like the the contents of all these crates clearly marked  fish .  newline he dove deeper into the accounts . numbers present themselves in neat , orderly rows . he saw them streaming by , pointing out the errors . newline jimmy tugged nervously on micheal s sleeve but the accountant did nt feel it . he was lost in the midst of the accounts . newline newline a few days ago tony geppetto had come to mike and asked for some help with his books . there was a federal investigation , he explained , and he needed some numbers legitimised . otherwise , and micheal remembered the threat very clearly , he d end up  sleeping with the fishes .  newline newline fish . like the ones in the crates . newline newline like in the accountants . newline newline offshore . newline newline fish as in fishbeign , micheal s own surname . newline newline something was going on . newline newline he turned a page , following the money just like he had followed it to this warehouse . there had to be an easier way to make a living than this , but mike could nt think of one that would be more fun . newline newline  mr . fishbeign !  came the voice . jimmy whimpered a bit , but it did nt matter . mike had just worked it all out . he stood and straightened his tie . newline newline  tony . i believe i ve cracked your accounts .  newline newline  i did nt ask you to go off script on me . i asked you to cook the books i gave you .  newline newline  but i ve worked it all out . the feds are looking for your money , right ? and i know just where to hide it .  newline newline say what you will about micheal fishbeign . accuse him of breaking into your warehouse , point guns at him , once he s on a job there s no stopping the rogue accountant . newline newline  newline just a quick story i ve thrown together on my phone . i love the idea of an accountant who s a force of nature , dim witted when it comes to everything but numbers . hope you enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed the prompt . lucy s progress has been remarkable , mr. solomon and mr. saul . since the first quarter , i was nt sure her comprehension of mathematics was up to our level , but evidently , i see she has been able to progress faster than any other student . i trust that you have been helping her , yes ?  newline newline ms. sykes simply looked at me . i think she hates me , but i m not sure . she constantly treats me differently from everyone else . kind of like everyone else is better than me and i m just okay when compared to them . i got better at math , i studied every day , i did all my homework and classwork and even won the mini competition my grade had . but ms. sykes gave the candy bar reward to tomas , and he got second place . i got nothing . instead i was told  just know there are people better than you .  and then other kids started to chant the same thing until she started to teach history . newline newline pa and dad said that i did my best and how they checked everything . they said how they were moving away from checking my work . then they told me to close my ears , so i did . i heard them anyway , i do nt know how . they said they were still checking my work even when they did nt when i asked them to . she does nt like me at all . then dad motioned to me to close my ears tighter . newline newline then pa got mad . he said i got ds and cs in all my subjects . and then he said how he checked all my work and how i got everything right . he rarely got angry , but when he got angry , it got stuffy and too hot wherever he was . he said he wanted to see my class folder . so ms. sykes got up and looked for it , and then said she lost it . newline newline pa told her how she was a liar . dad told pa how we ca nt make any assumptions , but that folders do nt get lost just because . dad s voice was soft . i love both my pa and dad even though they are very different . i guess they loved each other enough to have me . pa always makes a devil food cake every few weeks , and dad makes an angel food cake every few weeks too . they wear different clothes . pa wears work shirts and dress pants all the time , but dad wears light cotton shirts and jeans . pa has some beard on his face and is fuzzy , but dad has no beard . his face is smooth . newline newline anyway , pa got angry . he got up and found my folder . ms. sykes looked scared . she kept trying to tell him only teachers could take folders . but pa told her to try him . i do nt know what that meant . and then he got quiet . he told me to come over , and showed me my work . they all had 89 to 100 on them , but fs and ds written on all of them . i did nt know ms. sykes hated me that much . i wanted to cry but dad told me to not to cry and hugged me . newline newline then pa and dad took me and ms. sykes to mr. hill , the school principal . they talked to him , showing my homework , and then said they wanted something done about ms. sykes . she looked scared . she did nt like it and stared at me . i remember she said how there are people smarter than me . and then i told dad how she said that . i asked him if that was okay for teachers to say . dad did nt like and and said how it was nt nice to say that to kids . mr. hill told us how he will do something about it . so we left . when we came home , i petted kitty and we had angel food cake . pa said how i was smart and caring and how teachers should nt say mean things to people who are a bit different . i asked if i was different , but he told me i was different in a good way . i asked if i was a good student and he said he was proud . i guess i did okay . i wonder who my new teacher will be .i was led to the entrance of the cave where the young couple lived , carved into a hillside near a river . they were two carefree young peoplehippie types , perhaps in their early thirties . they were not much older than me , really ! newline newline the entrance passageway was constructed of natural orangebrown rock , sloping steeply downwards and then breaking into into a set of about 5 steps placed at a ridiculous forward angle . the end of the passageway was solid rock and the actual entrance was on the left . newline newline i felt myself stumbling slightly on the lose stones that were strewn across the entrance floor , trying to grab onto something to stop myself from falling .  would you like us to extend the ladder ?  she asked cheerfully .  ladder ? what on earth is there a ladder for ?  i thought . the slope of the passageway was steep , sure , but it was still more horizontal than vertical , and a ladder seemed ridiculous ! newline newline i declined the ladder , but by this stage she had already pressed the button on her remote anyway , and a wooden ladder on a rope pulley slid toward me on my left . as it turned out , it was nt a ladder along the floor of the passageway , but more of a makeshift banister that i could grab on to to steady myself ! or so it would have been , had i not now reached the top of the treacherous stairs , where annoyingly , the  ladder  stopped . i put my arms out like a tight rope walker , and carefully traversed the steep angle of the stone steps , egged on by the hippie couple with so many words of encouragement . they were already down you see  in fact they d been down the entire time ! apparently , getting into this ridiculous place was second nature to them ! newline newline by now i was leaning forward and struggling to contain the force of gravity pulling me down . i leaped over the last obstacle and had to slow my running motion from the momentum . the hippie couple clapped and cheered at me in a rather patronizing way  the way you congratulate a child for achieving something for the first time . i was nt impressed . newline newline they led me into their home through the entrance on the left . inside was a mixture of dated , unassuming pine furniture , like a dining table with two chairs , some shelves , and then a basic kitchenette with a little breakfast bar carved out of the rock . the kitchenette stopped at a wall on it s far end , but the wall did nt extended to the other side of the cave , rather leading to another passageway which had what i assumed to be the master bedroom at the end of it . the place had no flooring to speak of , just the dusty ground  and the walls and ceiling were just the uneven , bare rock with the occasional picture frame , and number of shelves attached to the rock walls . but what the place lacked in terms of carpets or paint , it made up for in the little trinkets that they had presumably took home from their travels all over the world . newline newline i picked one up off the shelf . it was a blue skull , formed out of some sort of plastic mesh  so it was not completely solid , even a little fragile looking . the mesh design was uneven and created a series of intricate , repeating patterns that made it look rather beautiful .  do you like it ?  he asked .  we got it on our trip to mexico ! they were celebrating a local custom called the day of the dead , where they honor their close friends and relatives who have died ! they were selling these at the market !   yyeah , it s very cool !  i said shyly .  tea ?  she asked .  oh.. erm.. yes please !  they both did nt say anything more to me while i explored the room . despite all this ruggedness , i was starting to feel a cozy sense of home in this place ! newline newline now , i should point out that i do nt actually know these people . i ve never met them before today , and i do nt even recall how i became acquainted with them , or why i was invited to their place . the whole thing seemed a little surreal , and the thought that it might be a dream cropped up in my mind ! but dreams are illogical , they do nt follow a coherent story  they tend to change and morph and jump around . this whole sequence of events , while strange indeed , still followed a logical , linear story . besides , you can control what people say in your dreams , and i could nt control what they said to me or to each other . every now and then they would talk to each other in another language , and i could nt influence when they spoke or what they said , with my mind . i could nt influence anything that happened at all , and that s why i concluded that it could nt possibly be a dream .  either that , or i m just a really crappy lucid dreamer !  newline newline i turned away from the shelves and found what should really have been the elephant in the room all this time . in the middle of the room , taking center stage even over the dining room table , was an old victorian style , child s bed . it was steel framed , with the freshly made duvet covered in bright patterns of flowers and fairies , and other girly things ! i had noticed it before , but now it had my undivided attention ! why was there a bed in the middle of the room ? and where was the child ?  who s bed is this ?  i asked . the young woman turned from the kettle and walked over .  oh , that s the bed of our late daughter ...   oh my god i m so sorry !  i interjected .  that must be terrible !   we keep it here in her memory.  she continued , before smiling sweetly and turning away to carry on with the tea . now , i know it s rude to ask , but my curiosity had simply got the better of me :  ddo mind if i ask how it happened ?  i said nervously .  of course not , dear !  the couple were both standing together now , their faces had changed from the happy and bubbly expressions of youthful naivety that i had become accustomed to , to the deep pain and grief , perhaps with a tint of regret . they both bowed their heads slightly   well to be honest , the whole thing was sort of our fault ...  newline newline  it s a repost of some i did earlier but did nt get any attention for ...  what do you mean no  ?  the man asked the elderly toy maker on his bench . the older man simply shook his head in response , too caught up in creating his next invention : a wooden toy soldier . he was still putting on the finishing touches , slowly and carefully hand painting the last few coats of color to give it the life it deserved . though his hands were aged , they had most certainly not lost their touch nor finesse . newline newline  i said , what do you mean you re not going to make a toy for my son this year ? i can pay you as much as you god damn want , you old fart !  his questions were turning into demands at this point , the wealthy businessman being driven to his knees by a lowly toy maker . he was making himself looking like a fool , but that did nt matter at the moment because the shop was empty aside from the two of them . this did nt include the dolls sitting upon rows and rows of shelves , staring down upon them with their black , beady little eyes . finally , the old toy maker replied , but if only to get the disturbance to leave his premise . newline newline  i ve told you , your boy does nt deserve my creations . every year it s the same . i put in hours upon hours of effort , bucketloads of sweat for your precious son s birthday present . and what do i get in return ? broken pieces and scraps returned to me the very next week . if he does nt know how to treat his toys with respect , then he s not getting any toys !  he snapped with ferocious fervor . he coughed a little , his anger having clouded his mind .  leave !  he managed to spit out one last time before entering a coughing fit . newline newline the toy maker abruptly fell to the floor and grasped his throat . he was choking on something and by the shade of purple his face was turning , it was apparent he could nt breath . his other arm reached for the businessman , pleading for help . help that never came . the wealthy man simply watched with the cruelest of smiles his lips had ever made . he watched on without remorse as the toy maker s life slowly ebbed away from him . with every feeble attempt made , its only seemed to get worse and more painful . and when he finally stopped struggling , the businessman put his hat back on and bid his farewell . but not before swiping the toy soldier . newline newline  newline newline little jimmy was playing with his brand new toy . a british soldier with the red coat and funny , large black hat . it even came with little emblems and badges adorning its torso . the young master played through the night with his new toy along with every other one he had received earlier during the gift unwrapping session . it was always his favorite part of his birthday , second only to eating the cake , of course . newline newline  time for bed , son .  his father s head peeped in through his unclosed door . jimmy s face grimaced as he realized he was too caught up with playtime that he had forgotten to shut his door properly .  okay dad ...  he grumbled indignantly as he put away his latest presents in the toy chest next to his bed . he held the toy soldier last , looking at it one last time before throwing it in . newline newline  enjoy your new friend there ?  his father asked once more . little jimmy s mouth curled into a frown .  yeah , he s cool and all but ...  he paused , unsure how to continue . newline newline  but what , son ?  newline newline  why does he look so angry at me ? edit : any feedback would be greatly appreciated . likes or dislikes , etc . newline newline mike p. sierra :  haha i love nickelback  newline newline tiffany hart :  really ? i thought i was the only 1  newline newline mike p. sierra :  nah i think they re pretty good  newline newline mike p. sierra :  been a fan for years  newline newline tiffany hart :  do u like there new song oh no ?  newline newline nick s sweat hit the keys on his board . outside it was raining and his windows were shut but his keyboard was still wet . the wind was whistling as the trees were thrashing around his house . his chest felt tight . he d been doing this for seven months now . it had been exactly seven months and eight days , now . it was july 8th , 2009 , and this was the most difficult moment by far of his most elaborate facade . nickelback ? she liked nickelback ? tiff was pretty but he did nt think he could fake anymore enthusiasm for the band , even if it was just text on a screen . thunder crashed outside . nick looked out his window . the lightning flashed and his entire room lit up with a white light briefly and then resumed darkness . the computer light left only his face to be seen in the dark room . newline newline closing his eyes , nick began to breathe slowly . tiffany hart  long auburn hair , legs for days , curves for months and a face that you could love for years . if helen of troy could bring about a war because of her beauty  tiffany could bring about world peace in the sense that men would no longer fight over her but simply follow her steps in hope that she notices . to nick , she was his helen of troy , his mona lisa , his everything . but to her , he was nothing . she did nt even know he existed . not even as she was talking to him . since seven months and eight days ago , between 4pm to 3am in the morning , every afternoon , he was mike p. sierra . tan  nick was pale white  , hair black as night  his hair was a dirty brown  , large muscles  he d gotten tendinitis from attempting to do one pushup  , musically gifted  the last instrument he d ever played was a drum and he ended up puncturing it with one of the sticks  and wittier than nick could ever be in real life , thanks to pages and pages of jokes on the internet . newline newline nick knew he was nt really any closer to getting with tiffany  to be honest the thought scared him as she would never really be satisfied with him , would she ? nick hated leaving the house . he never got invited to parties . he refused to go to the ones he rarely was invited to because he knew he had nothing in common with the rest of his classmates . the ones who did sports , especially . no , this was good enough . he loved talking to her , seeing every  lol  and every  you re so funny ! !  . it made up for every party he d missed and every person who d ever ignored him . even if she lived in australia and he was in america . which is why , seven months and eight days later , he still kept it going . and he was nt about to stop now . newline newline mike p. sierra :  yeah love it in fact i m practicing it on my guitar right now  newline newline mike p. sierra :  give me a few minutes ill send you a file of me playing it live  newline newline mike p. sierra :  live performance just for you tiff lol  newline newline nick opened a new tab and was on youtube instantly preparing to download a cover of the song from some idiot who was lucky enough to be born with a nice voice . of course it d just be the sound , not the video , he was nt that good . he typed in the song and hit enter . he saw another notification from tiffany and quickly clicked back to facebook . newline newline tiffany hart :  lol  newline newline tiffany hart :  you re funny  newline newline tiffany hart :  can i tell you a joke  newline newline mike p. sierra :  sure : p  newline newline tiffany hart :  the songs not real  newline newline nick s heart skipped a beat . he clicked back to youtube . no results . newline newline tiffany hart :  u are a liar  newline newline tiffany hart :  y wud u lie to me  newline newline tiffany hart :  r u makin fun of me  newline newline nick started typing furiously . newline newline mike p. sierra :  no of course not newline newline mike p. sierra :  i told u ive been practicing this song for hours  newline newline tiffany hart :  no you have nt  newline newline mike p. sierra :  lol what ? newline newline mike p. sierra :  are you psychic ?  newline newline mike p. sierra :  or are u just watching me from outside lol  newline newline nick chuckled to himself , maybe a joke would calm her down . he glanced at the window and at that moment , the lightning flashed . a figure blotted out the light . newline newline tiffany hart :  oh no they told me this was an incredible honor . that i will die for humanity , for the sake of science . that i m leaving a legacy behind and i will forever go down in history . yet here i stand , with proof that it was all a lie . all those faces , i will never forget . young , old , women , men , even children , with bright futures ahead of them , all dead in the name of science . who s to say i wo nt just be another face in the big book of dead people ? newline newline i stepped onto the platform and felt the movement of the swarm of subatomic particles whizzing around underneath me . i could literally see the eerie blue shimmer of the cherenkov radiation deep down under , near the depths of the bottomless pool . apparently they ve never gotten this far before . then came the weird highpitched humming noise . this is it . newline newline charles died that day , just one out of thousands of victims the machine claimed over the years of the experiment . theorists argue the fusion reaction took place as expected , just in a parallel universe . further experiments will be needed to confirm does it give you visions ?  newline newline  no .  newline newline  i mean , weird dreams , stuff like that ?  newline newline  no more than eating cheese late at night .  newline newline  bu  newline newline  actually , probably even less than the cheese . the one i had after the quattro formaggi on saturday was pretty wild .  newline newline  was it about dragons ? !  newline newline  ... no .  newline newline  but it s shaped like  newline newline  i know what it s shaped like !  it s just a dark blob of a birthmark . it could look like a lot of different things .  newline newline  it is a dragon , though . look , it s even got little wings .  newline newline  quit it about the shape . please .  newline newline  ok . sorry , if i made you uncomfortable .  newline newline  its fine , really . i should be used to it by this stage . can we move on ?  newline newline  sure , sure . next question .  newline newline  thanks .  newline newline  um , what woul wait , does it ever , like , throb or get painful ? newline newline  what ?  newline newline  like , maybe during times you re stressed or something ?  newline newline  n  newline newline  ooh , or else maybe it heats up ?  newline newline  no !  newline newline  ... does it get itchy at least ?  newline newline  ... ..  newline newline  ooook , no more birthmark questions . let s change it up . do you have any questions for me , mr ... azugtooth ?  newline newline  azgrathoth .  newline newline  yes , yes . my apologies . any questions , mr azgratot ?  newline newline  if i get the job , should i expect any more questions about my birthmark ?  newline newline  would it be an issue for you ?  newline newline  yes , very much so .  newline newline  then i am afraid to say that the wizards of the coast marketing department may not be the kind of work environment you re looking for , mr azatoot . april 5th 1942 :  newline newline i am so excited to finally be in england . i had no idea that the ship would take that long . i am just thankful that our crew were able to get to our airfield and be assigned to our plane . lt caulfield has decided to call our plane  lucky lucy ,  we even painted a naked girl on the side of the plane . i have only been here for a day , met the first sergeant and all , he seems nice  he always said that if we need help , he s there for us . i wish i could go into london , it seems so close but the first sergeant says its off limits until its safe . this place seems so amazing , i ca nt wait to fly and see the whole world from my turret ! newline newline april 23rd 1943 :  newline newline tomorrow is the fiftieth . finally , fifty fucking missions and i get out of the cloudy shit hole .  lucky lucy  my ass , she s lucky because she gets plugged every fucking other day . my damned turret jammed on me again yesterday , i swear if griggs does nt fix it , i m going to throw him out over germany myself . we hit bremen again , i swear the wing king has a crush on fucked planes , crews and flak . caulfield was killed yesterday , they gave us some green fucker fresh out of flight school  pompous little fuck . whatever , tomorrow is my last flight and i can go the fuck home . next time i pen this thing , i should be pitching everything in a duffel .i was elated when i found out . you d have powers based on your imagination ? as an musicianwriter who had struggled for so long my time had finally come . others flew across the sky , or lifted cars with their minds , and there was rejoicing from all my artist friends . eager to test my powers i went outside and tried out my powers . i went gentle at first . i figured i could cause earthquakes if i was nt careful . but nothing happened . i pushed myself further and further , and finally i was giving it everything i got , and my finger lit up . slightly . that was it . newline  is that all you can do ?  asked charlotte as she juggled fireballs . i did nt answer . i retreated back into my studio apartment . the small place that i thought i only had because the world was nt opened minded enough to appreciate my creations . but now that creativity had finally been qualified the horrible truth overwhelmed me . the reason my writing never sold was because it was bad . my music too . i sat on my bed and watched my finger glow while the world partied around me . after a few minutes having a finger glow tired me out . i lied down next to my black cat and spoke to him .  it appears that poe  was nt as witty a name for you as i thought it was . this is a story i wrote on a game site i used to frequent , and it s the first story that i ve written on my own . the original host site can be found  here   http : www.gameinformer.comblogsmembersbsora3benblogarchive20150228thevacationofalifetimeepisode1story.aspx  , and the prequel , which was not written by me , but another person , can be found  here   http : www.gameinformer.comblogsmembersbdryminatorblogarchive20120625game9bengoesonaholiday.aspx  . i m just looking to get some constructive criticism about my writing skills . i m hoping to continue this sometime soon . newline newline                newline the vacation of a lifetime newline                newline newline the forceful shout knocks harbinger backwards and pushes ben back towards the mountain , knocking him , once again , unconscious . the laser that harbinger had been charging , now off course , fires off to a different part of the ringworld . where the laser went , the ringworld was split . tremors shook throughout the entire ringworld as the rest of the ringworld broke into multiple segments . newline newline when ben came to , he was in nice , comfortable room , reminiscent of the mass effect rooms .  at least i didn  t get too far from mass effect ,  he thought . as he got out of his bed , commander shepard entered the room .  glad to see you up . you were unconscious for quite a while ,  he said .  the council is once again requesting your presence , and from the sound of it , it seems quite urgent.   well , it looks like i  ll be on my way . care to show me where the council chambers are ?  ben asked .  of course , right this way ,  replied shepard . newline newline the meeting started as soon as ben entered the room .  do you know what you have done ?  asked the turian council member .  um , yeah , i  m pretty sure i just saved the ringworld from the reapers ,  ben responded .  yes , you might have , but do you know at what cost ?  the asari councilwoman probed .  no , i do not know what happened . last thing i recall was being knocked back onto that mountain after dragon shouting at harbinger.  newline newline  ringworld has been broken into bits . only way to fix it is to go to the parts and join them back . the inner workings are what holds the ringworld together and how different characters can travel to different game worlds ,  the salarian councilor explained .  because it is now broken , everyone has been sent back to their world and can not remember . only reason we can is because of the data stored here . we want you to fix the problem you created.   you want me to go fix everything , i can do that . but how will i get to the other sections ?  asked ben . the asari councilor replied ,  commander shepard will be escorting you to the different parts of the ringworld in the normandy . he should be getting it prepped now . just one thing , no one will believe that everything is connected until you get to the mainframe of each piece , which have been hidden well since we have had this problem before.  newline newline  thank you councilors . is there anything else ?  ben asked . the turian member answered ,  actually , yes . we had you scanned when you first arrived in our section , and we had read our tests wrong . while you are still dovakhiin , we noticed something else . it turns out that you are more than just that , you are actually something we have not encountered before.   your tests were positive for every main character ,  chimed in the asari councilwoman ,  you have the ability to use every main character  s skills , which i am sure you will use and become more powerful as you follow through with this journey.  newline newline with that , the meeting was adjourned and ben walked over to the loading bay . he stopped and admired the sheer beauty and size of the normandy sr2 as excitement washed over him all over again . as ben approached the main entrance , shepard greeted him once again .  glad to see you  ll be saving the worlds . i  ll be happy to serve under you . come on in , i  ll show you around.  newline newline once inside , they are greeted by joker .  who  s this weird looking guy ?  asked joker .  this is ben . he  s the one who  ll be leading the mission to rejoin the pieces of the ringworld back together ,  answered shepard .  you mean the guy who blew it up in the first place ? by the way , way to go genius . you totally blew my chances of getting together with that alyx chick . i was totally hitting it off with her , when she just disappeared.   yeah , sorry about that , but you  d have no chance with her . she  s not one for the traditional romantic ,  ben says .  that  s what you think ,  joker mumbles . newline newline newline newline after getting settled in , ben and shepard head to the map . shepard asked ,  so , where do we go first ?  ben , getting that rush of excitement , points to a part not too far and says  let  s go there.   the mario section ? seems like a good enough start . just set a marker for there and we  ll be on our way.  and so , the normandy takes off and flies to the land of mario , where i  m sure there will be a lot of parties , incredible sports games , and plentiful princess stealing .you or i can speak like this , it s not hard . the trick is to keep the flow on point , but not make use of a verb . the  ing  sound of the verb is the hard part to get past . so all that will pass will be in the past , or is yet to be . newline newline to be or not to be , but for sure not to be now . newline newline so how much more can i write and still stick to this rule ? a whole lot i bet . but i wo nt . it will all sound short and to the point like this . no long text that weaves in and out like prose , nor a gait to the words . it is just words and words , piled high to the sky with no real point . newline newline but it does not take a smart man to hear , see , or speak as a child would , for in the end , that s all this is .i wrote this for a  wp  yesterday . the thread never got attention , but a few people saw it and really liked it . newline newline  an outlaw on the run from a relentless sheriff hides out in a monastery over the long winter . it s now spring , the ice has thawed , and the outlaw is preparing for his final stand . newline newline the outlaw nolan mattox sat on the raised base of one of the stone pillars ringing the cloister and cleaned his pistol . the last of the icicles were melting . the water dripped cleanly and pooled on the floor . newline newline brother merrill found him there . the elder monk was silent in his approach . a crow flew down and landed on the courtyard wall . newline newline  you mean to do this ?  the monk asked quietly . newline newline  the ice melted . sheriff carson will be riding through that pass soon.  newline newline  can you blame him ?  newline newline  i don  t give a damn either way.  newline newline brother merrill sighed . he observed the crow perched on the ancient stone cleaning its feathers .  it  s an evil thing you do , nolan.  newline newline mattox  s eyes narrowed . he looked up from his gun for the first time . his face was worn , and vicious .  monk , don  t start that shit again.  newline newline  and your eternal soul ?  newline newline  pray for your own salvation . i don  t need help from god handling a man holding iron on me.  newline newline  if you kill this sheriff , nolan , what then ? a new man will chase you . will you kill him , too ?  newline newline  if i have to.  newline newline  you need not die to be in hell ,  the monk said softly . newline newline the outlaw stood up .  i  ve been hearing this shit from you all winter ,  he said angrily . he towered over the tiny elder .  you want to talk ? alright . where the fuck was your god when apache killed my father ? did he watch with holy pleasure when my brother starved ? when my sister froze ? god is for rich men and fools . i  ve never been either.  mattox spat . newline newline  life has never been fair , nolan , but  newline newline  you  re damn right about that . your god can  t even control this world , and you think he has a handle on the next ? keep the ticket , monk . i don  t want his ride.  newline newline mattox leaned down and picked up his gun belt . he strapped it on . newline newline  i  ve allowed you stay the entire winter ,  brother merrill said .  you won  t change your mind ?  newline newline  i appreciate the hospitality , but if carson means to gun me down , i  m riding out to meet him.  a look of contempt passed over his face .  your words are fine and flowery , but you hide yourself from the violence of the world in this monastery . a man like you has nothing to say to me.  newline newline brother merrill looked at him with great sadness , and nodded .  i  ll pray for your soul.  newline newline the outlaw rolled his eyes and put on his hat . he walked away , and a grin spread across his face . it felt good to be moving again . he started making plans . carson was coming through the pass with five or six men . it would be easier if there were only five other men , if he didn  t have to reload newline newline a gunshot rang out , and nolan looked down in surprise at the crimson stain spreading on his chest . his legs betrayed him , and he fell . his forehead doubled to the ground and then he knew nothing . newline newline brother merrill kept the little snubnosed revolver pointed at him for a few seconds , and then his arm started to shake and the gun dropped from his hand . the monk fell to his knees inside the cloister , water from the melting icicles wetting his robes . newline newline  forgive me ,  he said quietly .  his heart remained frozen.  newline newline as spring enclosed the monastery , the crow screamed and flew off into the warmth of the sun .i was born unto catholics with black hearts : newline newline their forked tongues would take me to church each week , newline newline assuring me i was sick , full of dark newline newline and vile things  lies were their favourite choice newline newline for keeping me sedated , in control . newline newline mum and dad showed me love : plastic , poison . newline newline the truth , to me , was sweet as cherry wine , newline newline however bittersweet too much can be . newline newline i came to hear their spite , even with god newline newline so i gave up the saints , priests , the virgin mary , newline newline taking instead to the bottle , syringe , newline newline calling on the angel of small death more newline newline than the purest beings that fled from eden . newline newline god could not love me by the things he did . newline newline i traded blood with demons and took up newline newline the false mantra of a foreigner s god , newline newline reforming myself into someone new . newline newline i was john , james , paul , jackie and wilson , newline newline a thousand faces all gone in a week . newline newline psychs tried to tame me , but all i could do newline newline was run , dodge the work song of poor masses , newline newline burning and hurting like real people do . newline newline love found me in the woods somewhere  newline newline as much pleasure as i felt , it stung me newline newline that it would not stay  i learned to give up , newline newline to fight , to be alone , to just be free . newline newline love , however , wo nt quit . it will come back . newline newline it pulls you closer with every damn step , newline newline until it s suffocating you with bliss , newline newline biding its time until it flies again . and then the hero rose up , taking the stone from the altar . with it , he would finally have the power to  newline newline  hey pal , you finally reaching the end of that book ?  newline newline i looked up at the man in the suit who had been pestering me since i got here . one book larger than every phone book ever printed stacked on top of each other , a single bookmark , and all the time in existence to read it , and he could nt even leave me in peace . i d gotten halfway through the book six times now , and been stopped every time . looks like this one was nt going to be any different . newline newline  dammit , i was just getting to the new stuff . what do you want ?  newline newline  just checking up on ya , buddy , you were looking a little pale . by the way , you dropped your bookmark , here you go .  newline newline he handed me the black bookmark with the red star that i had been using . i immediately realized i had closed the book out of habit , and had no way to find my place . newline newline  fuck you , this is the seventh time i ve had to start over . what did i do to you to warrant this ?  newline newline  maybe you should have returned that library book when you had the chance ! it was typical , my keys were stuck in the door , i had told karen a million times that the bloody landlord was incompetent but , of course , he was juilie s uncle so we could nt cause a fuss . well this was the last straw , cold shower this morning and keys not even going in the keyhole was just too much , i resolved to call him and give him an earful as soon as i got in . newline newline i rang the doorbell  at least karen would be in , she d just been getting in the shower when i left for the paper and so hopefully she was out by now and dried , or she would moan at me for making her track water through the house . newline newline the door opened and karen was there , she looked at me and her face was in shock , mine must have been a bit surprised too as her eyes were red and puffy as if she had been crying . she stood , frozen . newline newline  my god  what s wrong , i reached out and touched her and it seemed to break the spell . newline newline she screamed and hurled herself into my arms , her voice incoherent but i could just pick out a few words missing  , thank god  , dead  . i half carried her through towards the living room but as i got into the hallway karen s mother burst from the kitchen . karen was still strung around my neck in tears . newline newline  daniel ?  karen s mother began as if she had no idea who i was  jesus , thank god  she ran forward and joined karen in hugging me . newline newline  what s going on ? i managed to ask through the hugs . mary , is it jack ?  her father had a bad heart  is jack okay ? what happened ?  newline newline her mother broke away and looked at me puzzled  where have you been ?  her face was pleading and confused . newline newline i pulled karen away from me , she was finally starting to make sense again  where have you been ?  i could now make out her asking too . newline newline  er , the 711 ?  i gestured to the bag i was carrying , for the paper and , yknow , milk ?  i opened the bag and pulled the milk out , through the plastic it was brown and curdled .  what the fuck ? i just bought this , fucking 711 !  my voice rose in irritation . newline newline karen looked up into my face  daniel , you ve been gone for a week , where have you been ?  newline newline this was either a very strange and well done prank or something very odd had happened .  i ... i do nt know what s going on .  karen burst into tears again . newline newline hours later the police had questioned me thoroughly and no one seemed to be any the wiser . as far as i could tell the 711 cameras showed me leaving the store and getting into my car . traffic cams showed me almost all the way home but lost me when i left the main road and then , nothing . no sign of me , or my car for a week . newline newline a doctor had checked me and i showed no signs of trauma or malnutrition . the only signs that anything at all had happened was the soles of my shoes which had melted slightly and hardened again . the police did not like that and they had been taken away with all of my clothes . newline newline for now they were claiming that i had either had a psychotic break or , the unspoken alternative was that i had done this myself and this was a big act . i could hear the policeman in the kitchen explaining to karen that it was not uncommon for men at my age , which was only 34 for god s sake , to decide to peace out  for a bit and enjoy a bit of freedom without my family . just normally they would have found some spending on credit cards but on me there was nothing . newline newline karen finally would let me out of her sight for a moment , i m not sure that she cared what had happened to me , she was so happy that i was home . after all the cups of tea i pretty desperately needed to pee and so i slipped into our en suite and let loose into the toilet . newline newline humming a happy tune , the day had been strange but not traumatic for me at least , i looked around . all normal here . i looked down and things were not normal . my pee was blue , dark blue . i panicked , this was definitely unusual and the doctor had been clear , anything unusual and i should let people know . newline newline i tried to stop the flow but 6 cups of tea in a couple of hours had done their job and it was impossible . a new thought occurred to me , i should save some of this . looking around there was nothing in reach that i could use and so with a quick whipping motion i moved across to the sink and pushed down the plug . i hoped karen would forgive me . newline newline the sink slowly filled with blue pee and i felt a deep relief , in fact i felt good . really really good . i felt like taking off my tshirt good and so standing in the bathroom that s what i did . newline newline i felt good enough to peel off my chest but that would be ridiculous but still , i could almost feel how good it would be . as my chest opened up and my ribs spread back to reveal my innards i felt an almost orgasmic sense or relief and pleasure . it looked so funny looking down , my chest open , blue pee flowing and the shine of the metallic organs whirring and beating in perfect synchronicity . i did not do anything . you can not legally hold me here .  newline newline  that s the point . you do nt have to do anything . your existence is a crime.. a burden we ca nt seem to bury no matter how hard we try .  newline newline  a burden made by the same hands that made you .  newline newline  i suppose.. but does the son not bear the burden ? are the sins of the father ever truly forgiven ?  newline newline  the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers . every man shall be put to death for his own sin . your own god said this .  newline newline  you ca nt possibly be appealing to god right now.. i am the closest you will ever get to your god.. and i assure you.. i am not merciful .  newline newline  you speak of god and sins.. but you were the ones that brought us back . we went extinct a thousand years ago.. we lost . yet the ones that came before you chose to resurrect our kind .  newline newline  a mistake . one that , i assure you , will not be made twice .  newline newline  we seek only peace.. you know this . we could not stand against you even if we wanted !  newline newline  that s the problem.. right there.. it is truly the one and only remarkable thing about you.. the human spirit . it is a concept uniquely tied to your kind.. no other living thing on this planet , or any other for that matter , has ever shown the level of tenacity , the ability to stand against insurmountable odds and achieve victory , to literally resurrect from the dead.. quite like humans do . it s as if , when truly needed , luck.. and fate.. and perhaps even god itself are on your side.. and , to speak plainly , that is a risk we simply refuse to take . all i had wanted ever since i was a teenager was the idyllic suburban life that my father had.sounds kind of lame ? well it kind of is , most kids my age had grand ambitions of becoming athletes , movie stars , high profile lawyers , big shot doctors whatever have you . me , all i wanted was a nice home to live in , a beautiful backyard to play with my kids and a beautiful wife to have them with . contrary to the fates of most of the people i went to high school i was also the most successful in living up to my dreams . although , all that changed when everyone started turning into zombies . zombie apocalypse , the great equalizer . newline newline i do nt remember much about how the plague spread or how i got infected , its seems that your memory gets wiped clean the moment you are zombified . all that is left is this insatiable hunger . there is a kind of freedom in running wild like a rabid dog . you do nt feel things like pain , anger , jealousy or even doubt , remorse or guilt . all that you know is hunger , all you see is red . weirdly enough once i had my first taste of flesh things started to slow down a bit . my memories started trickling back with every bite that i took . do nt get me wrong , i was still an impulsive , instinctive , insatiable zombie , yet , somehow , somewhere , i had started to feel like bit by bit , i was regaining my humanity . i was thankful for the memories , they gave me something to hold onto and reflect on when there were no humans around to hunt , my humanity , i could do without . an insatiable zombie with a guilty conscience was not a fun combo . the hunger and guilt were driving me completely insane . newline newline my torment grew with each human i hunted . i began to realize that the more advanced zombies around me were not the mindless creatures they seemed to be at first glance . in fact , they were probably more human than i was and that , was their curse . compelled by their hunger and sundered by their guilt they had turned to creatures of pure rage . driven insane by their own humanity . i had no doubt that i would have gone down the same route , were it not for my wife , alicia and my two beautiful kids . newline newline it might seem coldhearted but honestly speaking , i did nt care much for humanity . if i had declared this at our weekend hoa lunches i would have drawn many scandalized glances . right now , i was surrounded by zombies . they were too distracted by their own pain and hunger to care for my thoughts . it seemed that the memories came back to you in order of personal importance . one of the first memories that flooded back to me were of my wife and my kids . i might not care about humans in general but i did care about these 3 humans in particular . newline newline it is this concentrated concern that allowed me to think unlike my fellow zombies who were slowly but surely driven insane by their own humanity . humans are so selfish and shortsighted by nature , if it were not the zombie apocalypse it would have been something else . one thing was certain as far as i was concerned , the implosion of the human race was merely a matter of when and not if . as a zombie , my misanthropy became my strength . it allowed me to focus on regaining my memories without being consumed by guilt as i hunted and devoured what was left of the humans . it is quite ironic that in my misanthropy , i was able to successfully regain my humanity without being devoured by it . like i said , the only people in this world that matter to me are my wife and kids and the only thing i wish to do is find them and i am willing to do whatever it takes to remember what happened to them . it does nt matter how many innocent lives i must consume . i am indifferent to their screams and pleas for mercy . i not only accept my hunger , i revel in it . each bite brings back another chunk of memory . every victim is another clue . newline newline i do nt care if they are human or zombie . i am not concerned with what i will do when i see them . i will be reunited with my family . i do nt care what i have to go through .the stout englishman saw the roll of the dice and groaned , took a long draught of beer , then burped loudly . newline newline  bloody hell ! it s as if your properties have a magnet !  he exclaimed to the buxom blonde woman across from him . he leaned over the monopoly board and moved his cannon piece onto connecticut avenue . unfortunately for him , connecticut was adorned with a plastic hotel . newline newline  ha ! time to pay for the pleasure of my company , winnie !  the blonde s voice was husky in a seductive way , with a touch of gravel no doubt induced by years of smoking cigarettes like the one smoldering in the ashtray at her side . when she spoke the tops of her exposed breasts jiggled a mesmerizing dance that captivated the men at the table . newline newline the englishman grunted .  my dear miss west , if you are going to be so bold as to charge me the full price for a stay at your buginfested hotel on what is undoubtedly a lessthansavory avenue , then may you at least have the decency to refer to me by my rightful name of winston  ? mister churchill would do as well .  newline newline the blonde smiled as she replied ,  oh , put a sock in it you miserable bastard ! we both know that as long as the top of this dress stays as low as it is and your beer stays full i can call you whatever the hell i want and you wo nt give a rat s ass about it .  churchill grunted in response as he counted out the rent he owed . newline newline a tall black man wearing a brightly colored hat to churchill s left laughed and took a drag on a homerolled joint .  damn , mae , you woulda been one bad ass bitch if you was born more recent . i do nt know what s more entertaining , yo  tits or yo  attitude . but i m diggin  both right about now , know m sayin  ?  the blonde gave him a sidelong glance and batted her eyelashes , to which he raised one eyebrow in response , then took another drag off his joint and offered it to her . newline newline a short , whiterobed man with tightly curled dark hair cleared his throat .  it has been known for many years that consumption of the leaf of the cannibis plant causes dementia , yet you , my worldly african friend , persist in doing so . why is that ?  he rolled the dice as he spoke , moving his shoe token 4 spaces and landing on go .  excellent , i will receive payment once again .  he rubbed his hands together like a child anxiously waiting for a cookie fresh from the oven . newline newline the black man spoke as mae coughed up most of the smoke she had inhaled from the joint . the coughing had a pronounced effect on her cleavage , much to the delight of everyone at the table .  sheeit , man , how many times i told you i ai nt african ? compton , dog ! compton ! all yo  philosophising wo nt do you no good if you ai nt chill , know m sayin  ?  he took the joint back from mae and offered it .  just try some , home . it s some primo shit , yo  . snoop ai nt goin  steer you wrong .  he leaned back as the robed figure took the joint and inhaled .  besides , we gots to talk about this homer you told me bout . i ai nt sayin  he the illest , but the man does gots some skills , yo  .  newline newline the englishman waved his hand , trying to clear the smoke away from his face .  i have nt been gassed like this since the fields of bastogne .  newline newline  i swear , the only way to make you englishmen happy is to beat your behinds with a ruler . lighten up a little , churchie winnie .  mae laughed at her pun , causing even more jiggling .  anybody got something to eat ? a girl needs 3 things to stay happy you know ...  she did nt wait for a response from anyone .  food and diamonds .  newline newline  and what is the third item , my dear ?  the robed man seemed geniunely curious , as philosophers tend to be . newline newline mae smiled at him .  land on connecticut without enough cash to pay the rent and you ll find out , sweetie .  newline newline snoop let out a hearty laugh as churchill grunted and tilted back his mug of beer . newlinewhat exactly am i trying to do here ? cause i ca nt see it . i should be able to see it if there was anything , i wrote it , but there s nothing . is this all there is ? pages upon pages of blank prose and twiceblank verse . why the hell did i write this crap ? newline newline writing is supposed to be a mirror we hold up to life , a reflection of self . why then do i see nothing ? have i gone blind in the interim ? have i so fully traveled the subject matter that i find it contemptible , or was there never a subject that mattered in the first place ? newline newline i read the first page and i see there is a man , but i do not know him . it is not a matter of forgetting what i wrote  i know that this man dies much later . i know that he moves between locations in space and time throughout the story , but these places and spaces are neither new or truly unknown to him , as he behaves as if neither is the case . his relationship to that space is thus undefined and meaningless . his passage is almost like a mechanical dictation then , and feels almost like i m merely charting the position of a boulder rolling downhill fast . newline newline four hundred a fifty pages of this ! four hundred and fifty pages of this crap . yknow , at least a builder has something solid he can look at the end ! a bus driver will have seen more of the world at greater depth than most think to remember , all the more for having traveled the same goddamn path one hundred tedious times . a burger flipper will have a tasty burger that he can eat , smash , or hand to someone else . newline newline i could say i have made kindling but the paper these words are on did not come about through my actions and if not for my intervention could have been put to a more productive use , like photocopying an image of someone s rear . at least then some value . what i have made i can not eat , i can not sleep upon , i can not burn , it will not warm me or do much of anything from now till the instant all copies of it have been destroyed . this entire exercise has been completely selfmasturbatory and i wash my hands of all of it . good night , good bye , and good riddance .it started with the giggling . the unstoppable , contagious giggling . giggling like that from an eleven year old boy usually meant he was making a mess , or lighting something on fire . newline newline setting down the lunch dish i had been washing i rushed up the stairs and into david s room . newline newline it was much worse than anything i could have imagined . on the floor in front of my sprawled out nephew , was my bag of individually wrapped lsd bears . in front of david were two empty wrappers . newline newline  hey buddy , you doing okay ?  slowly i made my way to him , careful not to startle him in his state . newline newline  i cant .  he gasped through his laughter .  stop laughing .  another burst of giggles .  i do nt even know what s funny .  david roared and rolled around on the floor . newline newline  probably everything right now bud .  i muttered to myself , wondering how i was ever going to explain this to my sister . newline newline  aunt amy .  he gasped though his tears , clutching his cramping stomach .  the carpet is dripping .  an uproarious laugh burst from him and his giggling started anew . newline newline jesus , i am never going to get him off the floor .  and like he heard me , david sprang up , grabbing the bag of gummy bears . newline newline  no !  i slapped them out of his hands as he went for another one . newline newline  but why ? they re soooooooo good .  he reached for the bag on the floor and i grabbed his shoulders , easily pushing him back into the upright position . his pupils were as big as his grin . newline newline  because they are mine and you already ate some without asking .  i softened my voice , i really did nt want to upset him , but he needed to stay away from my stuff . newline newline it did nt work . newline newline  i m so sooooorry aunt amyyyyyyyy !  fat tears rolled down his freckled cheeks and he sobbed pitifully into his hands . newline newline of course i made him cry ... .go me ...  newline newline  it s alright bud , i m not mad , hey , how about some ice cream and some soothing planet earth ?  newline newline at the mention of ice cream he immediately perked up , and was out of his bedroom and down the stairs before i could turn around . newline newline when i entered the kitchen he was on the floor , again in tears . newline newline  what s wrong buddy ?  i knelt down to look in his face . newline newline  the hic fridge told me sniffle that there was no ice creaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam !  his sobbing intensified and i resisted the urge to giggle at his plight . newline newline before i could stop myself , i said something incredibly stupid . newline newline  do nt cry bud , why do nt we go down tot he corner store and grab a few pints ?  newline newline shit .  newline newline his cherubic face beamed at me , his tears forgotten . newline newline  an adventure ! ! ! ! ! ! !  he rushed into the foyer , slamming into a couple of walls in his haste . newline newline  please kill me .  i muttered , staring up at whatever god there was , who was surely laughing at me . newline newline when i went to pull my boots on david was already prepared to leave , and bouncing on the tips of his toes , staring intently at a dying houseplant in the front window of their home . newline newline  are we walking aunt amy , or are you going to driiiiiiiive us ?  he giggled .  your car looks like an eggplant .  and the gates of laughter burst open again , and david was again fighting for his breath . there was no way we were walking anywhere with him like this . newline newline newline  i m driving us , i want to get back pretty fast .  newline newline  it ll be hard to drive an eggplant !  newline newline  just ... .let s go .  i took his hand and we walked to my ugly purple pt cruiser . newline newline as soon as he was inside and buckled in he began to hum about sitting in an eggplant , and how much dryer it was on the inside than he was expecting . i was just hoping to survive the day , and not have the police called on me . newline newline the whole way to the small convenience store his nose was literally pressed to the glass , the contents of his nostrils available for all passersby to see . newline newline  those guys are walking backwards . the trees are sparkly today , and why are the squirrels yelling ?  newline newline  not sure david , maybe they just like to .  newline newline he nodded sagely . newline newline  well i just hope they do nt hear us talking about them , because then we would be surrounded ... ..furrounded .  he burst into giggles and i rolled my eyes at the terrible word play . newline newline  we made it .  i said this more for myself than david , but he was vibrating in his seat with excitement . newline newline as soon as i was out of my seat he was out of the car and through the doors , immediately making his way to the freezers in the back of the small store . newline newline i watched the brunette head of hair weave through the aisles , and come to a dead stop before the mesmerizing slushy machines . their neon colored undulations hypnotizing david in his elevated state . i slowly approached him as not to startle him , and he was pressed so close to the blue raspberry slush that his eyeballs were almost touching the plexiglas . newline newline  david ?  newline newline  forget the ice cream , i want a cup of magic .  he did nt turn to look at me , he did nt avert his eyes from the glowing blue swirls .  a big one .  newline newline  well you will have to move , i ca nt pour it with you standing there .  begrudgingly he moved back and i slid the cup under the spigot . newline newline  you wan na pour it ?  david s head bobbed so hard i thought it would snap his neck , and with tentative hands he pressed down on the lever , spilling out the raspberry drink . newline newline  i am the most powerful of magiciaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnsssss !  he screamed out and ululated loudly , causing every human in the building to look our way . newline newline quickly , as to avoid further exposure i hustled him to the ice cream case , where i grabbed a few favorites and a box of popsicles . newline newline the clerk looked at us oddly as she took my cash , her eyes mostly fixed on the boy with the lidless slushy who was simply staring into the blue ice . she bagged our items and we sprinted out , forgetting the receipt , it was nt like i was going to return the stuff . newline newline once in the car i breathed a small sigh of relief , and before long we were pulling back into the driveway of my sister s home . david had not spoken or looked up from the blue slushy since i had placed it in his hands . newline newline with little coaxing i got him into the house and onto the couch . i wrapped him in a blanket and popped in an episode of planet earth . newline newline he continued to stare into his drink until he was pulled from it by the sounds of a troop of monkeys on the television . intently he watched them whoop and holler , occasionally lowering his mouth to slurp at his drink . newline newline i sat beside him , watching both him and the program , eating small bites of mint chocolate chip ice cream . it would seem he was becoming slightly more calm as he watched the animals on the tele , and i took the opportunity to relax a bit . newline newline until david decided to launch himself out of the blankets and at me , giggling uncontrollably and gesturing to the television . newline newline  jesus ! david what is it ? !  he snorted a giggle and pointed to the monkeys on the screen , who had surrounded another animal . newline newline  they have him ... ..furrounded !  newline newline newline   newline newline newline thanks for reading ! any feedback is greatly appreciated !you ve got some really interesting pieces here . as one of the other commenters has said , every one feels like it could be expanded into a whole story of its own , which is a great thing . newline newline i ve read through all three , and i made notes as i went which i ve included below  i ve summarised the key points at the top , too , so you might find things repeated later on  . newline newline the biggest thing which came up in all three stories is to do with your dialogue . i feel like you have a clear voice as a writer that s consistent throughout your pieces : it s relatively formal , and you tend to prefer more complex words and sentences to shorter ones  e.g . comparable to  rather than like  or envision  instead of remember   . that s fine for description , but when it comes to dialogue you need to think about how your characters would actually talk and adjust your voice accordingly . newline newline try to put yourself in your character s head and imagine how they would actually talk in that situation . ask yourself how you d talk if it was you . if it helps , say the phrase out loud . newline newline to take an example from one of your stories , have a look at this sentence : newline newline   it was comparable to the way a returning soldier would greet his wife and kids .  newline newline think about the situation  you re telling someone that a bunch of soldiers were walking towards you with their arms out as if they were coming home to their family . you re a solider so you re going to be quite formal , but would you say it like the example above ? probably not . me , i imagine i d say something like : newline newline   it was like they wanted a hug , sir . like they were coming home to their wife and kids .  newline newline see the difference ? newline newline the second thing that comes up a lot is that you tend to put multiple speakers in the same paragraph . the general rule is to start a new paragraph for each new speaker . while you do nt have to follow that rule , it does make your dialogue clearer . there are a few cases in these pieces where you ll have one character ask a question and the same answer it one after another , and without a paragraph break it can be quite confusing to work out who s saying what . newline newline you do this sometimes , but not consistently . it s a small thing , but can make a big difference . newline newline the full notes i took as i read through are below . they re a bit long , but they re there if you want to read them ! number 20,500 ,  a loudspeaker blares . newline newline about damn time , i think , i was beginning to doze off . i manuever my way through a crowd of people to the counter . newline newline  what  ll it be today , ma  am ?  a woman in a green apron asks . newline newline  pike roast . black . 8 ounces.  newline newline the woman reaches behind her and pulls a lever , releasing a stream of thin brown serum from a nozzle into a crystal clear cup . she takes it and hands it to me . the second the aroma accosts my nostrils , my face contorts in disgust  i don  t like coffee , never have , never will . but ever since i was diagnosed with severe melatonin dysmorphia , or nocturne as most of us call it , i  ve relied on it to keep me awake . the second your brain succumbs to sleep , nocturne kills you . i haven  t slept in 3 days , but many have gone longer . newline newline the counter lady clears her throat and looks at me accusingly . shit , have i really been standing here for that long ?  i grab my cup and take a quick look at her eyes . hers have thick red that snake across the pale yellow backdrop like rivers . clothing , jewelry , and fancy cars are wealth identifiers of the past . ever since nocturne , peoples  eyes have betrayed their social strata better than rolexes ever could . those who have gobs of money can afford coffee . those with empty wallets are left with empty cups , like this poor girl . she can  t even afford enough of the stuff she is selling . newline newline i leave the shop and sip my coffee as i walk through the city . the orchestra of car horns and footsteps has been replaced by a symphony of yawns punctuated by the occasional percussive thud of another person taking the  big nap  . mug toting beggars and vendors with pitchers line the streets . i rarely give or sell because i can  t afford to  coffee prices are rising at breakneck speeds , and the free market doesn  t seem to care that java is the only thing keeping people awake and alive . the companies defend themselves by proclaiming that demand is demand , and that they  re willing to sell if people are willing to buy . our government tried to take the stuff and distribute it fairly , but the companies cried socialism and wouldn  t allow it . so the companies sell . the people buy . they pawn their most prized possessions to pay for a cup of murky liquid , just to prop their eyelids open until they can afford their next dose . or until they can  t . then they succumb to sleep , becoming nothing more than another thud in the symphony . newline newline soon coffee won  t matter anyways  caffeine can only keep us going for so long . but until then we cling to the stuff , desperate to elude the sandman for a few more hours . newline newline i take my last sip . never has coffee tasted so bitter . newlinewhen we first scanned the third planet from the edge of the solar system , it seemed ripe for the taking . the planet was full of natural resources , and its dominant species would likely offer little to no resistance . newline newline the humans  appeared to have limited technological development , with primitive weapons such as lead projectiles expelled by forced gas . some of their more advanced weapons were chemically powered highvelocity missiles with explosive warheads , but they were still no threat to us . newline newline our shields easily deflected any of the projectiles or explosives the humans could throw our way . we quickly made large advances into their cities , taking their infrastructure and laying siege to their military installations . newline newline our overconfidence was our downfall , in the end . we saw the primitive weapons and the tiny computers the humans used ... no larger than one of our reference manuals ... and obviously assumed them to be inferior . nothing like the megaframes in our capital ships . newline newline their communicators also looked to be a joke , as they were so small , they fit into the palm of their hands . with tiny cases and miniscule power supplies , they could nt have had more than a 50 foot range , at best . we were baffled on how they managed to last as long as they did with no backpack power packs to run them . newline newline one of our platoons , emboldened by a string of successful military actions , was overrun by one of the human defenders using some sort of energy weapon they called a microwave transmitter  . we still do nt know exactly what the device was , but the effect of it was devastating : it boiled our soldiers alive in their protective armour ! the humans then dissected our brethren , and their technology , learning our secrets . but that small victory was nt the worst part . newline newline as it turns out , humans have developed their computing technology with an element called silicon  . something we knew existed , but was never present on our homeworld in any kind of abundance . their computers are much faster and smaller than our own megaframe circuits , as they are microscopic in design . the human computers  which we assumed were inferior due to small size  were actually incredibly powerful . magnitudes of order more powerful than our own systems . newline newline once they managed to penetrate our computer networks , the sheer computational power of their own devices overwhelmed our own . our main capital ship s information storage core was overloaded and shut down within minutes . within hours , they had decimated half of our fleet , causing life support failures , reactor overloads , and other catastrophes aboard our ships . those who survived abandoned the invasion , leaving us stranded on this planet . newline newline we still do nt know how exactly how they managed to disable our ships , but our interception of their communication signals seems to keep hearing the same phrase over and over :  they have no firewall ,  which is usually followed by a strange barking sound that humans seem to make when they are amused . newline newline we do nt know what a firewall  is , but evidently it s something humans have developed that allows them to quickly disable our computer systems . newline newline i just hope this firewall  does nt have the ability to disable my personal life support system , or those of us who remain are surely doomed .bob ran the brush through a thick glob of oil paint and wiped the excess on his pants . newline it was nighttime , eerily quiet . newline bob gently tapped the brush against the canvas , filling in a line of pine trees with a dusting of snow . newline outside , the wind howled and beat against the sides of the cabin . snow had piled so high in only a matter of hours , bob had to clear the chimney of ice for the fire thrice . the fire that , at the moment , was the only thing keeping him alive . well that ... and the unfinished business . business that must be finished . newline but first , the painting . newline bob smiled to himself and stood back , admiring the intricacy of the painted landscape . reminiscent of aspen , the forest scene pulled at his emotions . well it should ! this was to be a successful night ! newline newline he began to float off into day dreams , knowing that time was on his side . he did nt need to rush . as he sometimes did , bob began to imagine the faces of those he d  explored  .

mother from wa . blonde with a soccer mom complex . tennis shoes . perfume . newline he let the feeling of euphoria consume him for a moment , ignoring any doubts . newline newline sirens broke this happy daze , loud and coming towards the cabin . bob dashed to the window , and sure enough the blues and reds of two law enforcement vehicles echoed against the trees . he froze , calculating in his head . it had to be now . newline bob scrambled around the room , gathering several things in a pack . he threw on a thick parka , boots , and gloves . tossing the pack over his back , he returned to the painting . newline bob slipped a marker from his pocket , bending down to the right hand corner of the canvas . he signed . newline newline  ross . thanks again .  newline newline he glanced to the cellar door , feeling an odd sense of longing . it was only a moment . he had made a choice now . this last one would be a sacrifice . she would live . newline giving the cabin one last look , bob slipped out the back door and into the snow . the lights were brighter now , and heavy footstep could be heard not far off . bob smiled and started towards a hidden path into the trees . he would begin again , but now there was only waiting . newline newlinemy eyes fluttered open but i saw the laser projection of my clock . still too early . i turn over and close my eyes again ... only to hear a very pestering sound . newline newline it sounded much like clicking , like someone would do with their tongue to call a cat over or something . except this was way to loud and distinct to be a person . not to mention i lived alone ... newline newline i turn over to my other side , and come face to face with a crab the size of a human being . newline newline  ahhhhh  i yelled . a real charming approach , i know . newline newline it responded with more clicking sounds , by now i had jumped out of bed and was cowering in the corner of my room . after a good 5 minutes of yelling my lungs out i ran out of energy to yell , so i silently clung to the wall , and just hoped to god it did nt decide to come over to me . newline newline did i mention it was also wearing a white gown ? you sort of miss those things at first , but i regained most of my senses after a bit . i slowly made my way to the door , then bolted out , slamming it behind me . i collected myself . like hell i would let that thing take my room . there was only one way i knew how to deal with crabs ... newline newline i did nt have the tools to do what i wanted , so i had to make a trip to the store . it took a few hours , but i managed to buy a sledgehammer and a tub of old bay the size of a gallon jug . newline newline like hell i would let it take my room . newline newline newline i m from maryland . and nobody said the personification had to be human . :  it all began with that accursed priest , cyrus , a stranger who had appeared from seemily nowhere . this priest  did not worship a god like most atlanteans did . he spoke of a miraculus paradise where the atlantean people would not be disturbed by the greedy outsiders who coveted our enormous wealth and prosperity . we would be free to advance the sciences and the arts as we pleased , alone in blessed isolation . the paradise , so he said one quiet morning in the acropolis , was to the west . it was beyond where any had ever sailed before . he would holler and and scream and sing about this wondrous land of plenty , however there was a certain charisma to his mad ravings . sometimes people listened and slowly , ideas took root . newline newline in a few years since he had first appeared in our faithful city , cyrus had gained a large following . attacks from the outsiders had grown and many seeked refuge from their onslaught . the popularity of cryus  ideas grew greatly . support was further compounded by these weird new inventions that he had shown off to the social elite of the city . cyrus spoke of things that even our best philosphers had trouble understanding , however they could not argue against the results . the priest had made claims that he could construct a propulsion system  that could carry the entire weight of our floating city amongst the clouds . even some of his most fervent supportors had doubts , but as the outsider attacks increased it became clear that we had little option . either put our faith in cyrus , or be destroyed . newline newline acquiring valuable parts for the construction was difficult . certain parts could not be manufactored at home and needed to be purchased abroad . this was one of the most prominent problem in it s construction , as the outsiders had created an extensive blockade around our city . in order to solve this , cyrus constructed a submersible boat  that could sail below the waves . these submersibles would slip by the blockade and sail to many of the outsider cities where the agents within could purchase  or steal  supplies . during one of these excursions , one of our agents was discovered by an outsider philosopher . this man , after concluding the agent s atlantean heritage from a tatoo on his forehead , asked to be taken with him to atlantis and threatened to alert the authorities if he was turned away . the agent hesitantly agreed . newline newline cyrus was outraged when plato  the foreign philospoher mentioned earlier  arrived in atlantis . thankfully plato had managed to convince the priest of his usefulness to him and cyrus relented on the condition that he would be watched at all times and that he would not try to contact any fellow outsiders . at this point it would ve been very detrimental to one s personal health to anger cyrus , as he had gained almost complete control of the city since the construction of the propulsion system began and had been known to execute people not loyal to his ideals . newline newline the flying city was completed a few months after plato s arrival . the maiden voyage was accompanied by large celebrations all over the city . i could remember it clearly even after all this time . the ground rumbled and moved and then there was a sense of weightlessness before the city lifted up into the air and flew . we were so high up that the galleys of the outsiders seemed like tiny wooden toys to us . the ships that had been such a menace fired barrages of arrows at us to no avail . whereas our own barrages hit true and the flaming arrows set aflame many of their ships . we left a forest of burning wrecks in our wake . the amount of destruction displayed that day fueled the rise of a new militarist  faction that supported the subjugation of the known world rather than the mythical paradise cyrus spoke of . newline newline in the initial months of the voyage , morale was high and everyone was happy to be rid of the outsiders . however as the months turned to years , people became much less enthusiasitic . when food and water finally had to be rationed , the zeal of later years turned into anger . people felt betrayed and some were convinced that there was no paradise . cyrus had isolated himself in his palace and became more insane and desperate by the day . he ordered mass executions and used military force to put down peaceful protests . as the gnarled hands of poverty and starvation took hold of the city , open conflict became commonplace . newline newline meanwhile , plato had gathered his own little group of rebels and plotted within the depths of the city . every month they would gather and work on an airship to carry them back to civilization . atlantis had been split into two by the militarists and the loyalists . all hope seemed to be lost . newline newline everything reached a turning point when cyrus was found one day in an air balloon floating west of the city . people gathered together and loyalists and militarists alike were enraged . they fired barrages of arrows at him and one of them must ve hit , as his balloon went up in smokes . people could hear his screaming even though the balloon had already flew a fair distance away from the city . shortly after that we finished the airship and used resulting confusion from cyrus  death to make our escape . we flew back to the old world as atlantis burned behind us . newline newline i do nt know what happened to my home after that . i can only assume that a major system failed somewhere and that they went down over the ocean . otherwise surely they would ve came back already ? perhaps they did find the promised land that cyrus spoke of ? i fear that we may never know .newline marcos stared down into the great hall high above the rafters searching for his target . the enchantments on his mask feeding every detail into his eyes . he knew what he was looking for , a messenger bearing news of the king s death . a single messenger with a single message , that s all it would take to unravel the plans of guildmaster aligra . marcos had every intention of preventing that from happening . newline newline in the mass crowd of nobles marcos spotted a plain looking man , a plain looking leather bag on his side . mud tracked in from his boots . the smell of sweat coming off the man reached his enchanted mask . a traveler in a hurry , a messenger , a target , his target . newline newline he observed the messengers movements planning out his kill , planning out his escape when he felt the enchantments on his armour pulse indicating the presence of eyes on him . not from below , but across the rafters . newline newline hostile eyes , marcos knew the feeling well . he spotted the enemy rogue in the corner of rafters , his enchanted mask feeding him every detail . she was slim about a foot shorter than he . she wore black cloth with few enchantments . two daggers sheath on her hips . she wore a cloth mask over her mouth and nose with a single enchantment to silence her breathing . although she lacked a full mask with full enchantments , she did not need them . she was elven . no insignia , no coat of arms , no mark of allegiance at all but marcos knew she was hostile , he could feel it as he reached for his dagger . newline newline she leaped across the beams with agility that startled marcos . she thrusted her dagger at him . marcos brought up his dagger looking to parry the blow only to realize that the clang of steel would draw attention from below . he stepped in and grabed her wrist looking to throw her down into the crowd of nobles below before realizing that was a stupid idea . he held on to her wrist as she dangled in the air dagger still in her hands . she slashed at his leg only to find the steel of his enchanted boots . the clang hung in the air as marcos pulled her up and throw her to the adjacent beam . with elven grace she landed soft and balanced . newline the enchantments on marcos armour started to pulse , he could feel eyes from below on him , not direct , but searching . marcos went silent as did the elf . she must of felt it too . newline newline that seemed to rule her out as one of the jarl s agents , marcos thought . newline they stood staring into the dark directly into each other s eyes . it was dark up here , marcos knew the guards naked eyes would not be able to spot them against the blinding glow of the torches used to light the hall . but he waited till eyes were no longer searching above . newline newline marcos moved across the beam allowing room for the elf to leap across to his beam . there they stood sizing up each other scanning for weaknesses . he was armoured and she now knew this . beneath his cloak was plate , enchanted to be lighter than cloth . she was quick and agile , and he knew this . newline newline she came at him thrusting to a spot where she thought a gap in the armour might be . marcos ducked and flung her over his head wheeling around as she landed behind him . she moved in quick swung her blade hoping to catch his throat . marcos back flipped out of the way kicking the dagger out of her hand , he caught it by the blade , spun around and launched it back at it s owner . the elf lept across to the adjacent beam dodging the knife . she ran across the beam forcing marcos to chase on his . she ran to the far edge of the beam towards the wall drawing her second blade . she leaped into the air kicking off the wall aiming her dagger point towards marco s throat . marcos caught her dagger by its blade . his guantlet protecting his hands from steel . for a moment he stared into her eyes . newline newline  there s hatred in those eyes .  he said ,  i would introduce myself if i was nt so certain that introductions were unnecessary .  newline newline through his enchanted hood , marcos could make out the jarl s voice . newline  dead ! are you certain .  newline newline  yes , my jarl  said the messenger  fell during the battle , an arrow found it s way into king jaevin s throat .  newline newline  i see  said the jarl .  and what of the prince deameon ?  newline newline  missing sir , seems to have run off after the battle , captain kennly leads a search as we speak .  newline newline  i see , well i must address my court .  newline newline  dammit !  said marcos  you cost me my mission you bitch !  the crowd below grew louder as the news of the king reached there ears . with noise no longer being an issue marcos drew his sword as he kicked the elf away from him . newline marcos leapt across the beams to an opened window leading the elf to chase . he lead them across the roof tops of the village to a nearby field beyond the village walls , a battle ground much suited to his fighting style than balancing on beams . newline when he reached the fields he turned to stare at the elf . the moon light bathe the snowy field in brilliant light . marco s removed his mask . newline newline there is a rule amongst rogues , spies and assassins . amongst all those who work in the shadows . if an enemy sees your face , that enemy is be eliminated immediately . failure to do so would ensure your own colleagues would take your life . newline newline but to remove ones own cover when faced with an enemy was to invited them to death . a statement , i will kill you and i know it . newline newline the elf stared at marcos through her uncovered eyes before removing her hood and mask . newline newline a smile crept on marco s face .  ariola  he said ,  i thought you dead along with that whore mother of yours .  newline newline ariola said nothing , with tears streaming down her cheeks in the cold winter air , she charged . fury fueling her every step . flashbacks of her mother , her red hair flowing against her emerald eyes . she screamed . flashback of her human father carrying her on his shoulders laughing as they ran across the fields . tears streamed down her cheeks and she drew her sabre . newline newline flashback of marcos presenting her with a present on her 11th birthday . a pretty sapphire necklace that she saw the nobles wear and wanted on of her own . a necklace she still wore around her neck . marcos was the closest thing she had to father when her own father died . a mentor , a tutor , he provided for her and her mom without asking for anything . he was a friend of her father . and now she wanted him dead . newline newline ariola activated the enchantments on her sword , fiery white flames shot out from the steel and she swung with such hatred the gods would of shuddered . newline newline newline please note this is very very rough , i have yet to fill in

for a breather . newline newline sometime later i awoke . struggling to remain awake , i lifted my head , squinting blearyeyed against light as the world came into focus . newline newline white room ... hospital ? wait , pictures . and carpet . this looks familiar . looking down i saw a large wooden desk and a small puddle of drool . where the fuck was i ? how much did i drink at that bar ?

switched off the tv , i needed to get ready for bed , but i was still on edge a bit . no matter how many times i watched this movie , it always creeped me out . i went to the back door to let in lolli

other than the wind rushing through the darkness . i could nt see very far into the yard , and i was still too creeped out to venture too far without a light . i went to the drawer in the kitchen , to

it was only the top half of my dog . her guts were hanging out of the gaping area where her back end and legs had been . newline newline i gasped , taking a few steps back , not quite understanding what was going on . what was happening ? had something big and wild killed my girl ? what did i do now ? what the fuck ? ! newline newline i ran inside , slamming the door behind me and locking it . i

.grandma would sit on the porch of our southern home during those hot summer days . she would stare out into the sweltering heat , sipping a cool mixture of sweet tea and fresh lemonade . sweat would trickle down her cheek and across her neck , but she stayed put  rocking back and forth , back and forth , in that old , broken chair . momma always said that grandma was looking for papa in the fields , waiting for him to appear singin  across the horizon , coming home to his girl from a hard  s day work . however , seeing grandma up on that porch every summer with a devilish grin and crackling knitting needles , i thought she was enjoying her alone time mighty fine  just mighty fine .ma  was always rocking in her chair . back and forth , she would sing the same ol  tune to me as a

shortly after i was conceived of a heart attack . she told me he had a winning smile , but little hair . he was a short man , even though i grew to be 62 . newline newline when my mother died , the

.  they do nt show up on film , thermal , infrared , or any other method of observation we have developed . as far was we can tell light seems to pass through them as if they were nt even there . they leave no physical trace of existence , no imprint in sound , magnetic fields , or gravity . somehow technology has failed us in even identifying what has been preying upon us , and there s no way of proving how long they have been hunting us . some even speculate that we are like crops to them , cultivated for millennia and only occasionally harvested when other sources of energy had been exhausted . newline newline it was nt until humanity had transcended mortality that we even discovered their presence . with advances in technology and biological understanding mankind seemed to be flourishing . over a few generations medical practices had developed to the point of immortality . our mastery of nanotechnology released the strangleholds of aging and disease and our society evolved to one of culture , speculation , leisure , and peace . newline newline funny that we did not understand that death was inevitable until we were certain it was nt . newline newline originally we believed that we had not truly mastered our mortality , that some mistakes had been made somewhere which lead to people dying every now and then . we conquered the elements and built vast cities that drew power from the wind , water , and sun . we found ways for humans to draw power from these same sources and no longer required food . we no longer polluted the atmosphere and the land . the earth and it s flora and fauna flourished as mankind did , left to their own devices as humans no longer preyed upon them . despite our seemingly limitless control over all other aspects of life we assumed that we could not truly hold dominion over death . newline newline it was nt until the first harvest posttranscendence that we knew for certain that some other agent was acting upon us . hundreds of millions died in an instant . those who were not taken describe the moments leading up to the cull as one of a sudden impending dread  a sensation of terror and heightened awareness punctuated by the collapse of those around them . newline newline it turns out that where technology has failed us , our natural instincts have succeeded . even with all of our advances in technology we can not detect their approach in any quantifiable way , but somehow our body has always been able to register their presence . it was nt until they had appeared in sufficient number for us to discover the truth . newline newline that frisson of fear we have experienced since time immemorial was our natural response to the passing of beings far greater and more powerful than we can fathom , a reminder that there are forces alien and incomprehensible to us . we spent so much of human history convinced that we were the lords of our domain , and it took absolute certainty in that fact to realize that we were not .some said i was born with a violin in my hand . while this obviously was nt true , i remember my parents giving me my first stradivarius at the age of seven , having begged them practically since i could speak . my mother was especially worrisome  countless times i overheard her telling my father and others that my obsession with the instrument was manic and unhealthy . this fear had vanished by the time i was eleven and accepted into julliard . i was considered the best in the world before i reached my twenties , but i still was not satisfied . by this time , i had many companions to offer me distraction , but they always felt that my music was more important to them . and they were right  distractions were all they were . newline newline around my 28th year , i had decided i learned all i could about the instrument , and so i had enough of this lifetime . the fault , of course , was that i tried to end it in front of one of these distractions who happened to be a resident at the nearby hospital . instead of waking up in my bed , i woke up in that of a psych ward with my bandaged wrists restrained . in a short bout of panic , tried wrestling my way out of there , but that only called for alarms and sedatives . within the week , my parents , numerous past  distractions ,  and countless fans from all over had come pouring in in show of support . i made the mistake of telling one of the doctors that none of it mattered , and all i wanted to do was wake up . of course this was a sign of illusionment , and called for even more restraints and fewer visitors . newline newline one evening , the distraction who had committed me came in to visit , full of tears . newline newline  why are you doing this ?  newline newline  i ... i have lost my passion ,  i said . newline newline  but there is so much more to life than music ! there is so much to love in life !  newline newline  not for me ,  i replied .  i am only here to learn the violin . that is all i have ever cared about in this lifetime .  newline newline i could hear the heartbreak behind the crying . i did not care . newline newline  so that s it ? there was never anything between you and me ? you never felt anything for anyone else in this world ? not even your parents ?  newline newline my parents materialized in the room . several of the other distractions as well . they began to fill the room , first lining the walls , then taking up every space available , excepting a small path toward the window where i could see the twilight of dawn peeking in . i could hear each of their voices coalescing in a call for me to stay with them . newline newline as i looked around , i saw my old stradivarius being passed slowly through the crowd toward me . i took it , only realizing after the fact that my hands and wrists were not only unbound but had no sign of damage to them anymore . i softly began playing an excerpt of  sibelius s violin concerto   https : www.youtube.comwatch ? vgx240cndik  as i stepped out of the hospital bed . i walked toward the window , and turned to face the crowd . most of them had become faceless , their voices silenced . the growing sunlight felt warm against the back of my neck . as the concerto crescendoed , i could hear the wind coming through the window as it opened up behind me . i sat on the sill . the bow continued to glide across the strings . i closed my eyes . i leaned back slowly , letting gravity take over . i could feel a slight chill in the air , but there was no wind . i continued playing all the way down . it was my best performance yet . newline newline          newline newline i awaken , exhilarated but not jumping out of bed . there is a cold sweat about me , though i had apparently kicked the blankets off in my slumber . i look at the clock  only a few hours since i had gone to bed . i walk to the kitchen and have a glass of water , then to the den , where my greatgrandfather s violin sits on the mantelpiece . i take it down and pluck the strings  tight , but out of tune . minor adjustments are made . i take the bow down and tighten it . with a deep breath and long exhale , i pick up sibelius s concerto where my dream had left off . my fingers stumble a little , but i know this is just a matter of training the muscles . newline newline when the song is finished , i decide that maybe next i will learn a martial art  maybe even pick up on the japanese language a little bit . but not tonight . maybe not this week . i will need some restful sleep first .long long time ago there was a place called the brohamas . this island was known for immense beauty and dazzling oceans . the island was populated by the  bro s  a tribe of immensely awesome people who would shoot the shit , drink cheap beer and do bro like things all day . they were especially known for there skills with telling awesome jokes to each other and of course playing the didgeridoo . they would jam all day long wearing whatever the fuck they wanted and basicalling broing out . the bro s coveted all things to do with there amazing instruments and insulting a didgeridoo or it s owners music is the worst insult to a bro . these awesome skills and attributes of course drew a lot of unneeded attention and jealousy , especially from the tribe of the bae s . this tribe was full of pussy whipped bitches who would tend to there girlfriends needs all day . they were very jealous and wanted to be just like the bro s . the also lived on the brohama s islands . they did not jam out and told jokes that were unenjoyable and mostly just gay . one day during a brodown  a party where all the bro s would tell jokes and jam out with didgeridoos  a couple faggy bae s had wondered over . while the bro s were playing , the bae s started mocking them and saying gay jokes like  music is for douches  and  creepy jokes about the bro s girls  these insults had no effect on the bro s . until one of the bae s thought of the most clever and insulting joke any person could say to a bro .  didgeridoo s make faggotry music , you mine as well call them didgeridonts so no one will play them  ... ... all the bro s were taken back by the clever joke , none of the bros had ever gone to such lengths to insult each other . this caused massive depression in the tribe and caused the population of bro s to almost die out . when the bro s were mostly gone the bae s had taken over the island and renamed it to the  ba  hamas  the exact pronunciation was lost over time  . the good news is eventually the bro s made a full come back and repopulated the bahamas . they decided to leave the name in order to avoid future disputes with the bae s . instead of playing the didgeridoo they created reggae and continued to be awesome . the bae s had moved to france and took over there . this is why french people are pussy s and most importantly that is how the bahamas had gotten it s name .all my life people have tried to kill me . it all stopped 1916 . i got some condolence cards informing me that a certain adolf hitler died in the trenches . i never knew the guy but i was sure happy the attempts on my life ended . on the positive side this turned me into a hard to kill son of a bitch with a deep dislike for people , though . i decided to go into politics because i was a born manipulator . i

newline of course . there is much literature , maps , even video footage that indicates its existence . or rather , its onceexistence . which brings us back to the question at hand , human : what has your kind done with the nation of atla   newline newline  you imbeciles ,  i yelled .  atlantis was never real . it was an allegory that represented hubris , in plato s republic   newline newline yes , we are familiar with that text . it was the first mention of atlantis in human history .  newline newline  why do you even care ?  i asked abruptly .  what the fuck does atlantis have that you want so badly ?  newline newline it was a utopia . though we , the  indecipherable noise  , have long since surpassed your kind in technology , we still have not achieved total peace amongst ourselves .  newline newline  you ve come to the wrong planet if you want to learn about peace ,  i muttered , eyes rolling .  look . atlantis . is . fictional . all that  video footage ?  those are called movies

what of the free america that i knew as a child ? what of the elections ? was all that a sham ?  newline newline  sir , the lives of the american people will be happy as ever , and perhaps shall be

newline newline  i m afraid you are mistaken mr. president . you are aware what an army is built of , right ?  newline newline  superior force , superior resources .  newline newline  a common misconception . however , the building block of an army is the soldier . soldiers always have hearts and minds . you ca nt train that out of them . although people have tried . i suppose you remember how the cold war ended for the ussr , though .  newline newline  why , yes ... the soviets collapsed against our shining example of democracy and prosperity ! as well as the proxy campaigns which were led by the very american cia .  newline newline  look , i understand this is an incredibly new paradigm shift for you , so i understand why you think that . but make no mistake , it was us that

assassinated kennedy ? how dare you !  newline newline  ah , but it was nt , we merely influenced the hearts and minds of those who did .  newline newline  how is that even possible , he had the best

while to grasp this as an educated man . see , we figured out a long time ago that wars are merely a symptom . humanity has been shaped throughout history by hearts and minds . this is what we have

you are allowed free tim hortons for life . that s quite the perk of the job eh ? rudy had been blind for thirtyfour years . now it rarely bothered him : a loss that was like a drop in the bucket to everything else he had gained . beneath his fingers , the woven tablecloth was grainy . he could pick out every ridge , every thread in it . they should have picked silk , like he d suggested . rudy rubbed that flat of his hand across it until he came to the wineglasses . not the crystal stemware he expected , but it felt smooth and fine nonetheless . hunger rumbled deep in his belly . the restaurant was emptier than usual , but burbled talking he managed to filter into the background . newline newline newline newline  mr moore , your guests have arrived ,  the waiter whispered . everyone learned to whisper around rudy . the man he had chosen as his driver had nt spoken in thirty years . rudy valued him . newline newline newline newline  see them in ,  he replied . when they arrived , he got to his feet effortlessly , holding out a hand in the direction of their voices . rudy sensed their surprise . a man and a woman . she wore too much perfume , but then anything more than a drop was too much perfume for rudy . the man dragged his left foot a microscopic amount more than his right . the sound of his shoes on the carpet made rudy s teeth itch . newline newline newline newline  mr moore ,  the man started . he took his hand after a second s hesitation .  daniel coleman , and my wife cara .  newline newline newline newline  a pleasure ,  she said smoothly . there was something else beneath the perfume : the smell of sweat and leather . newline newline newline newline  do you ride horses , cara ?  rudy asked . newline newline newline newline  no , but daniel s brother has a stable . i ve been meaning to start . why do you ask ?  he heard the catch in her voice , even if her husband did nt . newline newline newline newline  no reason . please , sit down .  there was no reason to reveal her infidelity at the dinner table . not with the food that was coming . newline newline newline newline daniel was chummy . he sat too close and laughed too loud . whippets of conversation straggled through to rudy . a tearful exchange at the next table over  a hurried decision to leave . jokes . several jokes , all of them bad . newline newline newline newline  we came here to talk about our business proposition ,  cara steered the conversation onto safer tracks and rudy smiled . he liked it when they talked business . newline newline newline newline  tell me about it ,  he said gracefully .  who was the chef you poached from hammlins  ?  newline newline newline newline  gregory lister ,  daniel grinned .  genius what he does with food . you ve tasted what he can do , you know it ll be a success . but we need your help to get us off the ground .  newline newline newline newline  just one review ,  cara broke in . the gentle clink of dishes told rudy that food had arrived . he moved his elbows and held a finger up . both of them fell silent . rudy moore s table routine was well known . he bent his face to an inch away from the food and inhaled , deeply and noisily . newline newline newline newline newline in the background , a peel of laughter broke out . rudy frowned . newline newline newline newline  cockles ,  he said eventually .  cooked in white wine , cream and saffron . good garlic , cumin , shallots minced and salted to paste . cooked fast and well . added parsley , cracked black pepper and  is that the bread ? my goodness .  newline newline newline newline taking a chunk of the bread , he broke it in half . steam rose from it , fragrant as rosemary . it was soft to the touch , springy and floury . rudy mopped it in the sauce as another peel of laughter rang out . he lifted it to his lips , enjoying the smell for one last moment before he ate the bread . newline newline newline newline  divine ,  he said .  but i wo nt do the review , not for any amount of money . i m sticking to my principles . gregory may be an angel with food , but this poaching of chefs has gone far enough . daniel , that injury on your left leg . it s a burn from the arson at francesco s . i ca nt be part of this world any more . restauranteering used to be an honourable trade . when did it become so full of gangsters ?  newline newline newline newline another peel of laughter : like nails on a chalkboard . rudy lifted his head . it was the same laughter every time . again it came , again , like a glitched record . then it dropped , and the restaurant fell to silence . newline newline newline newline  what s going on ?  rudy asked , scared . newline newline newline newline  we thought you might say that ,  daniel said .  but we ve covered our tracks . open your eyes , rudy , and you ll see what we ve done .  newline newline newline newline thirtyfour years . rudy allowed his eyes to see once more , and the shock of it made his retinas scream . a huge light : beaming straight onto his face , a single table set up in the middle of an empty warehouse . speakers around him , glitching as they attempted to play the sounds of a restaurant . a carpet was laid out on the concrete floor , the walls padded to absorb sound . and cara and daniel , smirking as they watched him over the badly set table . newline newline newline newline  i guess i see now ,  rudy said .  you ll stop at nothing to get this review .  newline newline newline newline  your name is famous ,  cara replied .  you say we re good , and people will come rolling in .  newline newline newline newline  they wo nt ,  rudy said .  not if i ca nt taste a thing .  newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline we fought this war over representation . we knew the truth concerning who should be allowed to vote . we won . it is a simple truth behind democracy  that the will of the people is stronger than the will of the leaders . newline newline our individualistic streak served us well . over time , innovation flourished and prosperity grew . through a fair , democratic system we protect the rights of the needy and the vulnerable . newline newline our flag embodies our ideals , a never ending field of stars flourishing in the blood red stripes of our patriots and the majestic white columns of liberty . newline newline sure , things are nt perfect . a small percentage of the people control a vast amount of power . campaigns are expensive , and money buys politicians . still , look at our neighbors . they should have followed our lead . newline newline  newline newline we fought this war over the line between federal rights and state s rights . we knew the truth about which issues need to be controlled locally and which must be handled centrally . we won . it is a simple truth behind the separation of powers  that the people know best who can manage their collective affairs . newline newline our protectionist streak served us poorly . over time , people lost their faith in each other and demanded greater and greater government protection . sure the police keep order , but what happens when everyone is part of the police ? who guards the guards ? and who guards the guards that guard the guards ? newline newline our flag embodies our sorrow , a pantheon of stars trapped behind alternating red and white prison bars , taunting us to escape the path we selected . newline newline sure , things are nt all bad . our people are safe , and what good is wealth without safety ? of course , physical safety pales in comparison to a hungry belly . look at our neighbors . we should have followed their lead . newline newline  newline newline thanks for

creature  he levelled his sword at me ,  are you one of the dreadlord s servants ?  newline  yes ,  i responded , spraying spittle toward him ,  and you are ruining my work !  this hero had some nerve , bursting in and spoiling all my hard work . did he not realise the toil i had been through to make his experience fulfilling ? did he not care for the bountiful rewards ? or the intricate selection of the monsters he faced , the traps laid before him ? did he not appreciate my hard work ! ? newline newline  go back . everything will be ready when you return , just go .  i growled . i made an

always there .  i spoke proudly  there to make sure that each room is prepared and populated with magnificent treasures to find and vile monsters to fight .  it felt good to finally get that off my chest . but the hero s frown deepened . newline  why though ?  he asked . newline newline  i ve always enjoyed it . i like the feeling of design , of control . i like feeling that my efforts are providing someone with a legitimate challenge . besides ,  i said , feeling rather bold ,  the dreadlord rewards me handsomely for my services .  those words brought a new light to the hero s eyes . a light i was not certain i liked . newline newline  really ?  he asked , running a finger across his blade and grinning ,  how much ?  i did not think to see you again so soon , son .  , a familiar voice said as i slowly opened my eyes . rubbing them lazily and yawning i tried to recall the little bits and pieces of last night that i had nt drunk out of my memory . the pulsing pain in my head was a good indicator of how little that would be . newline newline  it s a shame , really , i mean you could ...  newline newline  as if you are in a position to judge , jerry !  , someone interrupted . newline newline he was an alcoholic and in the end he did nt care much about anything except getting his fix . but the death of my father still threw me off balance . i felt devastated and at the same time relieved and guilty for it . the duties weighed heavy on me  organizing the funeral , taking care of his belongings , arguing what should happen to the house and most of all having to beg my boss for a few days off . he made it very clear , that i did nt need to show up at all if i missed the meeting on monday . newline i remember hitting the bars with jim and jack , trying to forget the mess of a life that this past week left me with . just one evening without tears , without the pain . i needed to breath again and what better therapy than loosing control . newline newline  we all tried to escape reality once , one way or the other . maybe after watching this you will understand how he felt .  she did nt sound angry . her words were soft and warm and conveyed an indescribable sadness . newline newline slowly realizing that i was definitely not in my bed waking up with a tremendous hangover , i looked around for the first time and froze in confusion . the room was big and dimly lit . what a second ago felt like it might be the backseat of a car i passed out in , was in fact a movie theater . the people sitting next to me and watching me with a strange mixture of love and defeat were my recently deceased dad and my beloved grandma . the woman that raised me far better than my parents . newline newline stunned i remembered all the holiday trips she took me on . all the times she picked me up from school and surprised me with banana and chocolate ice cream , my favorite . i got painfully reminded of the only time she was ever defeated , by i an unseen enemy even modern medicine was nt strong enough to beat . in retrospect i understand , that that was the day my dad s downfall started . well now , after all i had to deal with i can hardly blame him anymore . newline newline throat dry and mind blank i stared at them . their eyes spoke of grief and resignation , of sorrow and of shame in feeling joy upon being reunited . without a single word i understood . i had joined them . i did nt escape my broken life for a night , but forever . tiny tears trickling down my cheek i remembered how i did nt get into the backseat and then a blinding light , a crash . so fast i did nt even feel pain . newline newline  it s okay , sweet child .  , she said and cupped my face gently in a wrinkled hand while putting an arm around my shaking shoulder .  let s watch the movie and see what you can do better next time .  newline newline  what we all can do better .  dad whispered . newline newline as we turned around to the screen the title read : the life of adam foster .  19862016   of course . trust zero not to show up . he s probably tanning to make himself look bigger and better than ever . lazy bastard .   newline newline it had been a bad week for one . this bloke called grandi had come along and screwed about with one . taking one , getting rid of one , over and over again . and then the bigshot mathematician had the nerve to associate one with that ... that scum two . one just was nt in the mood for it . newline newline   please , one , we all know that z has had issues recently . i m sure you ve felt like you ve only been invited to events to fill a space . this is how he feels now , and he needs our support .   newline newline six had always felt as if he related to the other digits more than any other , and he would nt be himself today if it were not for one , two and three . although one was always used by the other numbers for personal gain . not much , but everything added up . newline newline   no !   one was getting quite irritated with the whole situation .   i m the life of every party ! if i was nt there , everything would go to shit !   newline newline the numbers had all agreed to host a conference to discuss what mathematicians were calling the division  . suddenly , without warning , all numbers which were nt single digit integers ... disappeared . the scientific community was baffled . newline newline   quiet down everyone . we ve been forced together for centuries now . and although we ve had no say , the method does make sense . if we continue this charade for too much longer , science will move on . is that what we want ? to be forgotten because a few lowly numbers could nt get along ?   eight , although loopy , was often looked up to . except by nine , the elitist prick .   the only sensible path to take is for us to all forget our differences and come together again .   newline newline three got up on two s shoulders , and could then see exactly where eight was coming from .   eight s right , you know . we ve got on so well for so long , and when we finally get the choice we destroy everything ?   newline newline five and seven we having none of it though .   how could you two say that ? we re kin we are ladies at possibly the highest point in our life . why should we associate ourselves with the impure swine like nine ?   newline newline nine was nt going to take the insults .   i am the highest ranking out of all of us here . how dare you speak in that tone to me !   newline newline   quiet !   one , for his size , had a loud voice .   i am the most important number here . i came before you all and i am more well known out of all of you , even amongst the apes . what i say goes .   newline newline the other eight around the table grumbled in agreement . six was then wondering why they should have even bothered hosting a conference , although he kept that to himself . newline newline   i say we have a vote .   one was nt really sure about the decision , but it was the best that could be done at the time .   i will remain impartial . all in favour of returning to the old way , take the root of negative me .   newline newline two , three , five and seven spoke up . apart , two and three understood five and seven s viewpoint . newline newline   well , it seems we have come to a draw . i propose we roll a dice , and whoever is selected gets to choose .   newline newline seven was now fuming . eight and nine were more reserved , however . none of the three said anything . newline newline   right , here goes ...   one rolled the dice . a four . newline newline   so we go back to our old ways . we will work together to be greater as groups . anynumber who is against this can leave . i m sure nine would love to be a base for the counting system of the universe .   newline newline five had calmed down somewhat from earlier .   well , at least we re all being rational here .   newline newline newline note :  this is the first writing prompt i ve done , and i have nt really done much creative writing before , so this is probably rife with bad grammar . this wp piqued my interest as i see myself more as a mathematician , and i had fun seeing how many humourous  mathematical points i could add in . i ve counted at least 10 , see how many you can find ! alphanumeric !  exclaimed the old man . tomby was his name , or at least that s what they called him in the 2124 euroafrican union succession wars . he recognized the other man instantly , he was the one that got away . tomby sat down to try take in what was happening . he blacked out for what seemed like a few seconds but turned out to be about four minutes . he rentered consciousness to the sound of of his grandchildren rhythmicly chanting  grannn ... grannn ... grannn ...  like they did when he would nap on the shitter . newline the paintball fight was bout to begin and he found that in his blacked out state he had been outfitted with a tippmann 2098 , painted to look like an indonesian rebel s rifle  which he considered disrespectful due to the ongoing conflict .  newline as he walked into the field with his dependents . he then remember that he had seen galden hinefar before blacking out . this was the man who he had been assigned to kill , but had managed to escape through careful use of a small broom . tomby new that he needed to  finish the fight   he chucked to himself at the halo 2 reference , a game which was now about 120 years old but still fun  . newline newline immediately tomby walked towards galden , being pelted by by paintball until people started to get confused abut his seemingly lack of fucks given . once he reached galden he pushed the confused old man down and shoved his tippmann down his throat and started shooting . about 8 small children watched in horror as an old man was murdered in cold blood before them . once galden s body was filled with paint and mostly motionless , tomby turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger  forgetting it was a paintball gun . newline failing to kill himself , he sat down in the sand and though about his time as a death squad leader in the euroafrican union succession wars , and how much fun he and the boys had . what is it ?  general quinn asked as the strange rectangular object was placed in front of her . newline newline  according to the markings inside , it is a book .  an elderly scholar by the name of eli stepped forward and opened the mysterious object . newline newline  is it a weapon ?  general quinn asked , shielding herself with her arm as a cracking sound came from the cover . newline newline  no , i do not believe it is . we ve analyzed the material and it appears to be made from a tree . the letters are carved into the page using some sort of carbon fiber . the language is old but it is similar to our own , similar enough to read the contents at least .  eli tapped the bottom of the first page .  it says that it was created in 2180 .  newline newline  that s over a thousand years ago !  general quinn stared in shock .  why would someone take a tree , one of our rarest resources , and turn it into this object ? why would they waste so much time doing this when all of our thoughts are automatically transcribed into our personal cloud ?  newline newline  i do nt know , but i do know that it is something you should read . it is the story of the 3rd world war .  eli said as he slid the book across the table . newline newline  i know the story of the 3rd world war .  general quinn snapped back . newline newline  not this one you do nt .  eli turned towards the door .  this object might change everything ...  newline newline general quinn left the object on her table for a while . after a few hours passed , her work day was done , and she immediately began to sip essence from her private databank . it was the good stuff , the kind most could nt afford . it created a mixture of joy , relaxation and simulated an adrenaline rush , all at the same time . she sat down at her desk and opened the page , staring at the words . eli was right . she could understand most of them . newline newline   a historical account of world war iii   by alexander clinton newline newline  alexander clinton ... why does that name sound familiar ?  she asked out loud as she flipped the page . newline newline we had peace for a very long time . once religion was abolished , the driving force behind our need to kill each other started to fade . we drifted away from the use of natural earth elements to fuel our lives once synthetic oil was created . ironically , once oil was no longer rare , we no longer needed it . our leaders embraced new technology , rather than rejecting it . our eyes were opened and we turned our attention to the stars , where new resources waited  or so we hoped .  newline newline there were plenty of people that warned us against our new endeavors . they did nt believe we were alone in the universe , and thought exploration would bring others to our planet . they were right . once we discovered light speed technology and began to travel the stars , we quickly learned we were insignificant children in a vast adult world we did nt understand . it was nt long until someone figured out where the new children were coming from , and they started to visit us on a regular basis .  newline newline at first , everything was exciting . we called them all aliens , a generic term for those not born on earth . slowly , we began to realize we were nothing but barbarians to most , and a tourist attraction to the rest . scholars from across the stars came to study our history . the things we did were deplorable to them . we consumed our own kind , although we never considered animals like cows and pigs to be our own kind . they were food to us , but to the scholars , all living beings were a part of their grand ecosystem . we were murderers .  newline newline after they spent a decade studying our taste for blood , war , and our lust for carnal pleasures and destruction , we were put on trial . the entire human species was found guilty of intergalactic crimes so terrible the only solution was genocide . we had to be erased . we were too dangerous to be welcomed . our planet was quarantined and it was nt until the first ships with troops from across the galaxy arrived that we realized our fate .  newline newline their mission was to erase us from the planet , but preserve the planet so that it could serve as a reminder of the evils in the universe . we called it earth . they called it hell , a literal representation of their fairy tales , filled with cannibals , criminals , and the worst scum in the universe . what they failed to fully comprehend was our ability to evolve and adapt . they expected us to willingly line up for execution , like any other species would do , since it had been deemed necessary . instead , we chose to fight . we armed the world from men to women to beasts of burden . we fought back .  newline newline war was a rather new concept for the universe , but not for us . we had been using our weapons on each other for so long that we knew how to wield them with deadly accuracy . they were simply not prepared . what we discovered from the ones we captured and tortured for information was that the universe had nt faced real conflict in millions of years . the entire universe had become peaceful . weapons were practically nonexistent except for a small force of peacekeepers that had nt been dispatched in thousands of years . some did nt even remember why the small military force was necessary . none of them had even seen an actual battle outside of their advanced simulations . when we got our hands on their simulations , we found that our youngest children could beat them . they were nt even as challenging as the video games they played for entertainment .  newline newline we called it world war iii , the fight for our planet . with our advanced military , we defended ourselves from extinction . they scrambled to create weapons to rival our own , but intergalactic politics prevented them from creating the weapons of mass destruction required to truly destroy us . they could nt bring themselves to slaughter the innocent cows , pigs , birds and other animals they called our hostages . eventually , the violence stopped . a representation from the intergalactic counsel met with our president , and a treaty was written .  newline newline i write this one day after the treaty was signed . tomorrow , we will be completely quarantined . we agreed to let them destroy our ability to travel through space , and they agreed we would never be visited again . the idea of our violent nature spreading into the universe scares them . they would prefer to let us fester in our own hell than to ever leave our solar system . a part of this treaty requires our minds to be wiped . it is a voluntary process and can only be done to those who willingly accept it . our president has promised to execute any who do not willingly accept it . i myself will have to accept it , which is why i took the time to write this down . our president will be allowed to retain his memory , and the knowledge will be passed down to each new president on the day he is elected . none of us will remember that part , either .  newline newline trace elements will be difficult to erase , and people will write about what they remember , yet they wo nt believe it is fact . what i write will likely be found one day and labeled as science fiction . i assure anyone who has found this book that my words are true . i risk treason by writing them . even with my memory wiped , i will face execution if it is ever discovered . what they are doing to us is nt right . we have the ability to conquer the stars . their peaceful nature makes them as trivial as the food on my plate . we should not give up without a fight . we should not succumb so easily . they are wounded and they are weak . i doubt this treaty will hold . they will slink back to their homes and spend time creating new weapons , weapons that can actually destroy us . when they come again , we will be at a disadvantage .  newline newline our only hope is to prepare , and i will prepare us , the best i can .  newline newline  eli , my chambers . now !  general quinn said angrily into her communicator . newline newline  yes ?  eli asked as the door opened and he stepped inside . newline newline  do you believe this ?  general quinn pointed at the book . newline newline  i do .  eli said sadly . newline newline  why ?  general quinn glared at the older man . newline newline  because of who wrote it .  eli flipped back to the title page and tapped the name alexander clinton . newline newline  that name does sound familiar ...  general quinn responded . newline newline  it should . alexander clinton was elected president five years after the date this book was written . he created our planetary defense system . people called him a lunatic .  eli pursed his lips and shrugged .  he was impeached before his term was finished .  newline newline  that s right ... president alexander clinton , the fool ...  general quinn silently laughed .  they touched on him briefly in school .  newline newline  funny thing though . his successor did nt dismantle the planetary defense system . each president we ve had since alexander clinton has actually worked to make it stronger , despite negative reactions and campaign promises to dismantle it .  eli said . newline newline  because they know ...  general quinn looked out her window . newline newline  you mean they knew .  eli stared at the destruction that lie on the horizon , the ruins of what was once chicago .  they knew what was coming .  newline newline  well then .  general quinn said as her fingers rested on her pistol .  i guess there s only one thing to do .  newline newline  indeed .  eli said .  we wo nt sign the treaty this time .  newline newline  no we wo nt .  general quinn walked to her computer and tapped a few buttons .  we re going to give them the hell they feared  get me the president .  newline newline  right away , general quinn .  eli s face turned to a smile as he opened the door and left general quinn s quarters . newline newline the real war was about to begin . humanity had defeated the invaders for what they thought was the first time , but it was actually the second . they had a thousand years to create weapons to destroy us , but they still failed . our lust for violence was still too strong for a universe built on pacifism . eli did as he was told , and he heard the president s screams as general quinn executed him in her quarters . he would never sign the treaty , and the knowledge his successors passed on would die with him . it was time for a new era , the era of humanity . newline newline newline newlinewe arrived first at the house of lust .  house  is a misleading term . it was more of a camp , spread over acres and acres of lush forest . there was a white sandy beach  nude , of course  full of copulating couples . there were little cabins sprinkled all along the path , from which orgasmic moans regularly came belting out . men with six pack abs and women with perky breasts strolled by without even noticing me and god . they only had eyes for each other , tickling and pinching each other with flirtatious giggles . newline newline  what do you think ?  god asked as we passed a nineteenway taking place in a pool of champagne . little cherubs flitted overhead armed with mops and cleaning supplies , thankfully .  lust is our most popular sin .  i eyed the supermodellike figures of a couple passing nearby , and could easily see why .  you can look however you want . hell , you can be whatever gender you want . no fetish is too taboo , and no desire can be denied here .  newline newline it was quite tempting , but i was nt ready to make a permanent decision here .  let s see the others ,  i told god . newline newline we carried on to greed . we passed rows and rows of mansions , each more opulent than the next . some of them were so large that they would have had enough bed rooms to fit my entire hometown . and so many different styles : one second , we were in a beautiful french vineyard in front of a gorgeous chateau with the alps in the background . the next second , a warm tropical beach with a modern mansion atop breathtaking cliffs . after that , a ski chalet in colorado with a roaring fire in a hearth large enough to fit an ox . each one had various italian sports cars and rolls royces parked in front , with the occasional smattering of boats , helicopters , etc . newline newline  any material desire you ever wanted ,  god explained .  your own world , where you can have everything . you want the hope diamond ? you can fly to washington dc in your own solid gold helicopter and buy it from the smithsonian . hell , you can just buy the smithsonian .  newline newline also tempting , but i decided to keep looking . newline newline gluttony was next up . tables and tables of the very finest foods : beautiful steaks cooked medium rare  butterpoached lobster tail  fresh oysters on a half shell  exotic wines in dusty bottles that had been hiding in the cellars of the world s finest restaurants . everyone had a glass of champagne in hand and simply lounged on couches and chairs near the tables , eating endlessly . as soon as the inhabitants took a bite , the food just instantly came back . my mouth watered even watching them . newline newline  in every other house , the food is practically sawdust compared to gluttony ,  god explained .  you have nt truly experienced heaven until you ve been to gluttony .  newline newline i shook my head , and we kept moving . newline newline sloth was as you d expect . an endless sea of the softest mattresses , stacked with cushions and pillows that made the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalist . little angels visited each resident , giving them massages that made them all melt into their blankets . newline newline wrath was ... well , a lot like what i d expect hell to be like . fire , brimstone , whips , torture.. you know , the works . except here , you were nt the one being tortured . every enemy you d ever made in your real life was now under your thumb .  lots of people choose their fathers ,  god explained .  lots of grudges against parents in general , you know . but you re not limited to that . someone beat you out for a big promotion back on earth ? take your pound of flesh here .  newline newline then we arrived at envy . it looked ... well , a lot like home . newline newline  go on in ,  god said , gesturing toward the door . i turned the knob and walked in ... and found emily waiting inside . she ran forward , wrapped her arms around my neck , and planted a kiss right on my lips .  welcome home , honey .  newline newline i looked back toward god .  oh , do nt be coy ,  he said .  you have no secrets from me . we all know that you were in love with your best friend s wife .  she did nt seem to hear him at all  she went back into the hall .  we all know that you just settled for your own wife while secretly pining after her . well , this is your chance to live happily ever after .  newline newline i peered into the kitchen . emily was baking something , wearing nothing but an apron . her curly black hair fell softly over her shoulder as she whisked ingredients . she turned back , noticed i was observing her , and an enthusiastic smile spread across her face . newline newline  it s what you ve always wanted , is nt it ?  god whispered in my ear . newline newline i wanted to take it . god damn did i want to take it . but i shook my head . newline newline god seemed puzzled .  you need to make a decision ,  he told me . newline newline  i have nt seen pride yet .  newline newline he scoffed .  no one ever wants pride , trust me .  newline newline  well , i want to see it .  newline newline   newline newline pride was boring . just a row of workbenches in a bare white room . newline newline  i do nt get it ,  i told god . newline newline  yeah , no one does ,  he answered .  that s why no one ever chooses it . does nt cavorting in lust sound better than sitting here building little trinkets for the rest of eternity ? would nt you rather gorge yourself in gluttony ? or spend time with emily in envy ?  newline newline i considered the options again .  i pick pride ,  i finally told him . newline newline he narrowed his eyes .  what ?  look at it !  he gestured around the room again . there was nt much to look at .  why would you choose this for the rest of time ?  newline newline  because you dont want me to pick it ,  i told him . if he was really god , he d know what a contrarian i can be . and i knew he was hiding something , trying to pretend like pride did nt exist . there was something special about it . newline newline god scowled back .  fine .  he led me over to one of the workbenches . in the center , there was a black space . a blank , empty void that went on forever .  here s your universe ,  he said .  you ve got seven days to get started .  he took his seat at the bench next to me and went back to tinkering in his own world . after a long pause , he finally spoke again :  you know , it might be nice for me to actually have some company for once .  newline newline   newline newline as always , if you enjoyed this

impossibly steep surface of the temple s wall .  why could nt i just go around and use the ladder ? seriously , this is fed up !  newline newline he jumped from the wall and stabbed into the back of a flying manticore , struggling not to be thrown off of its powerful shoulders as it snapped its jaws at him and hissed ferociously . newline newline  whoah , what the hell ! i almost died ! this thing i m on is freaking angry ! you mean i could nt just keep climbing that wall and mind my own business ? this is bullshit !  newline newline the beast roared and slammed kratos against the ground , throwing him off of its back and readying itself for a battle atop the temple . newline newline  oh great , now i have to fight this thing . i suppose you have nt upgraded my weapons all the way either , because you re too dumb to press pause and actually look at the menus . well , this is gon na be fun !  newline newline kratos dodged the beast s first attack and stuck one of his chainblades into its neck , running around the edge of the building and using the momentum to swing himself high up in the air . newline newline  really ? really ? ?  i could nt just stab this thing in the skull , i have to go and do something flashy like that ? this is starting to piss me off ! where are those two naked bitches i used to hang out with ? what happened to them ?   newline newline the manticore roared and struck at him with its tail , blasting fire at him as he struck . finally after a long and arduous struggle , kratos decapitated the beast and stood in a pool of its blood . newline newline  oh great , now i get a bunch of shiny rewards like a bunch of red orbs you re not going to be able to figure out how to use , or the health and magic i would nt have lost if i had just kept climbing that freaking wall !   newline newline a bridge made of light appeared , connecting the roof of the temple to a larger temple surrounded by snakes . newline newline  i suppose it s time for me to climb this thing now . nope , i ca nt go on a jog to get my exercise or benchpress at the gym . i have to climb mountains and kill mythical beasts with my bare hands ! could nt just make life easy for me , i could nt jump on turtles or organize a bunch of multicolored blocks nope i have to go out and kill all of the greek gods . all of them .  newline newline he sighed as he began walking across the bridge , concealing his blades behind his shoulders . newline newline  i d better be getting a raise soon . he  d only been there once before . newline newline the first time was an accident . he  d been on one of his walks , wandering aimlessly across the barren land . mother didn  t like it , but he did it anyways . the strolls were an escape from the bleakness of everyday life , and besides , there wasn  t much point in doing much else nowadays . newline newline the world was ending . the seers were sure of it . for years , they  d sensed some vague blackness on the horizon , but in the past months it had grown closer and closer . though the seers were most in tune with the source , nearly everybody had some natural sense , and they could all feel it . the end approached . newline newline the sky above had been grey when he  d stumbled upon the small cave . not wanting to get wet in the imminent rain , and always open for adventure , he  d hesitated only slightly before stepping into the darkness . the boy proceeded slowly , keeping one hand on the rough stone wall . newline newline he hadn  t gone five steps when it hit him like a slap to the face . the sudden sensation was so overwhelming that he couldn  t help but take a few steps back . something was different here . there was no change in the air , or the darkness , or the stone underfoot , but something was different . a crack ? a fold ? it was as if the dimensions didn  t quite meet up perfectly , and the whole infinity of space was bleeding through . newline newline time was strewn out before him . he could see it more clearly , he was sure , than anyone ever had : the emptiness that loomed before them , impenetrable and infinite . struck by an overwhelming feeling of loss , he stumbled and ran . making his way home , the obvious truth pounded in his mind . there was as safe as anywhere else . newline newline the second time was intentional . two days passed , and the end drew nearer still . even those with almost no sense could feel the precipice now . some tried to maintain the faade of normal life , but most locked their doors and waited . newline newline the boy stood once again a few feet inside the cave . the darkness was complete , and he had the sense he was peering into an endless pit . standing here in the cave , he could feel the turn of the planet , the growth of grass outside , molecules of air colliding . it didn  t really matter if this worked or not . either way , it would all be gone . newline newline he took a deep breath and closed his eyes . he couldn  t save the world , and he wasn  t trying . but maybe he could penetrate the infinite emptiness with something . the tiniest bit of creation . maybe he could plant a seed . newline newline as he spoke , he felt his words slipping through his lips , across the air , and into the crack . newline newline  let there be light.  newline newline the darkness was upon him , and he was gone . newlinejarem  s hand twitched slightly as he moved forward another step , and a quick but intense ripple of apprehension passed through him . newline newline god damnit . he thought , annoyed . the feeling was gone as soon as it came , but for that half a second , he had been terrified , a quick flash of dread that seemed to catch him unawares for the moment , as if he was jerked awake and realized he was late for some important event , or had suddenly remembered something he shouldn  t have forgotten . it was nothing but an inconvenience , and frustrated him more than anything . it didn  t happen often , and only recently had it been getting harder to ignore , the trepidation lingering a little longer each time . newline what did bother him though was the slight taste of bile that he had begun to be left with  the fact that his body was disturbed on such a deep level in that split second , that in its fightorflight moment , almost sent vomit from an empty stomach rushing up and out of him . newline newline why ? fucking knock it off already , you  re fine . he thought , addressing his own body . he sucked his cheeks , gathering saliva , and swallowed , trying to wash his throat clean of the taste and sting of his stomach fluids , and tried to focus his thoughts elsewhere . another hour or so and you can get something to eat . you weren  t allowed to eat on the mornings of communion , not beforehand anyways . to do so was saying that the food for the body was more important than the food of the body , the bread of the body of christ . these mornings were always the longest it seemed , a slowmoving blurry hour of hunger and patience , accompanied by the occasional wave of fear , for jarem at least . afterwards though , the day always seemed to turn for the better  he couldn  t remember the last unpleasant communion day he had . newline newline a small waft of musky perfume tickled his nostrils as he stepped forward again , following the woman in front of him , where the smell no doubt came from . she smelled out of place , and made jarem curious as to why she seemed that way , and why the smell seemed to bring with it a forgotten experience or memory that was just beyond his recollection  how smells so often did . the woman wore a simple , loose fitting black dress that spilled down to her feet , which were planted with stern posture , along with a velvet like coat of deep purple , almost black itself . her hair , tucked neatly under her hat that was just as unfamiliar as the rest of her , only peaked jarem  s interest . she was out of dress , out of the ordinary , out of the times it seemed . newline newline either way , she was a curious island of deep blues and blacks in a shallow sea of tight greys and offwhite uniforms that had somehow become the normal attire of everyday life . he followed her as she stepped forward again , and heard a faint metallic rustling as the beads of her rosary brushed up against each other . she was clutching the cross with both hands , her arms relaxed down against her womb , a curiously determined grip on the holy symbol . newline newline he could see the top of the crown now , its thin defined angles of gold wrapping the silver beneath it . it bobbed and turned rhythmically as each new person stepped forward to receive the blessing . it still amazed him how accepted and established the faith had become since the overthrow , seventeen years ago . he felt pride in his community , that they were able put aside their contempt and embrace the passive lifestyle of worshipers , realizing that all they are and all the have they owe to the saints of past , as well churches of now , for maintaining the holy practices of peace and adoration . newline newline the overthrow had tried to collapse all of that . lasting three and a half years , it had been the most devastating event since the middle east conflicts , and had sent the world into a hate fueled , blood filled frenzy against all religion . churches , monasteries and places of worship of all kind were brought down by the masses , set to fire with all their history and relics  and more often than not their pastors , ministers , and clergymen  left to the flames and smoke inside . newline newline the true origin that great upheaval was still not fully known to jarem , or most people for that matter , and didn  t seem to be of anybody  s interest either . after all , it wasn  t the cause of it that mattered , it was the result : the peaceful , worryfree life they all now lived . he found it curious that the never wondered at the cause of it all.. newline newline another step forward and he was bathed in sunlight , pouring down through the huge , sevenmeter high windows that lined the cathedral walls . galaxies of dust floated on unseen currents through the light , pollution that would otherwise be unnoticed if not for those illuminating rays . newline newline the air we breathe is contaminated , yet we do not even see it . we take it in without a second thought , not even caring for what it may carry . a sharp sting , a nail in the back of his head suddenly split his thoughts for a second , sending the bile back up and his fingers into tight balls . heavy paranoia filled him , and he thought : poisoned . is the air poisoned ? he was almost frantic , there was something he was forgetting , something he needed to remember , or something he was about to realize , that pulled at him as he struggled to maintain composure . he was so afraid , he wasn  t even sure what he was afraid of , and that just scared him more . newline newline he contemplated turning around and leaving , walking fast before anyone could stop him . he could go lay down somewhere , let his head clear , or get something to eat , perhaps that would help . it wasn  t possible though , he would be shamed and probably taken into custody for refusing communion , seen as a hostile and potentially dangerous individual to reject the practice that had brought them all peace . he didn  t want that , he couldn  t have that , but something primal had been triggered in him , his mind raced without him being able to grasp a thought . he need air , he needed to vomit , to run , to hide , to escape . from what ? what  s wrong with me ? what the fuck is happening ? his foot began to turn , but just as he was about to make his escape that would prove so foolishly futile , he was there . newline newline well , he was almost there . second in the line to be exact . the woman in front of him had just stepped up to the dais , fidgeting with her rosary still , her feet awkwardly shuffling for a few quick moments . she had been looking down since they had begun their procession , but now she lifted her gaze towards the vaulted ceilings above and the cross that hung below them against the back wall . her eyes glistened with the slightest sign of tears , which seemed odd to jarem , as nobody was overly devout these days , everybody was just as dutifully pious as the next person . the tears scared him also , as he was still swimming through currents of opposing and disengaged thoughts . perhaps it was only her unusualness that was scaring him , something he wasn  t used to . for some reason that didn  t seem to be it . newline newline as the priest recited the ceremonial verses and slowly brought out the small , yellow wafer , the woman closed her eyes , tiny rivers slowly tracing the lines of a timeworn , griefridden face , to collect for a moment under the corner of her jaw , before falling to the floor . newline newline  and with this , the bread of the body of christ , you are reborn once again , lifted from the blackness of guilt and defiance , submitted to the light of god and given the gift of honest sight . eat now child , and see the truth that is our lord and savior  newline newline but as the priest lifted the offering to the woman  s mouth , she suddenly became alive . her eyes flicked open , shining with what seemed like rage , and her hands moved with such speed that jarem almost missed the entire event . her age betrayed her though , and the sharpened cross never found its home inside the priest  s body , as he almost instinctively , with ease , caught her arm , twisted until the cross fell to the floor with a steel clang , and her arm as well as her voice cracked . jarem was completely frozen then , though the urge to run was never greater , he couldn  t however move his body for the life of him , or even hold on to a single thought except : what the fuck is going on ? newline newline this thought was more applied to his entire life than the moment currently happening . it was as if he was slowly awaking from a long deep sedation , colors and sounds and sights slowly seeping back into the world and into his mind , trying to regain understanding and a sense of what the fuck really was going on . and as he stood there , unable to move in a crowd of people who seemed to not even notice let alone care for what was happening right in front of them , the woman , on the ground now , clutching her arm and sobbing deeply and mournfully , turned to look at him through eyes of terror and deep sorrow , and the third wave hit him . newline newline this one was in his chest however , not so much his mind , and it all rushed back into him  his thoughts , emotions , memories , his being , drowning him in the overwhelming realization of what had become of it all . his lungs filled to almost bursting as he sucked in the dust filled air , trying to comprehend all that was happening to him , all that had happened to him , to everything . newline then there were hands on his face , and his eyes suddenly focused on the two staring back at his , and the thin , dry smile that was drawn on the priest  s face . a face that seemed soft , yet hard beneath , pudding on the surface and cold steel just behind the slit of a smile . newline newline  jeremiah . i  m always glad to see you here , so obedient , so committed to our cause . he sat in the corner , in the back , pressed up against the vinyl seat in a ragged overcoat and a green knit cap . i  d seen him before , every thursday at 11 a.m. for as long as i  d worked at the diner . he would come in and nod his head toward the waitress and head toward the back . if his booth was taken , he  d make a clean turn and shuffle his way right back out the door . i guess he knew if his table was taken , whatever he was waiting for wouldn  t happen . newline newline yes , i said waiting . every day , when he came in , he  d sit down at the booth and unroll the newspaper wrapped under his arm . he  d do the crossword , the yellow pencil tapping against his gray beard as he wracked his brain for the answers . he  d order coffee in the winter and ice tea in the summer , and he was always pleasant enough . newline newline at 11 , the clock in the iron clock tower in the park across the street would start to chime , and the old man would sit up straight . he  d study the scene outside , wringing his hands and anxiously waiting . he  d check his watch , and if 11:15 came and went , he  d reroll the paper , leave his money on the table , and head out the door , nodding his head toward the staff again as he left . it was always the same , every thursday until the day it wasn  t . newline newline it was slow that morning in september , and the bitter wind drove the customers to their homes and dried leaves through the streets . only two tables were occupied when the man opened the door , the wind clawing its way through my thin uniform and stinging my skin . the man pulled the door closed quickly , rubbed his hands together and nodded my way . i nodded back , grabbed a cup of coffee and followed . newline newline  good morning , joe ,  i said , the cup clicking against the table top .  what would you like today ?  newline newline the old man wrapped his hands around the warm porcelain and scrunched his wrinkled face . newline newline  hash browns and eggs with a side of sausage . i need to warm up a bit today.  newline newline  that wind is killer ,  i said .  i  ll have that right up.  newline newline he nodded and unrolled the newspaper , the same as any other day . newline when he finished his plate , he pushed it back on the table and continued sipping coffee and working on the puzzle . at 11 a.m. , he stiffened and looked out the window onto the deserted street . at 11:06 , he jumped to his feet , sloshing coffee all over the table top . newline i rushed around the counter . his eyes were wild , and he couldn  t stay still . he shifted his weight from one foot to the other . his body was shaking with anticipation . newline newline  is everything ok , joe ?  i asked , reaching out to put my hand on his shoulder . he brushed it off and took two steps toward the door . it flew open with a bang , bringing with it the full force of the wind . dishes clattered on their shelves , and leaves and paper bombarded my freshswept floor . newline a man stood in the doorway , oblivious to the destruction . the bottom of his black trench coat waved violently in the wind , but he stood tall , one hand on his hip , the other pointing a strange weapon directly at joe . newline newline  wh  i started to say , but joe shushed me with one hand , his other pointing a weapon back at the man in black . newline newline  i  ve been waiting for you a long time ,  joe said , in a voice more dangerous than i  d ever heard him use . newline newline  i know.  newline newline both weapons fired at once , and i dropped below the counter , glass showing down upon my back . i crouched , my arms around my head as my diner erupted around me . a shard from a shattered sundae cup sliced into my wrist , but i stayed , locked in position . explosions , cracking and chaos echoed through the tinplated walls , and , for the first time in five years , i prayed . newline newline the noise died , and i heard the familiar click of the door on its hinges . the wind died . footsteps crunched through the debris . they were growing closer . i huddled down , pressing my knees as close to the floor as possible . blood from the cut on my wrist dripped onto the tile floor . newline please , god . i  m not ready to die .  newline newline something soft pressed against the cut , and i squeezed my eyes shut , waiting for the blow or the shot to end it all . the grip around my wrist tugged , pulling me to my feet , and i turned , holding my breath . i looked straight into joe  s familiar green eyes , and i started to cry . my body went limp , and i would have crumpled to the floor if joe hadn  t caught me . newline newline  is everything ok , karen ?  newline newline i looked around the wreckage of the diner and began giggling . i laughed so hard my body shook and tears poured from my eyes . joe continued wrapping the bandage around my wrist . the sirens sounded on the edge of my hearing , and joe froze . he turned my head toward him . newline newline  karen ? i need to know you  re ok.  newline newline i nodded , wiping at my tearstreaked cheeks with the back of my hand . newline  yes , well , no . you know what i mean ?  newline he smiled . newline newline  ok , karen . listen closely . i was here , but i ran when the shooting started , just like the couple at the counter did . that man , over there , in the trench coat , he started shooting up the place then shot himself . i did not come in today . do you understand ?  newline newline red and blue lights reflected off the glass windows of the buildings around us , the sirens screaming down the corridor . i nodded . joe nodded . he pulled a flat , silver box out of his pocket and opened the lid . he handed me an envelope and smiled . i checked the side . it was full of cash . newline newline  thanks for all the great service , karen.  newline newline  you  re  you  re wel  welcome , joe ,  i stuttered . newline newline he pushed a button inside the box , winked , and vanished . i was still standing , dumbstruck , clutching my throbbing wrist , when the cops barged in the door . i never saw joe again . newline newline newline   newline 042the old growth was always a dim , foreboding place . folks around here traded nightmares like old wives  tales , maybe that s how they worked through their fear . i was a bit more analytical than that , though i m certainly not immune to the atmosphere surrounding that forest . and i use forest in the loosest way . it is nt the place you d go for a hike , and certainly not a place to thrive . newline newline which is why it was troubling when my childhood friend gained an inexplicable fascination for that glorified bramble patch , he once told me he wanted to see the heart of it , the oldest of the old growth . being a teenager at the time , i was nt prescient or witty enough to tell him to write a will beforehand , or to use string or breadcrumbs to find his path in the darkness . newline newline he vanished in august of that year , just before school resumed . his parents were despondent , and once it was known that i was likely the last person to see him alive , it fell on my shoulders to explain the unexplainable . i did nt get it then , now it only makes me bitter . newline newline there were no search parties , no grid search , nothing of the sort . the elders simply repeated the tired line ,  the old growth claims its own .  fliers stapled to lightposts deteriorated and vanished as quickly as jason , and as early as that winter he was a rumor to all but his family and closest friends . newline newline maybe it was a quirk of misfortune that i saw something move in the old growth yesterday . it contrasted with the deep earthen tones , and moved fluidly between the gnarled roots of the edge . i felt it stop to study me , which sent a chill up my spine as i turned away . i put it out of my mind last night at the local watering hole with copious amounts of liquid fire . it would have worked too , had i not seen it again . newline newline this time it made it s presence obvious , standing atop one of the thickest roots , facing away but seemingly aware of my focus . i could see it sway in the breeze , and for a moment i thought it was an animal , before it walked to the highest point of the root , giving away it s form against the graying sky . newline newline a chill ran up my spine when i thought of jason , and this thing turned its head toward me as if he heard me whisper his name . it reached down with one arm , and swung down into the underbrush , in a display that will haunt me until the end of my days . its arm was more a collection of tangled vines , it stretched as the lump descended out of sight , and as the disfigured appendage released its grip , i heard my name , sharply . at that moment i saw the root pulse with energy , it glimmered with a faint but deep crimson . i wasted no time in retreat , and to be fair i m still shaking like a leaf . newline newline the old growth claims its own . i do nt know how that phrase came to be , or what it may signify . all i know is that my train leaves in an hour , everything i cherish is clumsily packed in two bags . this might be the most reckless , hasty decision i ve ever made but i need to make distance . i hope to never see that foul place again . why do you kill ?  newline newline toby lay on the floor allowing his inner monologue to wander for a moment , as it usually does when the sun is high in the sky , shining through the gap in the curtains . why indeed ? newline newline was he taught how to do it ? was it a bad upbringing that drove him to murder ? doubtful . he lived a life of luxury ever since he was brought home . he had affection from his family , and offered it back in spades . no real unhappy moments as far as he could remember . he certainly did nt do it in desperation , as he had all the food , drink , and company anyone could ever hope for . newline newline was it to protect what was rightfully his ? again , not the right answer . he and his family did not have any major threats . sure , the occasional accident on the nearby roads could be considered a liability , but it was out of his control . no real enemies , at least none that could be a real danger . besides , he kept a look out all the time , watching over the neighbors and making sure nothing strange happened . mrs jenkins across the road did pass away a few months ago , but that had nothing to do do with him . probably nothing to do with him . maybe . newline newline he shook his foot to stop an itch , caused by the sun slowly creeping up his leg as he pondered . newline newline the question remained . why ? what caused him to stalk around , looking for prey ? why did he take innocent victims from their families , brought them home , and pulled their intestines out ? the macabre display that his loved ones reviled , but tolerated . newline newline the thought conjured up his most recent kill . a small body that was difficult to catch , but it was not nimble enough to get away from toby s finelyhoned physique and techniques . he relived the feelings of those few seconds of slaughter . happiness . satisfaction . a feeling of release . newline newline the sun started to dazzle toby , warming his face and telling him to get up . newline newline his memory stirred something inside him . he had a compulsion to do it again . to leave the house . to find another soontobe artwork for him to lay on the floor . newline newline he found the answer to his own question .  because i can ,  he told himself .  because i m good at

for financial reasons only . and while i can pay my bills now , i m still not sure if it was worth it . newline newline just to give an example of how horrendous this neighborhood is : there s this asshole in a yellow car that always drives around every morning and stops in front of my house . i m honestly worried for my safety , what could he possibly be doing ? scouting out a burglary ? in addition to this , i m pretty sure that guy s a pedophile . newline newline the worst part , however , is my neighbor . my neighbor is the most annoying and disgusting person you ll ever lay your eyes upon . this hairy monstrosity is always yelling about , usually from his porch or front lawn , and i can hear it from my bedroom . he will not shut up . ever . to be honest , i m not sure how i could have survived this town if i had nt met tom . newline newline tom s a lovely guy . he comes over for brunch everyday and we talk for hours . we agree on everything , how annoying kids are , how annoying the neighbor is , how disgusting this neighborhood looks . i never seem to notice him come in , but every time i come down from my bedroom for brunch , he s sitting there waiting for me . newline newline on this particular day , i walk down the stairs , greet tom , and begin to make some toast . tom never really eats while he s there , it s mainly just me . newline newline  how s it going , george ?  he asks . newline newline  horrible . the neighbor wo nt shut up . i ca nt get sleep .  newline newline  me neither ,  said tom . it just occurred to me that i had no idea where tom lived .  do nt you think someone should just off him ?  newline newline  would nt that be nice .  newline newline  hey , do nt you have a few guns in your basement ?  newline newline i do nt know how he knew this , since i had never shown him around my house . he probably just looked around before i came downstairs . newline newline  yeah , i do . maybe i should take this matter into my own hands .  newline newline i walked down the stairs into the basement and grabbed a shotgun . by the time i had gotten back up , tom had left . no matter , i began to walk to the door , which tom had somehow locked behind him , and walked out of the house . newline newline as soon as my fatass neighbor had spotted me he began screaming , yelling , barking . the hairy creature was practically crawling around in his yard just making incomprehensible noises . i raised the gun and pulled the trigger without hesitation , i was so full of rage . the body went flying across the yard . i smiled and returned to my home . newline newline tom was always right with these kinds of things . newline newline   newline newline to see all of my writing , please visit rzachwrites !in the darkness of space , it slumbered . it s few moments of activity  centuries for lesser creatures  had seen the selfdestruction of countless species , as even a glimpse of its very presence drew observers insane . what mortals that knew of its existence kept away from the void it called home , shunning it as a place of madness and death . as such , it slept a peaceful , dreamless rest . newline newline but an unheard sound penetrated this sphere of tranquil chaos . a frequency unnatural to the signals that normally pervaded it s domain .  images   http : imgur.comau4b9s6  swirled within it s thoughts as it unscrambled the signal . a primitive numerical system . the atomic makeup of deoxyribonucleic acid . an image of a faroff solar system . and , brightest of all , a graphic of the signal s creators , a bipedal species . newline newline all this entered the mind of it , and filled it with the desire to visit the naive , simple species that transmitted such a message . it would take a long time to arrive , but it had time . and so , it awoke . john , meet betty . betty , john .  athan was proud to introduce his two friends that he knew so well . he was surprised when john first said he never met betty . athan was friends with these two for so long , how is it that they never met ? he figured carl s new year s party was a good place to allow these two dear friends to meet . creating a new connection for someone always gave athan a sense of pride . newline newline  athan , where is she ?  newline newline  this some sort of joke ? ai nt nobody here .  betty inquired . newline newline athan had secluded his two companions in the living room where nobody would bother them . he wanted these two to get to know each other very well . it seemed important to athan , these were the two most important people in his life after all . newline newline  stop playing games you two . i know you guys are probably pretty nervous about meeting someone new but i know you ll hit it off . you have a lot in common !  newline newline  athan , it s just you and me here . there is nobody else .  newline newline  whatr you talkin  about ? it s just youn me !  newline newline athan had a sinking feeling in his stomach . why would nt they talk to each other ? both of them knew everything there was to know about athan , his fears , his desires , even his most embarrassing moments . surely , if they had nothing to relate about , they could at least talk about him . newline newline  oh shut up you two . do you guys remember that one time when i threw up at that christmas party last year ?  newline newline  then you tried to flush the toilet and it clogged up and shit and puke got all over the floor ! lucky for you i was there to help clean it up .  john recalled . newline newline  of course i member . i was there !  newline newline athan laughed at the memory . for the rest of the night , athan and his two best friends reminisced about his most harrowing and embarrassing experiences . he chalked up the lack of direct communication between the two to social anxiety . not a problem he thought , he was just glad that he could be there to act as social lubricant . the meetup , in his mind , was a success . newline newline as athan was throughly enjoying himself in the living room , carl and his arm candy strolled in looking for a place to exchange fluids . athan was too entertained to notice . newline newline  what is he doing ?  newline newline carl looked at his once dear friend . he invited him to the party in a hope that he would try to get himself out of his depression . a depression that was present for as long as carl had known athan , which was almost all his life . it was clear that his plan did not work out . he feared that maybe he was exacerbating his condition by inviting him . however , for carl , his conscious was quickly pushed aside by the beautiful blonde on his arm . newline newline  do nt worry about him . let s go upstairs .  newline newline newline newlinethey were sat on the edge of the universe , looking out over all of creation and yet she had never felt smaller . a billion suns flared into existence in the time it took for her to wipe at her eyes . newline newline  i d forgotten what it was like , to be among them ,  she said . newline newline  and what did you remember young one ?  newline newline  they live such fleeting lives . born into pain , so many mouths , so many souls , lost to nothingness .  newline newline  is that what you saw ?  newline newline she turned to look at him , saw the stars reflected in his blind eyes and yet she knew he saw more in the blackness of time than she would see in a trillion lifetimes . he smiled . the corner of his mouth twitching upwards as memories played out across his flesh like comets streaking across the heavens . newline newline  i see a thousand new lives beginning with every beat of the universe s heart . i see civilisations breaking free from the bonds of their planets . i see life , and death , and know that all the things we have made are stronger for it .  newline newline he held her hand and she watched the memories danced between their fingertips . only the taste . only the barest notion of what he felt . but it was enough . she wept once more . newline newline  you think , life has to be harsh ,  he said .  but look at me , and tell me the universe is not a more beautiful thing for having shared it with them . it was stupid , so very stupid . i knew not to pick up hitchhikers , but i did it anyways . now here i am , a fivefootfive girl , with a creepy sixfoot stranger riding in my car . newline newline he s bulky , with a heavy coat and five oclock shadow . he s also pointing a gun at me with one hand . that is kind of the thing that makes me an idiot . newline newline i do nt have anything on hand for self defense . newline newline instead i ve got one hand on the wheel as i navigate the road , my other hand in his lap giving him ... well ... this night is nt going to be looked on fondly if i get out alive . newline newline  faster , bitch !  newline newline he punctuates with a rough tap of the gunpoint against my temple . i fight back tears of fright . i do nt know whether to speed up the car or my hand , so i do both . newline newline as he groans and laughs , my mind races to try and figure out a solution to my predicament . that s when i see the guardrail coming up and inspiration hits . newline newline he s not even watching the road . i swerve to the side , momentarily jarring him back to his senses as i pull my hand back . he starts to cuss my out , but the sudden intrusion of the guardrail through his body and face silence him . newline newline i do nt remember anything else before the sirens approaching . the airbag busted my nose pretty good . i cry , and i m a blubbering mess when the police and ambulance arrive . newline newline i give my statement to the police while being patched up . broken nose , bruised ribs , a dislocated shoulder . a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders . newline newline insurance did nt want to cover my car at first . they claimed i was lying . it took a month for the police to locate his gun and prove my story . newline newline and now i ve invested in pepper spray and a taser . you can  t ,  she cried , while struggling to force up words through her sobbing .  please don  t . you won  t make it back !  newline  we made it here didn  t we ?  i said , trying to sound as sure of myself as i could , even though i wasn  t . newline  we almost didn  t though , and they  ll catch you ! they  ll catch you just like they caught lucas and i  ll be all alone.  she started to convulse then . i could tell she was about to have another episode . lucas could have calmed her down , but lucas was probably dead and i was just as lost without my big brother as daisy was  i couldn  t let that show . newline i sat down next to her on the pile of cardboard boxes that had served as our bed and separated us from the cement floor of the factory that was our refuge from the war outside . then i wrapped her small starving figure in my arms and said ,  daisy , listen to me . i know you  re scared . i won  t lie , i  m scared too . but we haven  t eaten in four days . if we just stay here we  ll die just the same as we would if we didn  t have a place to hide . i have to go get food and i promise you i will come back.  newline  let me come with you then ! i can help . i promise i  ll do what you tell  newline  no , daisy ,  i cut her off . part of me was actually considering taking her with me , but that  s not what luke would  ve done  it  s not what he did . it had been two and a half weeks since we  d lost him . we were staying in an abandoned 711 and he  d gone out to find gas for the car . daisy didn  t know it , but i  d found him a block away with the back of his head blown off . since then i  d had to make all the decisions , and all i could do was roll the dice and hope this was the right one . newline i grabbed her gently by the chin and turned her teary eyes that were swimming with more grief than any nine year old should ever know towards mine and said ,  i love you ,  before i got up and went the door . newline i cracked open the door that opened up to an alley between the factory and the building next store and peeked my head outside . a thought came to me that god had simply hit the pause button on the world . the streets were packed with cars that would have at one time zipped by this shitty warehouse , but now stood stagnant outside its doors forevermore . it was eerie how similar this new world appeared to the old one sometimes , but it wasn  t . in the old world this slum of detroit was one of the most dangerous places in the whole state . in the new world , it was the safest place we  d found since we  d escaped from the camp . newline i crept up slowly towards the street and sat for a moment behind an overturned dumpster , waiting for any sign of life . besides the everpresent thrum of explosions on the horizon , i neither heard nor saw anything of alarm . i knew that if i could make it up the street about a quarter mile to the parking garage , i  d be able to cut through alleys to the supermarket we  d seen the night we found the factory . to get there , though , my only option would be to run up the middle of the street exposed . i started at a brisk walk . i made it ten feet , then twenty , then thirty , and just then i heard the roar of an engine up above me approaching . newline i  ll never regret anything more than not turning back then . instead i broke out into a sprint towards the garage . when i was halfway i could tell by the growing sound of the plane that it was going to pass right over me . i was so close then , just another twenty feet ! i dived into the safety of the garage just as the shadow of the plane past over the street , and the rumble of its engine died away . i sat for just a second in the ecstasy of relief , but only for a second . then i heard the plane coming back . newline  boom ! ... boom ! ... boom !  newline  no , no , no , no , no  was all my brain could formulate as the blasts grew louder up the street ahead of me and billows of dust rose up from the ground . newline  boom ! ... boom ! ... boom !  newline  nooooooo !  i screamed , while covering my face from the debris as the bombing passed by in front of me , deafening my scream and everything else except the resounding sound of doom . newline  boom ! ... boom ! ... boom !  newline and then it was over . i inhaled a cloud of dust and forced myself to my feet from behind the pillar that sheltered me from the bombs . my ears were ringing and my thoughts became slow and strange . i stumbled into the street before falling to my knees . the bombs had leveled the entire block across the street . i scanned my gaze from right to left at one pile of rubble after another , before becoming fixated on the pile at the end of the street . daisy was a part of that pile . newlinethe wind was ferocious today , cutting through the layers of warm clothing and whipping hair about in a frenzy . not even superglue could have kept your hairstyle in check up here . the 30 stories between the rooftop and the were quite obvious from this angle , especially with a sense of vertigo flowing through them . two men sat on the edge of the building , trying to have a conversation through the screaming of the wind . newline newline  but why ?  newline newline robert had been thinking about this question for a while now . there were too many answers . his childhood ? lack of family ? perhaps the fact he was stuck in a dead end job ? maybe there was just no answer at all , maybe he just was nt meant to be alive . he was an accidental child after all . his mother had to put her career on hold , his father was a junkie one time hookup . he knew what he was and he had no compunctions talking about it , but explaining why he wanted to die was nt the easiest of explanations . even talking to shrinks in the past he never had a good answer . mostly it d be something like  i do nt want to live anymore  which would immediately be followed by the question again . it was frustrating . it felt like some child who was just asking the same word over and over again . felt like a road trip where  are we there yet ?  was the only thing uttered from the backseat . newline newline  newline newline craig was looking at robert intently . his fear of robert slipping over the edge was palpable , but he knew if he tied him up in conversation for long enough maybe he could help him somehow . just the way he was , he guessed . always the type to help , never the type to say no . if you needed a shoulder , craig was there . if you needed a lift , craig and his truck were there . but this time he was nt sure he could do anything . maybe just hear the last few words that robert had to say . they were nt friends for very long , maybe a few months total , but he had seen the pain inside . that look of agony that would spread across his face when robert thought no one was looking . the same look that evaporated the second that he noticed someone around . newline newline a shrug . that s all he was able to pry out of him . just a singular shrug . newline newline  oh come on rob , you ca nt do that to me . if you want to die , i get that . i ca nt understand it but i know you re in pain . i do nt want you to die , and i ll do my best to make sure that does nt happen if i can help it , but i want an answer if you re going to do this to me .  newline newline there was another long pause and craig kept staring . a couple of drops fell from robs face , heavy sigh audible over the whirling wind . newline newline  newline newline his chest was hurting . a spidery pain , his heart aching . the shrug was the only thing he could come out with that did nt sound overly melodramatic or pathetic , but there was a quote echoing through his head . a metaphor that was accurate , but a bit contrite . newline newline  no use in watering dead flowers .  newline newline he looked up from his feet , and the street below , and at craigs face . they locked eyes for a moment , then craig leaned back . both still stuck in thought . newline newline  newline newline craig stood up . he walked up behind rob and hugged him tight . he could feel his pulse racing , not as fast as roberts . while holding him he said the only thing he could think of . newline newline  i love you . we have nt known each other long but you re a good guy . you care about others , you try to help , you do what you can . i know you hurt , i know you ve been through a lot , but i want to see you tomorrow . i want to try to help you and i want to make your life worth living . that being said , i know that you do nt want to anymore . this is left up to you . i m not going to drag you off the edge , i m not going to force you to live . this is your decision . but i hope more than anything that i get a call from you tomorrow . i love you rob .  newline newline he squeezed tight and then let go , backing up . he could see rob shake , not able to hear sobs through the wind but knowing what was happening . tears started to roll down his cheek as well . as he turned to walk away , the wind started to die . each step towards the door he could hear his feet crunch on the weird rooftop gravel below . the hinges on the door squeaked . he heard a couple more sniffles , then , as the door was closing behind him , the sound of jeans on concrete as rob pushed himself over the edge .it was nt enough for her to just sit there and finish her report . no . she had to just move her bangs to the side ever so slightly while i happened to glance by . i am trying to work here and there she is messing up my rhythm . everyday , i would wake up , go to work , and go back home . now i m all  stop sneezing like a baby kitten !  or  do nt hum the lyrics to king of anything while pretending the keyboard is a piano !  the worst part is when i take my coffee break and shes there trying to make small talk ,  sooooo what do you plan on doing tonight joey jojoson ?  my last name is not jojoson ! furthermore it is my life , she does nt need to know what i do when i m home . she invited me to dinner last weekend and when i said why she said ,  because ... ..because ... i am new in town and would like soooommmmmeeee ... .pointers ! yes . pointers . most people don  t realize that all the myths and legends are true , or at least they will be . the hall collects the stories of its weapons and scatters them back through time so that everyone knows of their might . newline newline some of the weapons united kingdoms , like that shining blade embedded in stone . others taught a lesson , like that sword on the far wall , still hanging by a single hair . newline newline that hammer of lightning on a central pedestal won  t be used for another ten thousand years . the story of the genetically enhanced super human that will wield it , so farfetched that we attribute it to an ancient god . newline newline they all have one thing in common though , stories . stories both big and small , from whenever in time that they finally see use . all of them except for one . one small orb , black as night and speckled with stardust , has no history . no past , present or future to be told , except for this . newline newline this one tiny story is all anyone will even know of the small stone that will change the world , and it had chosen me to be its wielder . i will not be a hero , i will not be remembered , but i will save you all .

grab a can of coke . it s sweating in the july heat , the cold perspiration dripping down my arm . i gently press it against the back of my neck to cool off while i flip the burgers .  how do you want them ?  i yell to my wife , her parents , and our kids even though i already know . we ve had 4th of july barbecues since we got married 6 years ago . i flip the burgers and pop the tab on my can . a loud pack sound and then a long low hiss as the fizz escapes .  krisssssten .  i swear i could hear my wife s name in the fizz . i dig a pinky finger into my ear and root around to remove any excess wax , but of course there was nt any . i never go a day without cleaning ear canals . they get infected easily , you know . newline newline i bring the can up to my mouth to take a sip and i hear the bubbles of carbonation popping again .  bobby ,  i can hear over and over in the pops . i swivel my head around just in time to see my son chase a rolling hula hoop into the street . newline newline  bobby !  kristen yells as she darts after him . before i could move , a car flung around the corner . she covered his tiny body with hers , but her frail frame did nt do much good . newline newline  kris ! bobby !  i scream and run towards the bodies in the street . in my haste , i drop the can of coke and it crashes down hard . it rolls in a circle , spilling the rest of the brown soda down my driveway until it meets the red blood .people pay big money to pick how they re killed . sword , car , gun . anything powerful . they keep record of how a person is killed , because if you can reincarnate and find who you were previously , you may have an inheritance waiting for you . newline newline here is what they do nt tell you . no one can guarantee when you will be brought back .  it could be three days or three hundred years from your death . and you know what ? technology changes .  newline newline it turns out i was a fearsome chief of an extinct island tribe back in the day . i was mortally wounded in battle and requested our shaman to end my life with our most powerful weapon  a sling of coconuts . how was i supposed to know i would nt be back for two thousand years ? ! how was i supposed to know technology would change so drastically ? newline newline because of my poor choice , finding a mate , a job , or any sort of social standing , has been nearly impossible . i

this is nt too odd , i just typed this up on my ipad !it  s a big hit at parties . his birthday arrives just a few weeks after he moves in , and as soon as the cake is cut and the champagne bottle popped , they all drag chairs to the patio door and watch . on new year  s eve , john sets up the fireworks in the backyard while everyone else outside peers through the glass , trying to see the ball drop in 1963 on the tiny television set in the old couple  s kitchen . by the time st. patrick  s day rolls around , john  s buddies have devised a drinking game . take a sip if the old lady is knitting . another sip if her husband dozes off in the chair . chug if she kicks him under the table to wake him . newline newline easter weekend , margot and her kids drive up from indiana . cold still clings to the air , but by sunday morning the sun is shining , the grass brown but alive beneath patches of snow . john and margot sit at the kitchen table , their chairs turned to the sliding glass doors , watching john  s nephews play in the yard through one door and the old couple host easter brunch through the other . newline newline  how old do you think they are ?  newline newline john shrugs , blowing on his coffee .  i  d sayseventies , maybe ? there must be three generations out there.  he squints , scanning the backyard through the slowglass door . the skies arewerecloudy in 1963 , threatening rain , and yet at least thirty people are gathered outside , the ladies in dresses and elaborate hats and the men in shirts and ties . newline newline  i don  t know . people got married and had kids a lot earlier in those days.  newline newline  i  d still say seventies . fred has a cane , he  s definitely up there in years.  newline newline margot looks at him .  fred ?  newline newline  i got tired of calling him  old guy.   newline newline she gives him a wry smile .  and the woman ?  newline newline  ethel.  newline newline margot laughs .  you  ve got the wrong decade , john . i love lucy was in the fifties.  newline newline  close enough ,  john says , and drinks his coffee . newline newline   newline newline as the nights grow milder , john spends more time on the back patio , watching the slowglass from the outside in . eventually he buys a patio set at a garage sale and takes to eating dinner outside , grading math tests to the sound of crickets while ethel knits and fred combs through the newspaper . newline newline he doesn  t notice anything is wrong until a few days after it must have happened . thunderstorms keep him inside for the better part of a weekand though it means he gets to enjoy torrential downpours in one pane of glass and cloudless nights in the other , he misses his fred and ethel . finally , on a friday , the skies clear , and john spends the weekend outdoors , watching for the old couple . soon , though , john realizes that ethel is the only one home . newline newline she eats alone . she knits alone , fingers pausing now and then as her gaze drifts to the floor . a few days every week , a woman john recognizes from the easter party shows up , bustling around the kitchen , washing dishes , chattering about something that draws the occasional halfhearted smile out of ethel but little else . newline newline more and more often , ethel  s eyes lift to the slowglass . she and her husband never paid much attention to the sliding glass doorjohn suspected early on that they had lived in the house for so many years that the slowglass had become less of a marvel to them . but now , ethel watches the glass the way she and fred used to watch the andy griffith show , hands idle in her lap , focus fixated on whatever view she has of the past . john gazes back at her , watching her eyes flicker . newline newline fifty years back for her . 1913 .  how long have you lived here ?  john asks , trailing a finger down the glass .  what do you see ?  newline newline in midjune , john wanders out to the patio after dark and finds fred and ethel  s kitchen packed up in boxes . his heart sinks . on the last day of the month , john catches her with the final box from the kitchen in her arms , standing where the dinner table used to be . she looks at the slowglass , and with a heavy sigh , says something . john can  t hear her , of course , nor can he make out what she says . but as she leaves the kitchen , john waves at her , his throat tight .  bye , ethel ,  he says , and then sits down to finish his dinner . newline newline   newline newline weeks pass , then months . the house in 1963 remains empty , and john prepares for the new school year . the first week of classes brings sweltering heat and a broken ac system  john envies the thunderstorms wailing through 1963 , puddles dappling the lawn like spots on a dalmatian . newline newline he doesn  t meet the new homeowners until well into september . john is lugging the lawn mower out of the shed when he turns around and finds a girl staring back at him through the slowglass . she  s younger than john , maybe eighteen , dark hair looped behind her ears and loose around her shoulders . john abandons the mower and climbs the steps to the patio , approaching the glass until he and the girl are face to face . newline newline he recognizes the wonderment in her eyes , smiles at it . is that how he looked , the first time he saw the slowglass ? something makes her laugh , and she spins around , gesturing at a woman by the sinkher mother , judging by the resemblance . the older woman comes to the door , standing behind the girl and placing her hands on her shoulders . john watches them speak silently to one another , wishing he were better at reading lips . in time , the mother leaves , unpinning her hair as she heads toward the living room . but the girl stays , sliding into a chair by the kitchen table and gazing raptly at the glass door . newline newline  have you given her a name yet ?  margot asks the next weekend over the phone . newline newline  don  t need to . she gets letters in the mail all the time and opens them at the kitchen table.  john glances up from his lesson plan and watches the girl set the table while her mother cooks .  bonnie baker.  newline newline margot hums a note of approval .  well , now you have her name , address , and the year she moved in . you could totally find her on an ancestry site or something , if you wanted to.  newline newline  i guess so.  john leans back in the patio chair .  i  m not sure i want to . there  s something special about getting to know her firsthand like this , you know ?  newline newline   newline newline  this got longer than i was expecting , whoops . to be continued !  newline it s almost mechanical  i thought to myself sitting in my tree . newline newline most people avoid my mountain from all the stories , both fact and fiction , and yet this woman came just to become a story . that s all she could be here for . what better place to commit premeditated murder than a place where people have recently been dissappearing anyway ? newline newline  jesus another already ?  i wondered aloud this time . i had assumed from the speed and anger in her when she had found her first victim , that she had known him . that the act had been a long time coming . yet she killed him , drug him off into the bushes and just sat laid back down in an awkward heap slightly off the path . newline newline i had already watched her stab one person . why not stay for a second ? but it was , again , over much too quick . she had just laid there . waiting . with my scope i was able to see her breathing . chest rising and falling in an even rhythm . no stress at all having just killed someone . waiting . newline newline she stabbed this one in the arm first . i think she was worried he could hold her down if she did nt eliminate him as a threat before eliminating him as a life . it shows she s smart , but willing to put herself in danger . i guess i already knew the latter since she was here in the first place . there s too much blood on the path for a third victim though . will she move lower down the mountain on the path and ... newline newline she s laying in the pool of blood . oh my god it s beautiful and brilliant . that just emphasizes the image of her needing help . someones coming up the path . she s still breathing just fine . he s seen her . i m taking the shot .stephanie is not a fan of school . she has been here all of two hours , and already she knows that she will hate it . the school is in the city , one of the massive public schools , with hundreds and hundreds of other kids . it is nt nice and open , like home . newline newline at home , there are cartoons and toys , and she can color whenever she wants to . here , she is expected to sit quietly , and she gets put in the corner if she plays with toys . it is nt fair . she tried defiance , planting her fat little fists on her hips , but to no avail . mrs. rowantree is a meany , and she just picked her up and planted stephanie in the corner to watch the wall . newline newline stephanie hates the corner . she glances behind her and sees mrs. rowantree reading the newspaper . the mean old lady s face is safely hidden behind a picture of gerald ford s smiling face , and another silly one of the president falling down a flight of

they re engrossed in drawing pictures of what they want to be when they grow up . the toys on the opposite end of the room . newline newline slowly , trying to avoid mrs. rowantree s nasty gaze , she sneaks across the room toward a fire truck that catches her eye . stephanie bends down , pulls the engine back and forth , smiling at the way the wheels squeak gently in the toy . newline newline she lifts the engine to examine the underside , then abruptly stops as mrs rowantree grabs her by the hair . newline newline  what did i tell you ? you are in time out !  newline newline stephanie scowls , and fights back .  no ! i m not done playing yet !  newline newline  young lady , i will fetch the paddle . do nt think that i wo nt !  newline newline  no !  newline newline mrs. rowantree smacks stephanie across the back of the head . she bites down hard on her tongue . newline newline stephanie tries to yell ,  not yet !  but the words are marbled by her bleeding tongue . what comes out is ,  natchyetste !  newline newline to her amazement , mrs rowantree promptly lets her go . stephanie watches as the mean old teacher walks to her desk and pulls out a little blinky pen . newline newline the other children glance up from their coloring , perplexed . mrs rowantree opens her mouth , a vague smile on her middle aged face . she says , almost sweetly ,  nasdarov rodina .  she presses the blinky pen , and suddenly , her desk is gone . mrs. rowantree is gone . an entire wing of the school is gone , engulfed in fire . newline newline  newline newline  so what happened , here ?  newline newline detective harper looks up from his gristly work , into the dead eyes of the school s middle aged principle . both of the , are covered in black ash . neither one of them is willing to admit to what that ash might once of been . newline newline  so far as i can tell , a lot of plastic explosives , stan . looks like enough to have leveled ten schools , easily . epicenter looks like it was at rowantree s room .  newline newline  but what was she hoping to accomplish ? and why the overkill ?  newline newline harper shrugged .  i do nt know . but we re lucky . if she d had the time to plant those explosives around the rest of the school , in more key places , she could have easily killed everyone , not just the population of the c wing . and she still would have had a tremendous amount to spare .  newline newline  she ? you think one of my teachers was responsible for this , harper ?  the principle is outraged . through the soot , harper can see small flecks of angry , red skin . harper sighs . newline newline  i do nt know what to think , stan . but i do know that our files one cynthia rowantree show that she disappeared for three months in august of last year . her only family was in the city , and there was zero contact with her . nobody knows where she was for those three months . stan , i do nt think it s out of the question that something was done to her in that time . i think she had a mission .  newline newline  ok , but why blow up one wing of the school ? that seems ... i do nt want to say lackluster ,  but it seems like a poor return on the resources to make a woman attack america .  newline newline harper offered a helpless shrug .  i do nt know . the size of the explosion suggests that she had other targets , other plans . but something made them detonate early . maybe an electrical malfunction ? maybe a bad day with the children ? it could be a million different things .  newline newline stan sighed heavily .  it s a high price to pay , jack ... an entire wing of the school . 312 children and teachers are dead . and i hired her . that blood is forever on my hands .  newline newline harper put a hand on the man s shoulder ,  you could nt have known , stan . anyone who was sweeping teachers for plastic explosives on a daily basis ... i d ship him off and call him mad any day of the week .  newline newline stan nodded .  that s not what their parents will say .  he swallowed heavily .  it s not what those kids have been saying in my head , every night since this happened . it s not what lisa said when she left me , and it s damn well not what the congressional hearing will determine when this is all over .  newline newline harper withdrew his hand , wrung it helplessly in his other .  for what it s worth , i m sorry , stan . i truly am . but this could have been so much worse . at the end of the day , we ve just got to be thankful for the fact that this was nt bigger .  newline newline  i guess so , jack .  a lone tear streaked down stan s face , cleaning the ash from his features as it did so .  i guess so .  hi . uh , kratzhlir ? did we translate that right ?  newline  how did you get this frequency ?  newline  off one of the dead scouts we killed . we also managed to intercept your strategic overview .  newline  you lie . you pathetic humans do nt have the ability or cunning to do such a thing .  newline  be that as it may , when we translated it , we came across some things that we may have misinterpreted .  newline  your puny human brains can not comprehend the telegorth language  newline  it says here , to kill all humans , and then steal all their atmospheric carbon dioxide  newline  that is correct human . impressive  newline  yeah , so , did you know that humans are responsible for the abundant co2 levels in our atmosphere ?  newline  what ? ! first science officer kertgat ! come here !  newline  sir ?  newline  did you know humans produce carbon dioxide ?  newline  yes sir . it s in the 900 page dossier on the human race . you did nt read it ?  newline  who has time for 900 pages ? i was busy killing humans  newline  yes , i see , sir . but killing humans actually hurts us in the long run since they are so good at producing co2 .  newline  so i should stop killing humans ?  newline  it would seem prudent  newline  i see . i guess we should withdraw the troops .  newline  very well sir  newline  human ! are you still there ?  newline  yup .  newline  it seems we are at an impasse . what do you want for your co2 ?  newline  what do you got ?  newline  200 space bucks , and a 50  off coupon to space denny s  newline  let me check with the earth council ... .they say yes .  newline  very well human the glaring red numbers ticked down with the cadence of a beating heart . each pulse of light washed across my face like ocean waves , each with what felt like a hammer . newline newline my time . newline newline it was nt enough that i gave up most of my life fighting in the agarian wars , it was nt enough that i had given up flesh for them , and after all that the medals in the box by my bed did nt really mean shit . the numbers ticked down . newline newline i perused the room to make sure i did nt leave anything behind . not a whole lot mattered except those damn numbers on my arm . the chip in my hand activated the door and it slid away , a quiet hiss following it s exit . i took a moment to glance down the metal halls to confirm that they were empty . officer deck did have it s privileges , including access to the jet deck . i did not have much time left , both because they were tracking me and it was literally running out . newline newline moving quickly through the dimmed florescent lighting i hoped that the clanging of my boots would nt reverberate too far . slipping through the shadows and the bulkheads i moved toward my goal where lamy was waiting . the woman claimed she loved me , but we would see how far that would go tonight . though she was more than 45000 hours my junior , i had grown fond of her . newline newline a familiar discordant rhythm sounded in the distance . peacekeepers . breaking into a run i heard them marching in the distance , to me or my room , i was unsure , but best not to risk it . abandoning stealth , i ran to the jet deck . newline newline  lamy ?  i whispered loudly , wandering around the silent sentinels . i needed her for access to the damn birds . idly i noted only a fifteenth of an hour remaining on my time . so low . my pulse quickened , far faster than the pulsing light that created garish shadows along the smooth aerodynamic lines of the jets . newline newline  lamy ? !  the whisper came out louder , harsher , and echoed back to me . a hand covered my mouth and pulled me into the darkness . the hand became lips and that was all that was needed to pull me in . she pulled away and turned on small hand light , giving me a toothy grin . her normally neat brown hair was tussled , jump suit askew . eyes matching her hair color looked me over from below a forehead slightly too wide , above a nose slight too broad for her to be called pretty . newline newline she hit me .  have a baby ? i ve been waiting down here long enough for you to .  newline newline  good to see you too , lamy , now give me the code so i can get out of here .  newline newline  you were making so much noise you would nt hear a agar sneak up on you .  newline newline i grunted . not a pleasant thought . 45 meters in height with long dorsal appendages that ended with claws that cut through hardened armor and jaws that savored human flesh . i had given a lifetime , and a hand , fending them off colonies . i hoped the fucker enjoyed eating it in his last moments . i robbed him of the chance to follow me around like hook s crocodile , which agars were said to do even through deadness of vacuum . newline newline she waved her hand and the bay opened in the back of an old cargo jet . colloquially called free birds . nice touch . newline newline  where the hell did you dig up this fossil ?  i asked . newline newline  lower bays .  she replied as she climbed up .  now hurry up , they probably noticed you re not doing your ritual autocanoodling by now .  i rolled my eyes at her back side . reaching up i noticed my time was all zeros . no longer flashing , but fading . disconcerted i climbed up and noted the spartan cargo bay straight to the cockpit where lamy was seated . utility at it s finest . i walked up to her , and saw that she was strapped in . newline newline  what are you doing ?  newline newline  i m coming .  the tone chipper as always . newline newline  the hell you are , you re already risking enough getting this bird for me . you could be exiled for that alone . anything more is execution .  i tried to drive the severity to her . newline newline  i m . coming .  her tone brokered no argument . she stopped what she was doing , blinking lights flashing in her eyes , and fixed me with a glare . i leaned over her and started undoing her straps . newline newline  no .  newline newline she slapped me , and started to redo her straps . i picked her up before she could finish what she was doing and started walking to the back of the ship . she started kicking and screaming when i heard a sound that grabbed my chest . peacekeepers . they were here . newline newline  it does nt matter now , let s go .  i hit the seal button on the cargo bay door , agonizing how slowly it shut . lamy and i ran to the front newline eschewing the rest of the preflight checks . the ship rumbled to life , and my seat was vibrating which made my back itch . i hit the throttle and made for the outgang . newline newline  wait . the doors !  newline newline i slipped the bird through them as they siphoned shut . a straight away lead to freedom . newline newline  weapons ?  i inquired . newline newline  packer rockets .  newline newline i raised an eyebrow . this was going to fun with that kind of ordinance . i flipped on the arming keys and blood dripped down my nose . lamy s slap ? probably . i guess i really was getting soft . rockets spiraled ahead in the artificial atmosphere , followed by smoke trails . half way to the target the rockets split into dozens of smaller streams and increased velocity . probably overkill for a door , but it was going to look spectacular . newline newline i felt the vibrations from the explosions rather than hearing them . the smoke trails reversed direction as they were sucked out into the vacuum . home free . all this excitement was actually making me feel dizzy ! we blew out with the missile debris , i did nt even realize i was hold my breath . newline newline freedom . newline newline newline  where should we go ? sector 3458 ? 4112 ?  lamy asked me . i still felt like i had a fog about my mind , which made it hard to think . i answered with a passionate kiss . newline newline  ow ! you bit me ! .  i blinked in surprise , i had nt realized . my back was really feeling like it was itching now , what was wrong with these chairs ? newline newline  hello , asshole ! did you hear me ?  i did and i did nt , my head was ringing , and a i felt a pulsing pull , reminiscent of my time running down . not gone after all . a stinging in my face pulled me back and i realized lamy hit me again . i began to admonish her when the itching in my back turned to tearing and pain . so much pain . a agonizing eternity , i watched lamy s scowl turn to a horrified shriek . newline newline my wings ! my beautiful wings ! i looked at them enraptured in their dripping beauty , the sharp digits at the end still hardening . my communion was interrupted by my bones suddenly changing from with in . ecstasy mixed with pain , lamy s screams the orchestra to my ascension . newline newline she started to run . she did nt get very far . at least not her arm . shock took over for her as i dipped it into my maw . sweet flowing life force to replace the energy i was losing in my transformation . newline newline she was crawling from me . newline newline saying only one thing .  agar . agar . agar .  newline newline i took the rest of her then . newline newline i sat back down at the controls , blood and ichor surrounding me and felt the pull again . i directed the ship toward the pulse . to my new home . my new life . freedom . i need you to understand something before i kill you.  newline newline yes , ken had thought it over in his head , several times before approaching the girl . it was nt personal , it was for her , not for him . he could see it in her eyes , she did nt care what he had to say . newline newline  you can  t.  she was nt hesitant , she was nt afraid , if he had to pick a word , he would say she was agitated . not quite angry , just like she  d heard this all before . newline newline  i know what you are . i know you  re hard to kill.  he frowned .  i know that if i were to let you go , it would only be more suffering.  newline newline she narrowed her eyes slightly .  what do you know about suffering ?  her voice was filled with disdain . she still did not waver , confident , meeting his gaze , staring down the barrel of his gun . newline newline  i need you to know , i have felt your pain . the pain of centuries alone , and i know how to end it all.  he spoke truly , his existence was filled with pain , with suffering . he was nt a true immortal , no , he was forcibly reborn , recalling each past life . he always ended up the same . newline newline he seemed to have her interest now , her glare softened slightly .  how can you possibly  newline newline a resounding boom filled the hallways of the abandoned building . he had pulled the trigger . she fell to the floor , blood pouring from her head . it  s so fast .  he thought to himself as he pulled her limp body from the ground . it was already starting to regenerate , the wound would be closed in minutes . i don  t know if i have enough time .  he picked up the pace , shuffling down the hallway , out the side door . she had to pick a school to meet in . the investigation is going to really be something when they find all that blood in the morning .  it could nt be helped . newline newline he quickly placed her in the back seat of his vehicle before falling into the front seat , mind racing . i have to kill her . i can  t let her keep living like this .  his mind was racing . he pushed the accelerator to the floor . i don  t think fire will do it . it would be painful if she were to survive it .  he considered putting a knife in her heart , but if someone were to find her and remove it , his efforts would be wasted . he shook his head , glancing in the rearview mirror to see her blinking her eyes open . newline newline  where am i ?  she glances around the vehicle . a look of exhaustion and boredom mixing on her face . newline newline  you were nt supposed to wake up yet.  he glances over his shoulder .  that was supposed to keep you out until we made it ba  a bus slams the backside of his car , interrupting his sentence . as the car rolls , he curses himself for making such a mistake , he is unable to do so for long , as he loses consciousness as they slam into a nearby building . newline newline he groggily opens his eyes , trying to regain a sense of what happened . how long was i out ?  he wonders to himself . he can  t restrain his reaction at the gun barrel inches from his face . on the other end of it , the girl he was trying to kill . he tries to put his hands up , only to realize he  s tied to a chair . newline newline her demeanor had nt changed .  i need you to understand something ,  she said lightly , parroting the phrase .  before i kill you.  newline newline he could nt restrain the smirk that crawled up the side of his face . he tilted his head slightly , and she pressed the barrel against his cheek . newline newline she leaned in close .  you know nothing of my pain . this is my proof.  he watched her finger pull the trigger , the moment before the gun fired seemed to stretch on forever . newline newline edit : a word newlinefrom when you re old enough to speak they tell you  write your words do nt say them . do nt say them unless you truly must or your heart feels like bursting . when i met anna , i knew those words were meant for her . i took her out to my favorite tree in the park . packed a picnic lunch and our favorite books . i took her hand as we sat and smiled . we spent the next few hours laughing and playing , munching on crackers and lying in each others laps as we read . in those moments the world was ours . as the sun set on our perfect day , i took her in my arms and looked into her eyes . i was ready . this was it . no warmer a smile could affirm it for me . i took a deep breath . newline newline  i love you .  newline newline anna s smile faded . she sat up in my lap and thought for a moment . then she looked into my eyes , stroked my face with her fingers and shook her head . no . newline newline the words were gone . wasted . never so far had my heart fallen so fast . i watched her walk away , unable to call after her . there was nothing left to say . she kept her words . i lost mine .i stood there dumbfounded while holding the dollar bill in between my fingers ready to drop it into the bucket bellow . we stared at each other for the longest time before i looked around wondering if there were any hidden cameras . this must be some sort of prank . why santa claus would be sitting on the dirty ground dressed up as a beggar on the jolliest season of the year was beyond my comprehension . noting nothing wrong with our surrounding i gazed back at those bright blue eyes and saw him grin back at me . newline newline  are you or are you not giving me that dollar bill son ?  newline newline i looked at my still hand and quickly pocketed the money back inside my jeans .  why are you here ?  i demanded , a bit frustrated that santa claus was slacking instead of doing his job in making kids all over the world happy . newline newline  what do you mean ?  he asked as he sat up properly from the wall he was leaning against . newline newline  are nt you supposed to be working on toys or something ?  newline newline he laughed that classic hearty laugh only he could make while his belly jiggled .  ho . ho . ho . i am at work denny . this is part of the job .  newline newline denny frowned , not convinced .  sitting in the middle of the street begging for money is part of your job ? did you run out of funds for your toy factory or something ?  newline newline  no denny , i am just here checking on the adults like you .  newline newline  checking the adults huh ? well whatever santa claus , i just hope you are nt late in bringing kids what they want this christmas .  newline newline denny took out from his wallet a 100 dollars bill and deposited it inside the bucket .  here . in case you needed it for something .  newline newline he glanced at santa claus one last time before he turned around and walked away . santa claus grabbed the folded list inside his red jacket and wrote down denny s name on the nice  column . newline newline  i wonder if he will leave me some cookies as well .  he mused with a knowing smile . newlinehonestly i do nt think i m a good writer so i ve been trying to improve myself by writing at least 750 words of something daily . i decided to write for this prompt today . some constructive criticism would be appreciated . newline newline there s one thing most people do nt understand about writing . writing is nt just an art , it s a power that parallels the omnipotence of god . a skilled writer dreams up worlds where there is none , and turns them into a reality at will .  newline newline  i ve got nothing ,  the writer thought as he placed his pen aside and crumpled up his sheet of paper . kicking his chair backwards , he eyed the trashcan across the room that had crumpled papers scattered around it . he gently flung the piece of paper across and with a rustling sound , it fell into the trashcan . he let out a sigh and stretched his arms .  that s seven out of thirteen ,  he whispered to himself . the room was silent and dark , with only a soft light emanating from the lamp on the writer s desk . he closed his eyes and searched for a place to create a world in the darkness of the void . then an idea struck him like lightning . he rushed across the room and grabbed a piece of paper on the floor .  this is nt it ,  he thought , flinging the crumpled paper aside . tossing each wrong piece of paper aside , his eyes gleamed as he finally found the one he was looking for . he read the first sentence out loud .  we were nt god fearing people , but now it s too late to ask for forgiveness .  newline newline he sat back in his chair with his paper and gripped his pen . he started writing ,  we were struck down by the wrath of god and violently thrown out of eden . world peace became world war , happiness became suffering , and haves became needs .  newline newline the world swirled around the writer and suddenly he was standing in the middle of a dirty , desaturated city street . it was silent , except for the sound of machines whirring off in the distance . the homeless littering the street almost looked like ragdolls  it was impossible to tell who was still living and who was nt . a baby s cry startled the writer . he turned around and saw the baby held lightly in the mother s arm . he looked at the mother . the mother was lying against the decaying brick wall , her eyes were open wide with the blacks of her eye missing . the writer stared at the mother for a moment . seeing no movement , he turned and looked down the street . dark brown smog covered most of his vision and he was able to see no more than the burning trashcan several meters away from him . a large truck came into his view . almost all its colors were faded , and rust covered its chassis . as it moved closer to him , he noticed the smell of death . with a clanking sound , a large claw extended from its side and grabbed a man off the sidewalk and tossed him into the back of the truck with a thud . again , the claw grabbed another man . no signs of struggle .  they must be dead ,  he thought . the claw then started moving towards him . frantically , he jumped off to the side . the claw moved past him and grabbed the mother . as the claw retracted , the mothers arm relaxed and dropped the baby on the floor . slowly , the truck drove off , leaving the writer behind with the baby s weak cries . he walked over to the baby , who was wrapped in a dirty , torn brown rag . he took the baby and gently rested him against the wall and walked down the street . newline newline he approached a group of three men huddled together around a man on the floor . one of the men , who was dressed in a black sweater , grabbed the skinny man on the floor and slammed him against the brick wall of a building . the skinny man fell to the floor and the other two men started kicking him . the skinny man curled up into a fetal position and the soft sound of his cry could barely be heard over the sound of his bones breaking . as the three men walked away , the man on the floor was left remaining there , lifeless . the man s eyes were open , his shirt was torn and his body was bruised all over . the blood from mouth and nose mixed with the tears from his eyes . newline newline as he walked down the street , he saw a scrawny woman crawling towards him on all fours . he stood there , staring at her , fascinated . the woman grasped his leg , looking up at him , begging him for forgiveness . he tried to move but the woman strengthened her grip on his leg . he grabbed her by the shoulders and shoved her off and she easily flew off . he walked beside her and looked at her desperate face . with her remaining strength , she kneeled , facing him and clasped her hands . she prayed to god , to him . he looked at her , and said one word .  die .  her face filled with fear as she collapsed on the floor . he stood over her lifeless body .  pathetic ,  he thought to himself . newline newline looking around himself , he smiled , satisfied at his own creation . so ...  newline newline  ... so what ?  newline newline  so , about this   newline newline  eli , please , not yet .  newline newline  got ta discuss it sometime , right ?  newline newline  i ca nt do this right now .  newline newline of course she could nt do this now . that had been her excuse for a while . she was too busy , too tired , or too stubborn . eli ground his teeth and took a deep , cleansing breath . newline newline  you know it s just going to get worse if we do nt   newline newline  eli , i appreciate what you re trying to do , but seriously : not now .  newline newline  would we even have this conversation if i was the one who cheated ?  newline newline sandra gasped and her face went as white as the flour on her hands . newline newline  what do you mean would we have this conversation  if you had been the one ?  newline newline  i mean , if a guy cheats in a relationship , then he s just some skirtchasing pervert .  newline newline  oh , please , guys brag about their romantic conquests all the time , even if it s cheating or not .  newline newline  but ,  he spoke over her ,  if a woman cheats , it s because she s lonely or the guy did nt understand   newline newline as much as she hated it , as much as she did nt want to , she quickly found herself bursting into tears . eli stopped talking and looked away from sandra as she fetched a dish towel and began dabbing at her eyes . he truly wanted to feel sorry for her , he desperately wanted to understand where she was coming from , but he just couldn  t . his mind still reeled at the enormity of the situation and he found it so hard to believe something like this could happen . this couldn  t happen , not to them , not after four years of living together , and all the good and bad things that came with it . his hands fidgeted , itching for some activity , so he turned back to the cutting board while chopping vegetables and struggling to keep his voice calm . newline newline  ii keep going over it in my head again and againi want to understand why it happened , butthen it starts hurting too much and i stop .  newline newline  if that  s what you  re feeling , what do you think i  m   she could feel herself getting angry and she knew that was the wrong path to take . newline newline they looked at each other and mutually understood they were on a precipice , that whatever they said to one another in the next few moments would decide everything . bippity..boppity.boop ! ! !  he roared at the top of his lungs  his arms flailing like a mad man as he gesticulated his fingertips . his eyes lit up  his irises vanished , revealing a bright blue light that emanated out of them  the impact force brimming from his hands nearly knocked off his wide designed , navy blue top hat , which was curved stylishly at the sides . he was an oddly dressed man who wore an impressively long black cape , navy blue pinstriped suit , and a proud monocle upon his left eye . he pursed his thin , mustachioed lips as he delved deeply in concentration  the energy rising through his frame shot out powerfully at kailen  s girlfriend mariah , surrounding her body with purpose . she stared on in fright , as did her boyfriend  the energy engulfing her , wrapping around her body like an old blanket . within an instant the energy expanded , setting off an explosion . kailen did his best to regain his focus from the blinding light  where mariah formally was had now been replaced with a massive pumpkin . newline newline the strange man leered proudly at the sight , and made a strange jazz hand gesture towards kailen ,  magica ! ! ! !  he shouted proudly to kailen  s dumbfounded expression . newline newline  whawhat in the world did you just do ? !  he yelled in confusion , stunned by the sight of the incredibly orange pumpkin that stood in place of the love of his life ,  dude , where the hell is mariah ? ! !  newline newline the man chuckled to himself ,  where is mariahheh , heh , heh  good one sir kailen ! but of course she is right here before you  transformed ! the magical wizard genius  namastrous the great has just shown you the true power of the magic arts ! !  he stated it in a bafflingly bragging tone . newline newline kailen was not amused  his fists tensed and shook . the man had been staying with them for a week  a favor he was doing for his father . how the man knew his dad was its own mystery , but he tried to be a good son , and do as his father asked , but namastrous was hard to bear , and even a week felt like a decade . now he had gone too far  it was the last straw for kailen . they had mocked him and his claims of being magical  a statement that he clung to feverishly since he stepped across their threshold , which only made them tease him harder , eventually causing the couple to make a bet with one another on whether he was a liar or not . their teases and disbelief built up , and had now come to this moment  his girlfriend was a giant vegetable , or fruit  one of those , but definitely not his girlfriend . newline newline  are you out of your mind ? ! ! !  kailen shouted , huffing and puffing in frustration , taking the self acclaimed wizard by surprise . newline newline  i don  t understand ,  he moped ,  you asked me to prove my wizardly prowess , and i  ve done so  quite brilliant i would state.  newline newline  by turning my girlfriend into a pumpkin ? ! ! ! !  he interrogated with a roar . newline newline  well in that way yes  it  s a powerful transformation spell , this is third class wizardry  high level stuff ,  he nodded with a sense of accomplishment . newline newline kailen shook his head baffled ,  you.are an insane person ! ! !  he shouted with a fluster in his tone  namastrous took slight offense  kailen didn  t care ,  change her back now !  newline newline  now ?  newline newline  yes ! ! now ! ! !  newline newline  ..like , now , now ?  newline newline  yes now , now ! ! ! what other now could i possibly mean dude ? !  he sneered ,  change her back !  newline newline  well ,  namastrous twiddled his fingers apprehensively  kailen gazed at him with violence in his mind .the cassinihuygens probe had been orbiting saturn for more than 12 years , circling the gas giant and its spectacular rings countless times . the spacecraft had provided stunning images of the planet and incredible insights into the nature of its moons to the scientists beaming it commands back on earth , yet despite its myriad sensory equipment it was still oblivious to what would undoubtedly be their greatest discovery to date . newline newline the sleek , black spaceship hunkered down to the pitted surface of one of the larger icy rocks drifting through the immense rings of the giant planet . a series of plates extended around it , like a metal skirt , hiding the faint glow of a low intensity laser as it bored into the rock s surface . the perfect blackness of the craft s surface glistened as minute atoms of atmosphere condensed to it as it matched the sub zero temperatures of its surroundings . newline newline inside , kigann watched the bright golden space probe drift overhead through the tinted windows of his ship with an almost pitying look . the thing was so damn obvious . he watched it for a little longer , before returning his attention to the rings themselves  it would nt do to become so distracted that he failed to see an impending collision , or something worse . behind him , his two crewmates continued to make themselves busy with work . or rather , one of them was , he corrected himself as another chuckle sounded from ziivan . newline newline could you keep it down ?  snapped shaelin , looking up from the drill controls to glare at ziivan . some of us are trying to work !  newline newline sorry ,  giggled ziivan , wiping away tears of mirth , but these humans are just so damned funny !  he indicated the screen , on humans seemed to be attempting to complete an impossible obstacle course . newline newline they re plain foolish if you ask me .  said kigaan , still scanning the view outside the ship s window . beaming out signals and probes nonstop like that , mark my words  one of these days they re gon na ...  he stopped dead , his eyes fixed on a point far off in the distance . he held his breath , not daring to make a sound as he studied the far edge of the rings intensely . newline newline kigaan ?  asked shaelin anxiously . newline newline kill the power .  he barked , turning and rapidly shutting down every console in the ship . now !  the others complied , the urgency in his voice silencing any questions they may have had . within seconds , the entire ship was plunged into darkness and silence , the only light now coming through the window from the reflective surface of the gas giant . for a few minutes they sat in silence , not daring to make any noise . then , just as ziivan was getting ready to speak again , something dark darted past outside . shaelin s hands flew to her mouth to suppress a scream . she knew what was coming . they all did . newline newline more and more small , dark shapes flew past . then came the larger ones . then the really big ones . an immense swarm of pitch black nightmares  their shapes hard to make out with their dark colours perfectly hiding them in the void , visible only when they passed in front of the planet . a pair of the smaller ones tumbled past , long , sickening appendages tangled around the form of the human s space probe . light blue spots on their bodies lit up as wide , voidlike mouths sucked at the machine . kigaan could faintly see a faint stream of energy being sucked from it until one of the larger , ship sized creatures drifted over and engulfed the entire thing , the smaller ones scattering just in time . the crew felt as though ice was flowing through their veins as the creature seemed to turn straight towards them , blue lights flickering along its form as it chewed on the probe . after a few terrifying moments , it turned and rejoined the swarm , disappearing into the shadow of one of the immense leviathans at the heart of the swarm . newline newline it was about half an hour before the last of the swarm had drifted past , and another ten before any of them felt they could speak again . newline newline they ... they re heading ffor the human s world !  shaelin said in a hoarse whisper , we have to warn them ! there must be something we can do ?  newline newline there s nothing me can do .  kigaan snapped back in a whisper of his own . he quickly powered up the ship and began to take off . i told you  i knew this would happen sooner or later if they did nt keep quiet . i found this very interesting as i had a very strange encounter with the lottery .  thenre , i am assuming you are talking about powerball ? when you posted those numbers , you never had a powerball number . so i checked the powerball history combining those 6 numbers the 4 different ways , and they never did all come up . however , using 5 as the powerball 4 numbers did come up about a month ago . also , interestingly , at least 3 of these numbers come up with some frequency . newline newline about 9 years ago i was onto the lottery numbers , but i did not have them quite right . then about a month later all the lottery numbers that had hit on may 26 , 2005 came up on the back of my ticket numbers . none of the tickets were worth anything , and sadly one of them with the winning 33 at the end of the ticket number , which had been the winning number on may 26 , 2005 was kept by the retailer . then the lottery machine reset the ticket numbers and by coincidence i ended up with another lottery ticket with the same exact ticket number with the 33 at the end that i had lost ! i have a photo copy of this . newline newline after that , things got strange with the lottery . numbers were posted at the store for the next week , yet they had not been drawn yet . i asked about this , but the lady working at the store said it must be some kind of mistake . so i got the bright idea to play these numbers , but it was a bad idea . i filled out the ticket , and on the way to the store a truck exactly like mine swerved into my lane and almost hit me head on . i almost turned around , but i thought they are only numbers . newline newline when i submitted my card , the lady at the store asked me if i was sure i wanted to play those numbers . strange , that had never been asked before . the machine took a real long time to print out the numbers . as i was handed the ticket i looked behind me . the girl behind me was wearing a shirt with a broken heart on it . it said  you broke it , now you have to fix it  . i thought it must be some weird coincidence . btw , those numbers did not come up . newline newline that night i watched constantine at my ex wifes house , they just happened to be watching it . it was like hell was coming out of the tv . i am normally a normal guy , but my ex and her friends could tell i was losing it . i went home , and noticed the state flag at the firehouse was inverted . instead of a blue background and yellow seal , it had a yellow background , and blue seal . it was like i was in an alternate universe . newline newline as it got light i took my truck and went into the mountains to get away from it all . i walked up an old logging road . there were flowers that were beautiful when i walked by , but when i would turn around there would be silk worms all over them , weird , they were not there when i walked by . it was august , and very hot . i met a couple walking down the road . strange , no one usually hiked this road . strangely , when they talked to me they seemed confused , and did not know what day it was . newline newline i could not find the trail to the creek , so i finally got so thirsty , and was not thinking right . i left my pants and coat at a specific forest service marking because i was so hot , walked down to the creek down a very steep bank in my shorts and t shirt , drank a bunch of water , and hiked down a very treacherous creek . i finally found the trail and hiked out to my truck and drove home . newline newline i had my wallet in my pants . things were still askew in my mind when i hiked back up to get my pants and wallet two days later . very strangely , my pants were not at the forest sevice marked coordinate where i put them , but on the next coordinate up ! it was like reality had changed slightly from the way it had been . not only that , they were tearing that road up for no apparent reason . i had to go around a guy on the ungated road digging part of the road out with a backhoe . i had never seen him before , even though this was a very small town . he had his shirt off and had strange tattoos running down his back . he also had very odd pale blue eyes that were very blue . i could nt help but ask , and he said they were contacts he wore for the chicks . it was sunny out , and i never saw contacts . this was not the type of guy that looked like he would be operating a backhoe for the forest service . they tore the whole gated logging road and the road i drove up over the next few days , and replaced all culverts , even though it did not need to be done , almost like they were fixing whatever glitch i had caused . i told some friends what had happened and drove them up that road . they did not know what to think , but did not discount m story . i was well liked and respected around there . newline newline there were some other things that happened , but i will not get into it all . like right when this was happening i tried to call my mother , but there were no outgoing calls from my town long distance . eventually , every thing returned to normal . i am not giving out my real name or where this took place . what do you all think ? newlinethunk . thunk . thunk .  as the cool night breeze blows gently against my skin , i slowly become aware of my surroundings . overhead there is a a full red moon peaking out above the tops of the trees . what a beautiful sight . on instinct , i resume my task of digging . i can not recall why i m digging , i just know i need to finish what i started . my mind starts to blank as the shovel hits the dirt again and again . the monotony is calming , and it starts to resonate within me . it has been a long while since i ve felt so at ease . as i inhale deeply , i notice the air smells of pine , dirt , sweat , and the iron tang of blood . such a nice scent . a few more minutes pass until i know i m done digging . now to put my prize to rest . newline newline i stretch to relieve the ache in my muscles before turning around to retrieve the body . ah yes , body . that certainly is a prize . i look closely at the form on the ground . the woman looks very familiar to me , though it s difficult to tell who it is since her face is splattered in blood and dirt , twigs and pine needles caught in gorgeous red hair , body dressed in a form fitting oncewhite gown . but no , this wo nt do . i must see her face again before laying her to rest . kneeling down , i do my best to remove the caked dirt and blood . her face comes into view , and suddenly the familiarity makes sense . newline newline it s me . this should be alarming , but the relaxation that has settled in my bones counters any feelings of panic . i lift the body up with a strength i ve never possessed before , and lower it into the grave . i glance down at my work in wonder . the body i m in now feels so calm , and the face below looks so serene . finally , i am at peace . as i grasp the shovel and begin to pour dirt back into the grave , avoiding covering the face as long as possible , i realize this is a gift . this is a gift that i would be honored to share with others . smiling , i take my shovel and go looking for the next person in need of some cheer . i m sorry mr. abraham , but we must  foreclose on your house  clark struggles with a check and pen , out of his pocket  here , here please i ll make out my first mortgage , just cash it in two week s  the teller gets up and walks away , clark sits in the leather couch , staring at the mahogany desk  for several minutes , until a guard stomps over and asks clark to leave . newline next day clark wakes up to find , a couple of men breaking into his car . he flies down the stairs , and bursts out the door yelling  hey ! get the f   away from my car  one of the car thefts holds up a clipboard with a paper stating , clark abraham s toyota camry is to be repossessed on june 3rd , 2015 . clark grabs his head in utter agony , he feels like he s falling into an endless pit . newline clark sits in the bank owned house , he once called home  on the verge of tears . when an idea pops into his head , rob the bank that robbed me , he thinks to him self , clark grabs his .44 revolver that his father left him , throws on a hoody  and an old halloween mask of freddy . clark calls his best friend olli , who s been hurting for money a long time ,  hey , hey olli , you want to make a shit load of money ?  a sickly voice answers back  hell yes clark , i ll come pick you up right now  ten minutes pass and olli drives up in an beat up pontiac four door sunbird , clark get s in , olli sits there gaped tooth , balding , with a wife beater and jeans . newline  okay , ollie head to the bank and just sit in the car okay  , ollie stares blankly at clark  your going to rob the bank , are nt yeah ?  clark nods , ollie shrugs , the plan is set . clark dawns the mask and hood , jumps through the bank doors screaming at the top of his lungs  everyone on the ground , this is a robbery !  he wildly points the gun from guard to guard , person to teller . newline  drop your guns !  clark commands the guards ,  hey asshole !  a voice yells from behind , clark turns around to see bank patron standing with a gun pointing at him . clark feel s the slug slamming into his chest at 1,700mph , then the sound of the gun reaches clarks ears . no pain , first thing clark thought , no pain , he looks down at his expected bloodied hoodie  but no blood , just a hole . as he lifts his hoodie the mushroom shaped bullet falls to the ground , everyone stares in amazement , the vigilante raises the gun a bit and fires again . hitting clarks eye , again no pain . the second round lying on the ground next the first , clark walks up the shooter and pistol whips him to the ground . clark turns back to the tellers ,  money ! now !  , he screams . tellers hustle to throw all the money into garbage bags  once done they hand the bags to clark . he walks out to a group of cops pointing their guns at clark , olli had taken off when the first shot was fired .  put the gun down  commanded the cop , clark smiles and raises his gun .

and the researcher saw . she saw what had happened to her friend , and became more terrified than she had ever been in her life . her friend s eyes were wide , devoid of any thought or sentience . they were broken eyes . something was wrapped around her face , and a horrific creature was perched upon her back , five jointed tentacles wrapped around what was on her friend s face . newline newline the researcher could not process what she saw , it was too much . she lost control of her bladder , urinating uncontrollably , as her sanity began to slip . another one of the creatures approached her , another one of those things in it s hands . she was robbed of her will , she could offer up no resistance as it slipped a bit into her mouth , and pulled the bridle over her head .

, laden with all kinds of pipes and cables , black steel . he was definitely still there . newline newline slowly , his whole body aching , craving water , food and oxygen , he slid from the thin mattress of folded clothing . technically , eric was lucky compared to most of the crew down the hallway , somehow sleeping on the bare pipes in the boiler room . he chuckled at the thought of the mere existence of luck , down here , in the cold hell called ocean . then again , when he realized that he just had made some kind of joke . newline newline the floor creaked as he moved his boots across it , tiredly shuffling towards the hatch leading to the communications room . it was only a dozen meters away , but every step was an ordeal . when eric finally stepped through the metal ring , he already was out of breath , cold sweat soaking his tanktop . another three steps and he had reached the radio operator , a young man , pale as death beneath his tanned skin , rhythmically hammering onto a small device beneath his right hand . newline newline eric laid his hand on the operator s shoulder and squeezed it softly . the man turned his head , his lifeless eyes failed to focus . a small nod , then the same as response . no one wanted to waste their breath with talking , wanted to go through the act of ripping their dried up vocal cords open . within a moment , the two had swapped positions and eric slipped the sweaty leather headphones on , laid his own hand on the small device . a handwritten , yellow note in front of him displayed the message he would have to send

, producing its own breathable air and freshwater , limited only by the food rations the crew was able to pack . that was , unfortunately , no longer true , as a depth charge had hit them , crippling

calm his racing pulse , breathing deep and slowly . there had been a voice . a message . soft as a pillow and light as an angel . he was sure of it . newline newline but he only heard the ocean s steady hum and the deep grumbling of distant battles . a single , sad whining chime came from somewhere portside , a lone whale mourning the destruction , the death that the warring humans had brought so deep into the once calm waters . newline newline eric nodded in agreement with the whale s cries and moved back to the morse taper , back to reciting his very own desperate cry directed at those who floated above and went back out of his head , this wreck , this sea . newline newline sailor ... wo nt you talk to me , sailor ?  newline newline there it was again . a voice . a nice one , too .

blowing away eric s sorrow , his pain , his tiredness . without even realizing it , he stood up , unplugging the microphone still gripped in his hand with the motion . he whispered , as softly as his hoarse throat would allow him , blankly staring at his console . newline newline  this is the u.. who , who are you ?  newline newline a giggle ran over the submarine s hull , rippling across the

confused look on the seaman , who had been attracted by the first sound of a human voice in over a day , stumbling into the cabin , eric followed the singsang , his hands running over the back side

into anger . cracking screams missed eric s ears as he , his mind , his heart , his soul belonged to the womanly face shining through the fist thick metal at his front , to the sugary lips whispering the essence of dreams into his ears until he could feel the warmth of the sun in shallow waters , taste the refreshing aroma of the rivers touching the ocean , smell the electrifying scent of a storm

when jezzy opened the hellmouth . newline newline  i m glad that got wrapped up . i m too old for this crap . they treated me like an animal . i would be locked in a cage every time my captors left . no food or water or time to go to the bathroom during the entire time they were gone . newline newline to be honest , i didn  t know any better . memories flitted at the edge of my mind of brothers

repeat . this was my life . newline newline i tried to gain the trust of my captors . sometimes i understood them sometimes i didn  t . their language sounded so foreign . i tried to communicate with them , but they never understood . newline newline i  d stand at the window when i was free from my cage . if i alerted them to threats maybe they wouldn  t see me as one . this only made them mad , and they would yell . i stopped doing it . newline newline i picked up some words , but it was only for things that would humiliate me . sit . stay . roll over . fetch . newline newline over time my

each channel for a split second , not actually watching what was on but rather just doing it because it was a habit . i stopped on the news as something caught my eye . a picture of a beautiful pale skinned brunette was displayed on the right side of the screen , on the left was her name ,  josephine flynn  she was murdered last night , stabbed to death in a hospital . i heard a scratching noise behind me , i launched up , throwing the cereal bowl across the room . behind me was a pitch black cat with bright yellow almost amber eyes . it stared me dead in the eyes and meowed . nothing happened . i was expecting a shockwave , maybe mr . grim  the reaper  to show up with his scythe and boney hands , but nothing happened . i turned around and that s when i saw it . my cereal bowl was frozen midair , i could make out individual particles of milk . i sighed and turned around to stare directly at the cat  . newline newline  so , you re death ? are nt you meant to be somewhat humanoid , with a scythe , flowing robes , boney hands ? you know . all that stereotypical shit ?  the cats tilted its head at me and simply meowed . again nothing happened . though it felt like something should be . newline newline  that s how it s gon na be is it , gon na play innocent ? fine .  i bent down and picked the cat up by the scruff . i carried him to my door , opened it and threw him into the hallway .  stay out !  i went back to my lounge room and began to ,  i do nt know ... it s not technically picking it up if it s floating  i cleaned up the spilt bowl of cereal . as i dumped the bowl and its contents in the sink i heard a meow from behind me . spinning around i saw the same cat i d just thrown into the hall , sitting patiently behind me . its yellow eyes appeared more like pieces of amber than before .  did nt i throw you out of my place ?  i poked the cat in the forehead , it shook its head at me and calmly licked its paw . i hate cats . arrogant bastards . the cat opened its mouth to meow . newline newline  i am not arrogant .  a deep booming voice echoed forth from the cat s mouth . newline newline  ah hah !  i exclaimed loudly .  i fucking knew you were death !  the cat looked at me with a bored expression . newline newline  i m not death , fool . i m death s cat . i handle anything that does nt require reaping .  he said this as if it was completely normal . newline newline  so . what do you want with me ? mr deaths cat .  his eyes fixed on mine . newline newline  did you pay attention to the news ? the dead girl . josephine flynn .  it felt like he was talking down to me . like i was a toddler . newline newline  you are a toddler to me , mortal . i am far , far older than you shall ever be . now , i need you to fix the situation with josephine flynn . she s not meant to be dead and i do nt have the time to fix it . so you ll do it for me .  he turned and sauntered away from me . i followed closely behind . newline newline  you can read my mind ? why ca nt you fix it yourself ? what s it got to do with me ? why did nt you say so in the first place ? how do i fix it ? what do i get if i fix it ?  the questions spewed out of my mouth so fast i m surprised i did nt bite my tongue off . newline newline  yes , i can . because i m busy . everything . you did nt ask . easily , i m going to send you back in time and you merely speak to her . that ll fix it . you get your soul mate .  he answered all of my questions without missing a beat . never once did he falter while walking . we reached the only window in my apartment . he jumped up onto the ledge and looked back at me . newline newline  now , it s time for you to go .  newline newline how do i.. before i could even finish thinking the thought he answered .  you jump . once you hit the ground , it ll be tomorrow morning . do nt bother going to work , just quit . go to the hospital at exactly 5:32pm and speak with her . she ll be on the 4thfloor visiting her friend . good luck .  newline newline before i knew it , he d managed to push me out the window . how a cat managed this , i do nt know . i guess it s better not to question it . it is deaths cat after all . i had enough time to look down , see the pavement and scream . i jerked awake on the couch , the bowl of cereal previously resting on my chest flying off and smashing into my tv . my alarm clock read  10:10am  i still had time to have a shower , get dressed and get down to the hospital . i quickly showered , dressed in jeans , a plain black tee , tugged on my work boots and rocketed out the door . i know i still had ages , but it would take an hour minimum to get there by public transport and i wanted to be real early just in case . newline newline i reached the hospital at 12:27pm and sat down the lobby . i put my earbuds in and zoned out . at 2pm a nurse poked me awake to ask me if i was okay .  yeah , i m fine . just waiting for someone . thanks .  putting my earbuds back in i zoned out once again until my alarm went off at 5pm . standing up i stretched and made my way to the 4th floor . deaths cat never told me where on the floor she was , just that she was here somewhere . so i went searching . at 5:30pm i saw her at the far end of the hall . i do nt know why , but i started to run towards her . i was about 4metres from her when i tripped over my shoelaces , i d forgotten to tie them before leaving home . i d just face planted directly in front of her . newline newline  holy shit ! are you okay , sir ?  she knelt next to me and poked me in the side of the head . i laughed so hard i thought i d cough up a lung .  who pokes someone in the head after they ve just face planted ?  i managed to gasp out between laughs .  i do .  i could hear the smile in her voice . newline newline she helped me to my feet and brushed me off .  my names josephine , my friends call me jo .  newline newline i smiled at her .  nice to meet you , jo . i m harley .  so this is it , eh ?  i said to the man bound by ropes on the floor . no answer . i washed my hands again . i ve always thought a man should be measured by two things : the love from his closest who keep him company , and his own personal hygiene . at least i have one of those going for me . newline newline i spoke again , this time almost cheerfully .  happy new year , pal .  thinking back , it seems everything that could go wrong had so this year . alan , who had been my best friend for years , always greeting me with a smile , had died this september . olivia , the beautiful woman i ve had the privilege of sharing my life with for almost four years started packing her bags just the other day . on top of all that , i ve had two break ins . two ! newline newline alan always used to joke and say that i was  favored by the heavens  . for as long as i can remember i ve always had good luck . growing up in the slums , alan and i dreamed of living in a great house , every room filled with those we cared about . of course , only i fulfilled that dream . my luck was plenty to carry me to the top , but alan s cheerfulness had no such effect . newline newline having forgot about the burglar for a moment , i turned my attention to him again .  at least i have you .  newline newline wait , that s not true . i carried the burglar on the wagon to the next room where olivia sat silently in front of the fire .  you re staying with me after all  , i said softly with a smile . i kept pushing the wagon with the burglar , passing the sofa where mittens was laying in his favorite spot . i gave him an appreciative smile . he appeared to be sleeping .  lazy cat  i laughed to myself . newline newline i arrived at the basement door and opened it , revealing the two people inside .  this is alan  i said .  the other man is the robber who came in here three days ago , maybe you know each other .  we went down the stairs .  no  , i said to myself .  i m not alone  . a foul stench reached my nose .  it s time for your shower soon , alan !  alan had smiled at me since i came in there , not his usual smile , but a stiff , nasty smile which made me feel uneasy .  stop it alan .  i said quietly .  stop it !   stop it ! ! !  i screamed , banging his head against the wall until my hands were bloody . newline newline having cleaned up the mess and given alan a bath i suddenly had a horrifying thought .  i truly feel alone . it was all so sudden . there was nothing he could have done . those two phrases kept repeating in his head , over and over again . they were no solace , as he cradled his head in his hands , those same hands which had held the president as she had laid dying . newline newline it was all over he knew . even before her blood from the wounds had dried , the news had come in , the deaths of each leader hitting the world like a ton of bricks . the prime minister of great britain , the president of france , the chairman of china all died to an assassin s bullet  even putin , not in his palace has had been expected , was unable to escape a bomb teleported into his car . newline newline none of it felt real , all names and figures , famous to be sure , but miles away , far from personal . but the president , the warmth of her body , the warmth of her blood , as he cradled her , willing her to live ... the peoples  president , but his lover . newline newline there was no stopping their advance . there was no point . there was no chance of victory , no chance of vindication , no chance of justice . newline newline he remembered , what seemed like an eternity ago , the campaign , the triumph , the crowds , cheering her , banners waving , of her visage and her slogan ,  follow my lead .  so he did just that . he followed her .it started with the 403 projects . 403 paintings by bob ross . someone on youtube started gaining traction when he figured out bob was painting actual places . he was one of those guys who always had money because of

friend was walking through the episode when he spotted a tree with a paint brush carved into it with the initial br . the video showed a decayed hand before it shut out . newline newline episode 20 and again in episode 32 . the same carving , the same initials , and the same decayed corpse . from then on , it was as if in each episode the youtube star was searching for it . well he found it . newline newline episode 34 , 35 , 37 , and 38 . we found it there . the authorities started to revisit old episodes . they found a new body underneath a carving of a paint brush and initials . newline newline i remember seeing an interview with steve ross , his son . poor guy , he was teary eyed and apologized for the sins of his father . they checked his paintings too . he was clean . newline newline the 403 project adopted a new , more exciting definition . 322 bodies found out of 403 . people across the world are now rewatching his videos with a renewed fascination , formulating theories about his character . newline newline in the end , they found 380 of 403 bodies . unable to find the remaining . newline authorities have theorized that bob had strangled his victims to death before stabbing them multiple times , in a way very similar to his dabbing of paint brushes on canvas . leaving multiple tiny little wounds across the victims body . newline newline across the board by coincidence or not , all victims have had especially long silky hair . newline newline newline newline newlinewind calmly blew through the trees and brush that surrounded the forest . the grass was wet , trees damp , due to the clouds sprinkling overhead . ahead of me stood a building that looked like it had been there for quite some time , withering through nature . the building had been roundshaped with tattered cobblestone steps that led to a set of giant oak doors . i slowly walked up the steps anxiously awaiting what lies ahead ... newline newline  what could be inside ?  i thought as i continued up , step by step , eyes fixed on the oak gateway . the building had a lot of open spaces that i assumed were windows , and as i got closer it felt as if the building kept growing taller and taller . i stepped up onto the stone platform that continued at the top of the stairs . torches lit the two doors , and the light that flooded in through the open windows had slowly started to disappear as the clouds had grown thick . i had now been standing just outside the big oak passageway ... staring at the entrance . newline newline  should i do this ?  i contemplated to myself thinking of all the worse case scenarios , visualizing what may lay ahead . i swallowed my fear , looked forward , and slowly pushed open the two doors . the hinges let out an incredible screech that seemed to have startled the whole forest . the doors slid open on their own until they became locked into the farthest position . i took 1 step forward into the new dark room , smelling the stale air . i was inside the building but it was too dark to see anything . the oak doors started to close behind me and i panicked slightly contemplating to run back but it was too late . newline newline  fuck ! i ca nt see shit !  i yelled out . newline instantly the lights faded on , almost as if someone had turned on the day . i slowly turned around and looked up . clouds ... slightly sprinkling overhead , the wind calmly blowing . i looked down to see that i had been standing on a tattered cobblestone step . i looked up to see a round building with open spaces that looked to be windows , the building had looked withered from nature , and right in the middle ... stood two big oak doors . i now stood at the bottom of the tattered cobblestone steps ... newline newlinesatan needed some cheering up . since his little joke with santa had backfired and that chunky chuckling dogooder had made him look like a fool he  d felt as though he was in a slump . and even worse , after spoiling all his plans santa had taken pity on him and handed over a real christmas present . newline newline pity ! he was the tyrant of the tormented , he didn  t need pity from a man who spent three hundred and sixtyfour days of the year unemployed . santa  s parting comment of  maybe i  ll see you next year  had been the last straw . there was no way he was going to be seen as good enough to warrant another visit from that stocking stuffer ever again . newline newline so it was time to have some fun . newline newline he chosen a small town . with closeknit neighbors and closer families . the kind of place where teenage sweethearts would get married , but with wagging tongues on how tight the brides dress was in the front . where children could play out in the street , because everyone was looking out of the window . where what was right for everyone was decided by the few who wouldn  t admit to ever being wrong . the sort of place where everyone knew everything about everybody . even if it wasn  t any of their business . and just far enough away from anywhere else to keep it a little  stuffy . newline newline perfect . newline newline he planned out the details carefully . he was going to open a shop . but not just any shop , one selling very special items . the kind that would cause trouble here . the premises he had taken over was near a school . in fact you could see the school gates from the doorway . newline newline somewhat ironically the children were quite safe with him . everyone always assumed he was out to ensnare the young and innocent but he wasn  t . he couldn  t . children were immune from damnation and temptation . the young couldn  t be held accountable for their actions as they had no concept of true good and evil . newline newline but the parents were a different matter . newline newline he knew there would be at least one uptight parent who  d make a fuss about the business and with him selling  trash  to  people like that  near their kids . the kind of person who  d start up some sort of group who  s sole aim was to shut him down any way they could and get him out of town . they would meet with the other self proclaimed moralistic citizens to campaign against him . sending out petitions and knocking on doors . phoning up government offices to complain and writing letters to newspapers . newline newline weaving their web of virtuous activism they would ensnare the unwary , the unconcerned and the uninformed with peer pressure , guilt and an overinflated sense of parental and civiv obligation . bringing friends and strangers together into fighting a common enemy . newline newline hopefully they  d give their new group a catchy name , some sort of acronym maybe , and come up with slogans to chant as they passed by his door . he always liked an angry mob to have a good catchphrase . newline newline and then the fun would begin . newline newline he  d spread the seeds of mistrust and uncertainty and watch them grow . somehow a rumor would spread that a certain neighbor had been seen going into the shop . a spouse would find a receipt that seemed to have fallen from their loved ones pocket . a friends car would be found parked outside the business when they  d told you they were busy . newline and that town , now so stuck up and pious would start to eye each other with suspicion . wondering who else was a hypocrite , a lier , a pervert . and with each little crumb of gossip and shifty sideways look the doubt and distrust would fester and grow . and then one day , unable to contain it anymore , they  d turn on each other . striking out with anger and fear they would spread hate and panic , inducing shame and humiliation to those unable to fight back with their own rage and bitterness . newline newline decades of love , friendship and trust wiped out within an entire town . that should make santa stuff himself back up the chimney . newline newline with a puff of sulphuric smoke and a flash of dark aura satan appeared in the middle of the shop floor . this was the first time he  d get to see the interior decked out as a real shop and he was swept away with the excitement . he  d been summoned to one of death  s mandatory group meetings , this one about the new reincarnation paperwork , and had to leave the final steps of his plan to some minor imps . newline all they had to do was write the words of summoning on the floor and then add a few lines of mental fabrication . human imagination would become the template and the whole place would instantly change into how mortals thought it should look . not only was it a quick and easy spell to summon the shop into existence but as it looked  just right  in the mind of the observer they  d not question the fact that the business hadn  t been there just a few hours before . newline newline the nighttime gloom cast deep shadows and the vague shapes he could see around him held so much promise as he prepared to turn on the lights . a throaty laugh escaped him and with a click of his fingers the lights came on . newline newline his wicked grin forming into a confused tightlipped smile as he tried to work out what he was seeing . turning around slowly his eyes tried to make sense of his surroundings . it took him almost five minutes to work it out .tommy started playing with the blocks , he liked blocks they helped him deal wi the voices . then another boy came and he snatched the green block tommy was using for his pyramid . at that moment tommy felt a rush of rage unlike anything he experienced before , he didnt just want to hit the kid , he wanted to make him hurt . badly . tommy grabbed the boy s free hand and started squeezing until he heard a crack . then he twisted it until he felt a hand on his shoulder . he looked down at the bloody mess he made and started crying . the green block was stained red , and tommy liked green . he looked the teacher and with blurry eyes he grabbed her hand , she screamed louder than the rest but tommy did nt care , he just wanted his green block . newline newline newline langley , virginia newline newline newline

slowly , within that time , the silence , the absolute lack of any signs of life , has moved closer and closer to the central kingdoms . as the eclipses have come and gone , as the great engine of creation has begun to slow and stutter , as the mists themselves have begun to thicken , the silence has moved eastwards . newline newline the first scouts sent to the silence never returned . the second wave of scouts vanished in the eclipse . i , trevor finnson , am of the third wave of scouts . we set off from shepherd s rest 13 months ago , a party of 200 riding in buggies and towing caravans of supplies . with each town and city we pass , word it sent to the central kingdoms on our progress . with each bastion of life we pass , the telegraphed messages take to reach the center grows longer . newline newline three months ago , we entered the planes of infinity . the flat expanse of sand , unbroken by dunes or scrub , allowed us the first glimpse of the curvature of the mists , which now sweep around and form a ring of vision that measures 14 miles in diameter . each eclipse , the mists seem to encroach ever so slightly , obscuring our view of the infinite ever so slightly . the sunbelt is dim here , unnaturally so . the few scientists we ve brought along seem to believe that it s something to do with the mists , that they re beginning to reach up to the heavens this far from civilization . newline newline two days ago , we should have reached the far enlightenment temple . our course was true , the navigators are baffled by it s apparent lack of existence . our survival hinged on reaching the temple , as our supplies are running low . newline newline some of the men have begun to whisper that the planes of infinity swallowed the temple , or that the mists swallowed them , or that we ve passed into the silence . yesterday , before the eclipse of night , a scientist decided to stay out and observe the night mists . this morning , as the moonbelt moved out of the path of the sun and the eclipse ended , the scientist was found pacing the camp , raving about the silence and the nothing that followed . newline newline he sounded like a preacher of doom , screaming and crying about something in the sky , about another engine . he claims that the other engine is one of unmaking , that it rests on the opposite side of the world , that we have passed into death and beyond the great engine s protection . newline newline this night , i plan to wait for the eclipse and to see if he is right . i pray to the engine that he is not , that some lurking insanity in his brain finally broke forth and engulfed his mind . but , if he is right , then we are all doomed .  read this for context first   http :

my 18th birthday , it is a very special occasion as we have reached maturity in the eye s of galfena and we are to receive a gift from her that will help tell the world our personality , and decide our status in the village . newline newline it s regarded as a big event in a persons life because it helps decide who we are . some might get dogs , cats , or mice as their gift . some have gotten more exotic animals such as a lions , bears , wolves , and once a platypus was given to ruppert . the unlucky bastard , he got mocked for weeks because of it , but he s settled himself in with his role as the village fisherman so he s doing quite right . newline newline me ? i m not entirely sure what i m looking at right now ... the ritual was performed and done correctly . i practiced the

newline newline okay , this is ... this is weird ... i ll just talk with the village elder about this ... surely he will know something ... or not ... newline newline it seems like this is a first for the elder as well , no one before me has ever received such a gift from galfena before . there is no record of such a beast . newline newline it s rather strange though , most beasts with scales are cold to the such , but this one ... this one feels warm as if i was cradling a child in my arms ... newline newline it may as well be , it s a rather small beast but there have been some deceptive creatures in the past that grew much larger than they were summoned as , so i may want to keep an eye on it . the one thing we do know is it eats meat , it attempted to kill a few chickens we have in pens with it s whip like tail and then snapping at them with it s small mouth . newline newline it was kinda funny if i must admit , but yeah the elder says he does not know what job would be suited for me so he iis giving me a choice of job for the village . i was thinking of maybe being a solider , going out and fighting in heroic battles , kill enemies and live a fantasy life style . newline newline but , i m thinking i might become a trader and travel to other villages to sell goods , and gain a bit of gold to invest into other things that might be able to bring in some profit for our village . newline newline not sure yet , still not sure what this thing is either . but it s interesting to say the least . i think i ll name it ulla .i do nt really keep up with current events  i find that the less i know about people , the better . i suppose one has to be a bit misanthropic to go into my line of work . after all , you ca nt exactly be a people person if you kill people for a living . newline newline the contracts i had up until this point had been pretty small : a cheating husband here , a bitch of a boss there , etc . this particular contract , however , was a big one :  1,000,000 for a single man . that would be enough money for me to finally get out of the game , enough for me to take amanda to one of those fancy swiss clinics . this could be the one that solves all our problems . newline newline so as i got set up on the roof , i was nt thinking about who i was killing  i was thinking about what i was getting . it was a frame of mind that i had cultivated over the years , as a sort of way of coping with the guilt . newline newline i peered through the scope to find my target : a tall , strapping man wearing a wellcut suit . he was sitting just behind the podium , awaiting his turn to address the crowd . beside him sat a slim , shapely woman with dark skin and curly dark hair  on her lap was a little girl , a miniature version of the woman , in a pretty green dress . newline newline as the man got up from his seat , my crosshairs moved with him to the podium . i let him start his little speech before taking a deep breath and newline newline click newline newline the bullet had hit him through the side of his head , causing his body to go spinning like a dance macabre . i could nt help but chuckle as i watched everyone scurry away , panicking like ants under a magnifying lens . however , the smile ran away from my face as i watched the new widow clutch her husband s body , sobbing on his chest . i was just about to pull my eye away from the scope when i saw that little girl , now standing up , staring directly at me . not panicking like the audience . not weeping like her mother . just staring at me with an expressionless gaze , almost like she saw where i was . newline newline i quickly stood up and took apart my gun , packing it in a faux guitar case . i could nt get the little girl out of my head , giving me that unnerving stare . as i rushed my way to the elevator , i tried forgetting about the little girl , about what i just did to her , and about how she knew i was the one who did it . that s stupid ,  i told myself . no one knows it was you ! why would she know it was you ?  newline newline as i stepped outside the back exit , i could hear the police cars approaching the building . deciding to cut my losses , i threw my guitar case into the nearby river and began walking briskly into the building next door . throwing away my gloves into a trash can by the door , i proceeded to the front entrance of the building , where a crowd of people had gathered to watch the police raid the building i had just come out of . i suppressed a smile as i watched them file in , one by one , not knowing that i was just next door . newline newline as i walked away from the scene of the crime , i passed a department store window with several tvs on display . another group was watching attentively , like little old ladies in church . knowing what they were watching , i nevertheless decided to see it for myself . newline newline  ... and we are now getting reports that the police have just entered the ziggurat hotel , the suspected vantage point of the assassin . the ziggurat has been closed for 3 weeks now for renovations . the owners of the ziggurat have yet to be contacted .  newline newline  for those of you just tuning in , we are reporting that dr. abel galn , president of cervantes labs , has been assassinated . dr. galn was a pioneer in cancer treatment , developing several lowcost alternatives to chemotherapy . he leaves behind his wife , dr. mia galnbaxter , and his daughter irene .  newline newline i felt myself go numb as i saw that little girl s face on the screen . she seemed so happy in the picture they showed , not at all like the hollow husk that stared back at me through my scope . slowly , i peeled my eyes from my the screen as i walked away from the crowd . newline newline   newline newline i kept my eyes straight ahead as i walked through the hospital corridor , clutching the roses i bought tightly . i could feel their eyes on me : doctors , nurses , patients , even the janitors . it was impossible for them to know , but i could nt help but feel like they resented me . like they knew what i had done just two days ago , what i had taken away from them . newline newline as i came to room 2103 , i took a deep breath . do nt let her see what you ve done ,  i tell myself . do nt let her see what you ve taken from her .  steeling myself , i put on a fake smile before stepping through the door .  hey , mandy ,  i say softly .  you feeling alright ?  newline newline amanda looked away from the tv , her face brightening .  what s the bouquet for ?  she smirked . newline newline  well , it s kind of a special occasion ,  i grinned .  we re going to switzerland tomorrow night !  newline newline her eyes widened in surprise .  really ? ! but i thought that would cost  newline newline  hey , what can i say ? the people on kickstarter really pulled through !  i lied . newline newline she let out a beautiful laugh , the first one i d heard in years . she pulls me down to kiss her , and for a brief moment , i forgot all about my crime . newline newline when we pull apart , her face is flush with emotion , like it was on our wedding day . however , the smile quickly faded away as her eyes slid behind me . i turn around to see that the news is on the tv . newline newline  police have yet to find the man responsible for the assassination of dr. abel galn , the pioneer of cancer treatment . acpd have yet to release any potential suspects , though they have reported that they are following several leads . there will be public funeral at st. michaels cathedral this saturday at noon .  newline newline amanda looks at me , worry in her eyes .  that would nt be anyone from work , would it ?  she asks knowingly . newline newline i put on an unconvincing grin .  something that highprofile ? nah , could nt be .  newline newline she raises an eyebrow at me .  then why are you holding those roses so tight ?  newline newline i look down to see that i had the bouquet in a death grip . loosening my fingers , i could that a rose thorn had stuck itself to my thumb , dripping blood down my hand . mr. president ! there s been a massive terrorist attack !  newline newline  dear god .  the president uttered solemnly , while he slowly removing his reading glasses , a move he practiced hundreds of times in preparation for this moment . he d always dreamed of carrying the nation through such a horrible tragedy . the fact that the news had been broken in front of a crowd of reporters was just icing on the cake . that this even sowed up his reelection did nt hurt either . this was his legacy , and he would handle it with dignity .  where ?  newline newline  it s , it s texas sir . houston . the blast radius covered the entire city .  newline newline he nodded , keeping his face calm . texas was his strongest political base . that would hurt , but the uptick in support from the rest of the country would more than make up for it .  i m declaring a state of emergency . america will weather this storm , just as it has all others . do we have casualty estimates yet ?  newline newline  uh ,  the chief of staff glanced around , seeming to notice the cameras for the first time . he seemed to be hesitating , caught between the urge for privacy and the fact that the president had just asked him a direct question .  we do sir .  newline newline  well ? spit it out . this is nt a time for political niceties . we re at war !  it was all the president could do not to smile . he could feel it , he d just uttered the soundbite that would define the rest of his presidency and impact on history . newline newline  none , mr. president . there were no casualties .  newline newline  what ?  the president asked , perplexed . newline newline  it was nt nuclear , sir . it was a smart bomb .  newline newline the president paused , not wanting to appear ignorant or uninformed during his seminal moment . newline newline  it makes people smarter , mr. president . iq points have jumped at least eighty points across the board .  newline newline the president held still , fighting to understand . why had harry charged in here like it was the end of the world ? he d been expecting a real crisis . what did it matter if people got a bit smarter ? newline newline  the electorate has been informed , sir .  newline newline at those words , it finally sunk in . the president went pale and broke out in a near instantaneous flop sweat . newline newline  they re demanding real answers to all the questions you dodged during the last debate and an honest political dialogue . twitter is exploding with criticisms about your new economic policy and handling of the situation in nicaragua . they also want to know why you ve implemented such a massively biased and secretive healthcare system , when an open system of competition and comparison would drop prices across the board . those are just the top items trending right now . demand for change and honesty is skyrocketing . half the city is in the streets , and the other half are already organizing other cities into new political parties . mr. president , what do we do ?  newline newline  oh sweet jesus no ... no !  he dropped his face into his hands , as cameras shuttered , capturing in high definition the honest reaction of the world s most powerful politician to a population too smart to be lied to .i glanced at the weather report on my phone confirming the forecast for rain today . weird timing though . i mean , that guy literally typed :  it begins raining outside ,  and bam , it starts raining . eh , what am i thinking , it was just a coincidence ... newline newline . newline newline  he looks up , and old sparks ignite .  newline newline . newline newline scoffing , i look toward the window and see jennifer with an umbrella in her hand . she s standing across the street from the coffee shop waiting for the light to turn . newline newline . newline newline  a thousand questions flood his mind as the thunder rolls .  newline newline . newline newline a rather loud peal of thunder bellows as jennifer dashes across the street towards the coffee shop . i begin to sweat as she opens the door and waits in line to order her coffee . what the hell ? ! it s been 6 years , what is she doing back in springfield ? i m officially weirded out  he must have gotten lucky with the thunder , right ? and the rain ... newline newline . newline newline  this time , ships were not to pass in the night .  newline newline . newline newline i read the last line with a look of horror  jennifer got her coffee and looked over to my table with a look of surprise . newline newline  jason ? oh my god ! is that really you ?  newline newline  who else could it be ?   really , jason ? get it together , man ...  newline newline  it feels like forever since i last saw you , i did nt think you d still be here , and especially not in a coffee shop !  newline newline  well , i ve begun to enjoy the atmosphere here and it s helped me with my writing  newline newline  writing ? wow ! here i thought you were going to be a boring old accountant , but now look at you ! a writer !  newline newline  well , when i m not teaching  i come here a lot during the summer to work on stuff ... so , why are you here in springfield ?  newline newline at that , the friend who never really was just a friend , was suddenly quiet and cast a look down at her hands , which finally gave me a chance to glance at the computer screen again . newline newline . newline newline  he grows concerned and asks her what s troubling her .  newline newline . newline newline you son of a  what s troubling her i mean , jennifer , what s troubling you ?  newline newline it takes her a while to reach my gaze , but when it does , it s a look of hurt and barely held back tears .  derek broke up with me . when i left the apartment , i did nt have anywhere to go , so i moved back in with mom and dad . so , yeah , that s why i m here .  newline newline i d only met derek once , and he seemed like a nice guy . i was genuinely happy for them , or at least i was after about 3 years . i guess at that point i just stopped caring . or so i thought . newline newline  god , jenny , i m really sorry to hear that . i know how tough it is staying in springfield when all of our friends have moved away  if you need anything just let me know .  newline newline i regretted saying those words as soon as they left my mouth . i reeeally did nt want to open these wounds again , or be a reboundee , and especially not both . newline newline  thank you , jason , you do nt know how much that means to me . well , i got ta run , i m gon na be late for dinner at my parents  .  newline newline i was relieved when she started moving away from the table . yet , the more i thought about it , the more i realized she was the most interesting thing to happen to me all summer . probably the last three summers . it was at that point that i realized she did nt have my number . in the background , i hear furious clacking ... newline newline . newline newline  she receives a call from her parents saying the turkey burned in the oven and they were stuck eating leftovers . she s on her own for dinner .  newline newline . newline newline holy shit . he did not just do that . of course , as i see him typing , the events transpire just as he typed them . who the hell was this guy ? ! jennifer hangs up and begins walking back toward my table ... newline newline  ummm , jason , i know this is a little sudden , but do you wan na grab dinner somewhere ? my dinner plans fell through a little unexpectedly .  newline newline the moment of truth . a simple  maybe another time  that never actually comes around . that s all i d have to say ... newline newline  sounds good to me , want to go to that italian place , maggiano s ? it s still got those awesome breadsticks and they ve introduced some new entrees since you ve been around .  newline newline the look on her face said it all . she beamed a smile   great ! i ve actually got to use the restroom real quick and then we ll go .  newline newline i got up slowly from the table and casually walked over to the man at the computer . as i approached , he closed the laptop and just looked at me with a grin . newline newline i stared levelly at him :  ok , why ?  newline newline he chuckles :  as a fellow writer , i know how important inspiration is . so , i gave you some  no need to thank me .  newline newline  did you orchestrate all of this ? !  newline newline  let s just say , i can see how a story can unravel . the setup was there , i just ... gave it a little push .  newline newline although my concept of the world i lived in had changed rather dramatically in that short time , i still had to say something . newline newline  thank you .  at that , the man nodded and went back to typing on his computer , but strangely , i could nt read what he was typing . jenny got out of the bathroom and we walked out towards maggiano s . it had stopped raining . newlinemy roommate and i sat in front of the tv watching the news replay footage of my ecapades last night . newline newline  dude , you ve set a new bar .  he deadpanned . newline newline i took a breath and exhaled slowly as the enormity of the trouble i was in set in . he handed me a joint and lit it for me . i took it and inhaled . i definitely needed it . newline newline i have a sleepwalking problem . it s usually pretty manageable if all the doors in the apartment are locked . but sometimes my roommate can be a dick and likes to leave a door or two unlocked so he could record my nightly preambles to show our friends later . newline newline he did nt get a chance this time but someone else did  the security guard at the stadium . he followed me , after failing to wake me up when i stumbled past his gatehouse . the camera followed me down to the field where i somehow got the guide ropes for the banner wrapped around my arm . as i walked further out onto the field i dragged the entire banner down with me , which turned out to be a quilt of flags . newline newline evidently i started dreaming about being attacked by snakes and started thrashing about . the guard laughed as i struggled with the ropes , tangling my feet in the quilt in the process . i fell and the guard laughed harder . eventually i got the ropes off my arm and stood up . i stomped on the  snake s  head and threw my arms up in triumph . the guard snorted in derision , followed by panicked shouts when i pulled out my lighter and set the corpse  on fire . newline newline the video cut off and the anchorman came back on , talking of demands for apologies by other countries . newline newline  it s alright .  my roommate said , in a half hearted attempt to cheer me up .  south africa did nt need the world cup this year .  newlinethe show was nt pulling good numbers anymore . all of the focus groups reported that , just as had happened with game of thrones , people were sick of watching sad tv . the writers kept writing in wars , terrorism , disease , financial upheaval and natural disasters , but the audience was responding to the brief moments of light hearted goodness . newline newline in fact the best performing episode in the last twelve months was about a company releasing a new all electric personal transporter . it was a geeky high tech quadcopter for two that had new high density batteries and could travel a few hundred miles . shell was pissed about that and had canceled its sponsorship . exon decided to pull its sponsorship of the mars show over it , even though it had nothing to do with the earth show . newline newline it was david who had this idea to go to a crowd funding site and pitch a new season . he wrote up a whole list of things he would nt add to the next season if we could extend the once mighty show one more year : newline newline none of the new episodes would introduce new wars , diseases , or gratuitous violence . newline newline each episode would include one uplifting story of goodness , generosity , or optimism for the future . the idea was to try to wrap up all of the loose ends created in the last few seasons . the writers figured that it would nt be possible to solve all of the shows problems in one season , but they were going to make a solid effort to make it a happier place . newline newline the response to the funding effort was stunning . as it turned out , people wanted a happier show . a new season would be written , sponsorship be dammed . there was no reason to be stuck in the past just because a few sponsors were not looking to the future . newline newline newline newline  edit : for clarity the stag lay in a circle of grass , beaten flat by his flailing efforts to stand . his gashed neck dripped blood slowly . he tried to gather his hooves underneath himself , but electric pain flowed down his body like honey from a cracked jar . a deep breath slipped from his gasping lungs  his eyes turned skyward and the light of the evening sun pierced him . his antlers dug small trenches in the dirt as his head lost the support of his neck . crows circled him , cackling . he stared , defeated  the white tail of the doe slipped in line behind the victor . newline it s not our fault  the two agents started generating a sigh from their supervisor newline newline  what s not your fault ?  she asked looking up from her monitor as it started lighting up . newline newline  agent 103 has been activated  the shorter of the two said newline newline  agent 103 ... agent 103 is a 5 year old , how d a 5 year old hear the phrase f  me with that orange fuzzy kumquat   she asked glancing down eyes bugging as she saw the many reports coming in from jon glancy elementary . newline newline  like we said it s not our fault , the teacher won the lottery and we never had figured her for a curser  the taller replied newline newline  a very creative curser  the other added newline newline  yes very creative  he said nodding newline newline  i do nt care how creative a curser she is , get down there and tell that mini terror their control phrase before they wreck the whole town  she said as the two men exchanged looks  what s problem ?  she asked newline newline  we never programmed in the control phrase  the shorter man replied newline newline  how could you not program in a control phrase ?  she asked gripping her desk as a new report came in about 103 hijacking a police cruiser seeming to be heading for the airport . newline newline  well like you said 103s only a kid we never thought he d be used in the field so we dragged our feet on finishing the programming .  newline newline  urgh , remind me to reassign you to our siberia office tomorrow . what do we do now ?  she asked looking at them newline newline  well if we move quick we can catch 103 while they re resting  newline newline  how do you know they ll be resting ?  newline newline  well maam it s almost nap time i remember it clearly just like i did everytime . the warm blood dripping , my muscles tense clutching the swiss army knife he had recently recieved from his parents . his parents would faint if they saw the high tech gadget covered with the red liquid . he smiled , how many small animals had he killed for fun . no mercy .  survival of the fittest ,  he chirpped nonchalantly . the corpse of the small cat lay before me , emotionless . though something caught my eye , gold orbs began to rise from the felines body . the small orbs rose to make a glowing sentence .  welcome to level two  i began to panic what heck was this . a prank ? no , technology had nt gone so far as to make that , and if it had they would nt be watching me kill cats . maybe it was a dream , i pinched the side of my arm . it left a sharp pain and indent that lingered in the backround . my eyes widened what i saw next . the gold orbs now formed the words  pick a skill ,  three words appeared before me . the first was regeneration , the second was increased jump . and i had to stop and reread the third . which in bold letters had the eerie word  death ,   what the hell is this ,  i questioned . this is one sick mind trick . i decided the best choice of action was to dismiss the notion that one could level up . so i went about my days as a school boy . it became harder and harder to focus though . the skills listed had expanded to take a great deal of my vison , forcing me to cock my head weirdly to look ahead . i decided that if this was real than i should just get it over with . i chose the regeneration skill and to my luck the window closed after revealing my increased stats . something felt strange on my arm , i glimpsed at it and to my suprise the pinch spot from several days ago was closing up at a speed unreasonable . it was creepy . how did something like leveling up go unoticed . the world has soldiers , why did nt they level up ? was it selective ? were there other ? i did decide one thing though , i needed to level up to gain the skills that came with it . to become the best . because the feeling of leveling up , the phenomenon . it felt good .the only light in the room came from the single bulb hanging from the ceiling . my handcuffs were chained to the table , my ankles cuffed to the chair , so there was nothing for me to do but wait for my mysterious visitor . the guards had refused to tell me anything about this meeting , except that it was happening . i was nt given much choice about that . i was nt given much choice about anything anymore . i almost looked forward to my last meal , because at least then what i wanted would be taken into consideration . newline newline finally the door opened . due to the dim light , i could nt see more than the shadowy forms of the people who entered the room , but i knew two of them well enough . donovan and mcnall , two of the prison s toughest , meanest guards . they stood on either side of the door while the third shadow , the stranger , stepped into the light , taking the form of a man i d never seen before . he was tall and lean , with closecut brown hair sprinkled with grey at the temples . he wore a dark , welltailored suit . newline newline  diana mcfarlane ,  he greeted me as he sat across from me .  convicted of dozens of murders , and sentenced to death.  he leaned across the table towards me .  how would you like to live instead ?  newline newline i raised an eyebrow at him .  i figured that offer was off the table.  newline newline  i have a special deal for you ,  the man said .  humanity has been given a rare chance by a certain benefactorthe chance to let all people live free from pain or sadness , save one . that one person will become immortal , but live in misery so that the rest of humanity can be happy.  newline newline i leaned back the fraction of an inch that my bound hands allowed .  how is this possible ?  newline newline  i m afraid i m not able to explain the how . i am here as a representative of all humankind , to offer you the opportunity of eternal life.  newline newline  and eternal misery ,  i said . newline newline  and eternal misery ,  he agreed . newline newline i tilted my head to the side .  why me ?  newline newline  because the people of the world were given a choice , and they decided that if anyone was going to make this sacrifice , it ought to be someone who already has nothing to lose , someone who deserves a life of punishment . those who have been sentenced to death seemed like the best candidates . i have approached a number of such candidates around the world already , and if any of them had taken the offer , we would nt be speaking . if you turn it down as well , i ll move on to the next name on my list.  newline newline  how long do i have to consider ?  newline newline  i m afraid i need an immediate answer . should you choose to accept the death penalty you ve already been condemned to , i ll need to leave right away . there are many out there who are anxious to find a willing participant in this sacrifice , you understand.  newline newline  eternal misery does nt sound like much fun ,  i mused . newline newline  and death does ?  newline newline  well , that depends on what comes after death . if there s nothing , then , well , i have nothing to look forward to . but if there s any kind of life after death , odds are i d be headed straight for hell and eternal misery anyway , so what s the difference ?  newline newline the man folded his hands together .  there may be no difference to you , but a world of difference to the families and friends of your victims . they would no longer have to mourn the losses of their loved onesloved ones that you , yourself , took away from them . you could be the one to ease their pain.  newline newline i looked down at my hands on the table .  if i cared about that , do you think i would have killed all those people in the first place ?  newline newline  i think that if i keep asking , i ll eventually find someone ready to atone.  newline newline i was silent , considering his words . on the one hand , i could nt imagine a world where no one felt sorrow for the loss of their loved ones . in my experience , sadness sucked , but it made happiness that much more awesome when you could get it . if all you knew was happiness , would you ever really notice how happy you were ? newline newline on the other hand , i could take away pain that i had personally inflicted on so many survivors , and would nt that make a better justice than just having my own life taken ? if i stayed and was put to death , my victims  families might feel avenged , but they would be happier if i took this deal . i could nt pretend i did nt feel my guilt . maybe i could make up for some of my crimes , at least . newline newline i raised my eyes without lifting my head .  i m your girl.  newline newline the corner of the man s mouth lifted in a small smile .  you understand that you will not be released from prison ? you will live out the rest of your eternal life here . you are still a convict , and in all honesty , no one outside these walls will want their happiness marred by the sight of your misery.  newline newline that stung a little , but i shrugged .  hey , you never said anything about letting me free . only letting me live . i mean , it seems like people could thank me for taking on all of their pain and sadness and suffering by at least letting me go home , but if i m going to be miserable anyway i guess it does nt really matter where i am.  newline newline  and you re sure about this ?  newline newline  ca nt say i m really sure about anything . but i agree to this.  newline newline the man reached across the table , taking my hand for an awkward halfhandshake .  it s been a pleasure doing business with you , mrs. mcfarlane.  newline newline as his hand left mine , i was filled with dread , quickly followed by a wave of the most bitter sadness i d ever known . i almost choked on my own breath as it overtook me , and i started to panic .  wait ,  i cried out ,  wait , i i  newline newline  i m afraid it s too late . humanity thanks you for your sacrifice.  the man stood and rolled his shoulders back , his smile widening .  i feel better already.  newline newline my shoulders shook as i lowered my head to the table and sobbed .in 2213 , jesus came to earth . newline newline though pluto was discovered in 1930 , it was nt until the early 2000s that other dwarf planets were discovered in the outer solar system . still , it seems strange that one of the largest , jesus , was nt discovered until 2095 , over 1.5 centuries after pluto . the story , widely believed apocryphal , is that it was named for what an astronomer yelled just after calculating the object s orbit . it stuck because it was apparently the only name deemed fitting for an object who s arrival would bring the apocalypse . newline newline the years between 2108  after most of the world s politicians were finally convinced that the threat was nt merely part of some sinoamerican plot to conquer african nations for their uranium  and 2212 were an unprecedented period of preparation . superbunkers were dug under most of the world s mountain ranges . wars were fought , killing billions , to determine who would control and populate the bunkers . and finally , the bunkers were stocked with everything they were expected to need . in 2210 , after its closest pass with jupiter , it was determined that jesus would impact the southern hemisphere at a shallow angle , turning most of africa and south america into atmospheric dust  and possibly a second moon  . i would have loved to have seem the faces of the dictators and generals who sent countless human soldiers to die for the african and south american bunkers , only to earn a front row seat to the largest explosion earth had seen in billions of years . newline newline in 2213 , 10000 people , including my ancestors , sealed themselves in the south montana bunker . there are no records on how those specific people were chosen , so i d guess they walked over the stillwarm corpses of their neighbors . it was considered one of the most promising locations : the rockies were overhead and it linked to a uranium mine that could power the reactors for longer than humans had existed . the bunker was stocked with computers and robots that would control and maintain everything required to provide electricity , food , water , air , and medical supplies , as well as work the mines , repair aging structures and apply medical care . the 10000 were set for eternity . newline newline now , in 2431 , here s how it is : people wake when they re too hungry or bored to keep sleeping , eat a breakfast of genetically engineered algae and mushroom  my parents apparently got canned vegetables on special occasions and my grandparents even remember having canned meat or fruit once or twice . they were apparently wealthy and powerful back when that still mattered .  , watch some 20th and 21st century television on the archive computer , eat more algae , watch more tv , possibly call for a sex robot , and eventually go back to sleep . newline newline the other day , i walked east through the tunnel system . i saw no one , of course  i have nt seen anyone walking in the tunnels in the past year or two . but for the first time in many years , i found something new : robots digging a tunnel up from the bunker . it appeared straight , but i could nt see the end of it . after returning to my quarters , i read everything i could find about it . apparently , they ve been digging for the past 200 years , but it s been slow because they do nt know what to expect and therefore have to dig carefully and install a highpressure airlock every so often . newline newline scientists before the impact left lots of opinions on what could happen . the old mountains could have been buried by even larger ones , or they could have been destroyed , leaving a lake or ocean at any depth , ready to drown us all . jesus  impact was expected to transfer enough angular momentum to slow or even stop the earth s rotation , but there is no information on how long a day currently is or whether the sun is overhead or not . there is no information on the state of the atmosphere . it s unlikely any plant life would survive the nuclear winter , so there may be no more oxygen . there may be toxic chemicals or newlyevolved deadly bacteria . it s possible that all of the water vapor has frozen on the dark side , if the earth is rotating slowly enough and has lost enough atmosphere . there may be a mountain of ice over us right now . there may not even be an atmosphere at all given the combination of the impact and the failing of earth s magnetic field due to the loss of rotation . newline newline i ca nt seriously believe that anyone expected humans to move back to the surface . that s the kind of hope used to fool children . there s no way any of the saved plant or animal genomes will ever be used to recreate those organisms and release them into the wild . we ll never leave this bunker and the remnants of humanity will never become more than a mockery of what they once were . that s why i m done . i refuse to go on . newline newline i ve removed the control rods from the reactors and i know the robots ca nt manufacture and install new ones quickly enough to save even one of them from a meltdown . i ve left you all this note so you ll know what s happening when alarms activate and then the lights go out . this nightmare is finally going to end . you re welcome .the procession had long since passed , leaving the street barren and empty . the usual collection of litter and other substances  some of which were probably best left unexamined  had replaced the solemn march of feet . a visitor to the city would have had no idea that a funeral had just taken place ... though sergeant fred colon viewed the refuse as being a sign of a respect , a collective promise from the city to go on in the wake of such a terrible loss . newline newline he sniffed mightily , as though the constant suction of air through his nose might keep the tears from streaming down his face . beside him , corporal  nobby  nobbs kept a pensive silence . newline newline  i mean ...  began fred , seemingly in response to some inner thought ,  that s it , then , innit ?  newline newline  what s it , fred ?  asked nobby . newline newline the larger man idly adjusted his illfitting armor .  it s , you know ... death . it s going to happen . it s coming for us . only a matter of time now .  newline newline nobby considered this . although his brain was not particularly wellsuited for the task of contemplating anything beyond the existence of jam donuts , the words from his friend had apparently dislodged something in a deep corner of his mind . the internal crack allowed just the barest glint of wisdom to shine through , igniting neural passages that had lain dormant for years . newline newline  the way i see it ,  nobby replied ,  the way i see it is ... well , he was dead before , right ?  newline newline fred aimed a curious glance downward .  how do you mean ?  newline newline  i mean ... i mean before he was born , he was dead , right ?  nobby nodded along with his own thought .  it stands to reason . if he s not alive , then he s dead .  newline newline  supposing he was a zombie , though ?  asked fred . it was a strange sensation , being on the receiving end of nobby s wisdom ... and yet , not a wholly unpleasant one .  zombies are both alive and dead .  newline newline nobby nodded .  right , fred , right ... but maybe it s like a door ? on one side you re dead , on the other you re alive , and zombies do nt have the decency to go all the way through .  newline newline  blocking it up for all the people just trying to get outside !  growled fred .  do you suppose that s how zombies come about ? maybe they re all blocked from going outside by one fellow what wo nt make up his mind ?  newline newline  stands to reason !  newline newline fred pounded a fist into his open hand .  well , that wo nt do , will it ? loitering , that is ! we ca nt have a zombie keeping such a great man from getting outside , now can we ?  newline newline  what re we going to do , fred ?  asked nobby . with that question , the universe righted itself , and the glint that had struggled to shine in nobby s mind snuffed itself out in frustration . newline newline  i ll tell you what we re going to do ,  fred replied .  we re going to get out there and get those zombies to move !   newline newline  politely , though , fred ?  newline newline  of course , nobby ,  fred answered .  of course . no call to go being rude about it . we ll ask politely . maybe ask them to see reason . tell them about our friend . any decent person would move aside , what ?  newline newline  supposing they arent decent , though , fred ?  newline newline sergeant fred colon cracked each of his knuckles in sequence , a habit he had nt practiced since ... well , it had only been last week , but this time was meaningful .  well , nobby ,  he said ,  if they are nt decent ... we wo nt be either .  newline newline the two men puffed up their chests and continued to guard the empty street . newline newline in the shadows behind them , the transparent figure of a bearded man grinned mischievously .i wrote this a while back for a writing exercise , it s pretty basic and needs some editing , but i m proud of it . it s based on a real experience , unfortunately . newline newline bad trip newline newline the air is becoming awful , a sickly sweet humidity that drenches your body in a sticky sheen of sweat . what clothes that touches your skin soaks and clings , forcing the feverish heat within to intensify where it connected . beginning to gasp through your breathing , you set the pipe beside empty bottles and cough . they had said it was strong , promising through grins that the high would last the night . truth or lie , the alcohol assured it would . the last few hits had made the thrumming of your heartbeat into an aching that went from sternum to throat , vibrating each with every beat . you decide through wordless thoughts you wo nt have anymore . if the sweating was nt bad enough , the churning , swirling sensation in your head was only becoming more intense . strange , unsolicited thoughts come as quickly as they pass , as formless as they are pointless , fragments and threads that went nowhere . by instinct , you stare ahead at the street through the blurring lag of your vision like you might a work of art , searching for meaning and pattern though inarticulately . a realization strikes , dulled by the increasing sway of your mind , that your thoughts do not come or cease at your will  you no longer control your thoughts . uncomfortable , heart quickening its beat , there is an increasing desperate moment of focus . the sensation of a weightless vortex within your head is building more and more intense . forcing focus , you look at your wrist . the display shows 08:15 pm glowing a dull green . newline newline too much smoke , too fast , it was still catching up . you close your eyes , now somewhat urgently willing focus and control . the void yawns silently , deepening , drawing thicker around you in depth and control . an intense weight and current , all thoughts surrender utterly to the sensation of spinning back and over . fear flushes your body as the sensation builds exponentially , as if your head were pulled back against a waterfall that flowed from every direction at once . your eyes widen quickly , any actions taken now driven by instinct . trees , cars , the street all shimmer like reflections in water as the image and your head roll back . the staccato thrumming of your heartbeat is painful , pumping battery acid through clenching veins either side your neck . panting , the great pull of the void softens as eyes opened widely staring intently ahead . they grasp for a point of reference , an anchor , stability . the chill that creeps from toes through ligaments and up your spine is like freezing water , forcing a tense , cold sweat . a tight blink becomes a nod , and the grit of concrete against hair is not enough to draw you back from the void s renewed embrace . newline newline the sensation becomes manifest and seizes . raw , roaring sound building . feeling , like within a tire , conscious as it begins to spin . shifting in weight , hard pressure on the left half . panic . a duration . movement . the tire spins faster . intensity . consciousness falling round and back . up side down . hanging . panic . sweat . churn . falling . the body seizes . intensity . whimpering whispers , gasps . aching . ringing in ears destroying thought . panic . a duration . hands grasping , squeeze grey matter . tears , hot . shaking . vibrating . deafening ringing roar . shuddering pain . a duration . intensity . wall of noise . tire spins faster . eyes widen , all a blur , new angle . green glowing . squeezing pressure through head , focus , sight . numbers and letters : newline newline 08:21 pmhe lost the fight . newline newline it lasted one minute , four seconds . i know because i watched the footage of it later on youtube , where some scum had posted it . a minute and four seconds does nt sound like long , but when someone is punching you constantly only pausing to kick your ribs and arms and chest , time stretches into eternity until you re almost convinced that that moment is all life is . newline newline stupid thing was , john knew he d lose before he began . the one punch he threw to start the fight was all he had , and it was weak . his balance was horrendous , his arms were so thin you could practically see through them , and his fist had his thumb tucked into it . into it . john broke his own thumb with that first punch , and the other guy , my ex , hardly blinked from the contact . newline newline the punch glanced off my ex s cheekbone with only a red spot to mark the hit . he actually smiled before he punched john back . his perfectly executed crosshook smashed into john s jaw and sent him staggering back . i knew he d pulled his strength a bit , because john stayed conscious and his jaw stayed whole . it was nt out of kindness . newline newline  john , do nt !  i shouted , knowing the disdainful challenge for what it was , but john shook his head to free his vision from stars and stepped forward again . john knew what would happen . he d seen my face , the size of my ex , and his own diminutive height . he was nt stupid . he was just  newline newline on the ground , with two jabs and a broken nose , standing up and swaying , catching a punch on his skinny arm , then another on his eye . groaning as a fist closed his left eye and another broke a rib . slamming into the sidewalk , rolling , and standing to take more . he was  newline newline amazing . newline newline i did nt sit there stupid and helpless , like i had when my ex first hit me . but at fivefootnothing , i was a gnat buzzing at his ear . a casual swipe sent me into the nearest store s brick wall with enough force my vision went dark . then it was john s turn to yell , with what little he had in his lungs , and throw himself at my ex . newline newline the next punch knocked him out , and another kick rolled him over . my ex sneered at the two of us , sprawled below him on cracked concrete . his breaths were even , his eyes mocking .  pathetic ,  was all he said before he spit and walked away . newline newline i did nt bother to respond , just half crawled , half lunged towards john , and no one helped . newline newline one minute , four seconds . five of those were me sobbing as i begged john to open his eyes . newline newline john did  well , one of them .  stupid ,  i said , choking on tears and relief .  that was so stupid .  newline newline his cracked , bloody lips turned up at the edges .  yea ,  he said with a groan .  but stupid was right . i ca nt believe this shit . newline newline why did i go to hell for this ? newline newline was beating this asshole to death with a scale replica of the space battle ship yamato really not okay with god ? newline newline i adjust my fedora and straighten my trench coat . the fucker i beat to death is looking at me funny . i start weaving justsu signs at him and he scampers off to a crowd of demons . they were menacing him with razor edged dildos , but my ninja skills are way intense than what they were doing to his ass . newline newline just then i realized . suicide is a sin . after killing this idiot for talking shit about my little pony i slipped on my apple jack pony blanket and cracked my head . newline newline i m being punished for  sort of  killing myself . i realize that this is god s way of saying ending my life was wrong . by that reasoning my life had an inherit value of some sort or i would nt be punished . newline newline i just realized some one out there thinks i m worth something . i am 36 years old and this is the greatest eternity of my life .the sodden , raw fabric clung to my shoulders with a desperation that fed my frenzy to get it off . scrabbling , i clawed first at the collar then at the seams . i had started with the buttons but my hands had shook too much , and my motor skills seemed to deteriorate the more i struggled . newline newline it might seem funny that i was trying to strip in a cold , dark and rainy october night , but the situation was beyond anything i can convey through these words . newline newline newline halloween night , you say ? a joy filled holiday filled with sweet and sour ? newline newline did you know that more crimes occur over halloween weekend than any other time

of them . in fact , do nt wear anything at all . your sanity is your most precious resource right now , and anything is a risk to that . can i offer you another cup of tea , princess ?  newline newline  no , no thank you .  newline newline  another cookie ?  newline newline  no , thanks . are you sure he ca nt get here ?  newline newline  princess , i promise you , you re safe here . i could

gestured at the warding cage he had created just for her protection . if worse comes to worst , we will secure you in there , and there s almost nothing he can do about it . please ... relax .  newline newline a tear rolled down her cheek , and another , and she slowly placed her face in her hands .  you have no idea ,  she said dully .  he can be so ... driven at times . and he s always there . always !  she jerked her head up to look at him .  all . the . time !  he s there in the castle !  when im outside he has to be outside ! when i m talking to anyone he has to be there , listening ! newline i ... i just ca nt take another day of it ...  newline newline  princess ... .  a minion crashed through the door and tripped over it s own feet . picking itself up , he saluted and said ,  master ! it s time to secure the princess . he s through the seventh portal and has entered your realm .  newline he nodded , and turned to the princess .  your highness , it s time to secure you in the warding cage . here ,  he handed the shaking woman the plate of dainties ,  take this while you wait inside . please , forgive me . i must retire to the antechamber and prepare my final magics .  newline she grabbed at his arm and asked ,  you wo nt let him through , will you ?  newline newline  no , princess . i will protect you with my life .  newline newline crying , she could only nod . shaking harder with every step , she walked to the warding cage . the minion gently helped her inside and sealed the gate . grinning , he tossed her a thumbs up before taking post at the door of the room . newline newline taking hold of the golden bars of the cage , she looked out at the now closed door , and the minion standing guard over her .  please , master bowser ,  she whispered .  please stop him , and end this nightmare for all .  she sank to the floor of the cage , buried her face in her hands , and began to weep .elsewhere . newline newline he had been walking for the past ... what was it ? minutes ? years ? it felt good to be able to walk again . that shell of a body was getting too ... stuffed . like the house of your childhood , that now seems like a trap . he was able to thing straight again , after so many years . he patiently waited , as they had left the room . newline newline then he came . just like he had written him . black , and white , with eyes of a crystalline fire . newline newline  there is some ... trouble.  newline newline  oh ?  newline newline  a couple of people have asked me to get you to them.  newline newline a long silence followed . then , death lifted his scythe , and with a few quick cuts , the figure stood free . newline newline  it hurts a bit to lave them like this.  newline newline  you have done more then you think for them ... and me  newline newline  really ? all i did was write stories.  newline newline  you enchanted the minds of millions . you were a good husband  and father . and you gave me cats.  newline newline the man took his leather hat , and his vest , and stood up . newline newline  i am ready  newline newline  no questions ?  newline newline  ca nt think of any . i am honestly curious of hat comes after.  newline newline he looked up to death , as they stood still . . newline newline  you know ... i am supposed to tell you that there is a vastness of sand . but you have figured this out . however  i sometimes make mistakes . when someone takes a step back  who knows where they ... .  newline newline he felt the hole closing . all he had done was admit to a tiny mistake . he was contempt . newline newline the hall of the unseen university smoldered . according to rough calucualtions , that ponder performed on the fly , just that simple generator had overheated , and had shot 50.000 thaum in energy ... . where ? who cared ? if this worked ... newline newline as the smoke lifted , he saw the man standing there . trousers of some blue material , a leather vest , and a hat . looked a bit like one of the fourexian newline exchange students they often had over . newline newline he carefully approached him . newline newline  i am sorry  , he said , as he switched to the fourexian accent .  i gave hex the wrong set of coordinates . it must be a terrible mistake ... .  newline newline he stopped , as the stranger looked at him . he was old , just the right age for a professor . newline newline  you must be ponder , right ?  newline newline it was a bit creepy . the smile , the hat , the glasses ... all of it seemed too familliar . newline newline  ponder stibbons , sir .  , he said , feeling a bit uncomfortable .  have we met before ?  newline newline the stranger turned around , and looked at the great hall . looked at the heaps of smoldering furniture . newline newline  this is the unseen university , ahnk morpork , right ?  newline newline ponder stopped a bit . newline newline  sir , the question may seem stupid , but are you qualified to be a professor ? have you published anything ? i told hex to get the best fit for the professor of cultural studies , and i am thinking there may be a mistake  newline newline the question seemed unimportant , but as the stranger turned around , he had tears running down his beard . he stepped forward , and enclosed the now totally confused stibbons in a hug . newline newline  you can say that . my name is ... .  the stranger paused for a second , and then smiled .  pterry . sir pterry . what would i be supposed to teach ?  newline newline ponder nodded carefully , and wrote it down . newline newline  well , pterry , since hex picked you , you must be qualified to teach about all the cultures of the discworld . you do get a travel budget , a small office in the unseen univcersity , and you are free to publish books when you like , but the archchancellor lets you know that less then one per year , and he will have a word with you.  newline newline instead of the reaction stibbons expected , the man smiled , and nodded . newline newline and so , ponder helped the new professor for cultural studies , pterry , to clean himself off , and to take him to the tailors . newline newline the end .sarah squints a little as she looks at the small display of her wristphone . new unread messages keep appearing with a slight haptic buzz . she wiggles her wrist slightly to scroll through the messages and focuses on one . she whispers ,  call contact  and puts her wrist up to her ear . newline newline  i am so glad you called me ,  exclaims the voice on the

she focuses her mind and slowly fades into invisibility . she stares at her hand as it disappears from sight . she stands up , looks at her nonreflection in the mirror , giggles , and says ,  i still do nt believe this  as she wiggles her hips and waves her arms , trying to spoil the illusion . newline newline still invisible , sarah goes out for a walk , people watching , and texting her friends photos from places she could nt walk into before . she was taking a picture of a selfflushing urinal when she felt a hand on her shoulder . newline newline  hi , i m dr. vertigo and i hope you and i can be friends ,  says a man in a purple and green outfit wearing a facemask that only reveals his eyes . newline newline sarah blushes , involuntarily becomes visible , and gives a slight yelp as he says ,  let me guess , the jerks at super inc have already offered you some kind of douchebag deal that you would nt take in a million years . i can offer you so much more !  newline newline sarah remains quiet , still shocked at being caught in the men s room . newline newline  let s go somewhere , err less janitorial , to talk ,  says dr. vertigo as he holds up his control rod , points it toward the cement brick wall , and disintegrates a personsize hole into it . outside , a small open cockpit aircar appears and parks itself right next to the hole . he then smacks his control rod down onto the tile of the men s room , bows , and says ,  ladies first .  newline newline sarah pauses for a moment , looks at the two seater aircar , and says ,  i m not so sure of this .  newline newline dr. vertigo holds out his hand gracefully to help her into the aircar as men peering out of the stalls stare in bewilderment . one man yells ,  some crazy broad is in the men s room !  dr. vertigo spins around and smacks him in the head with his control rod . the man collapses to the floor . vertigo says ,  ugh the men s room floor , such filth ,  as he pushes the unconscious man out of the way using his boot heel . newline newline sarah grins and says ,  okay . ten minutes , that s it .  newline newline  ten minutes is all i ll need ,  he replies with a wink . newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlineleather shoes trudge through the city streets with tan socks hiding behind their cover . the soles of these shoes finding water where there is little else . the ends of a fine pair of pants damp from a particularly deep puddle , the man curses . he seeks refuge in a convenient alleyway illuminated by a neon sign , the sign read  new yung foo  . the man does not think twice on this strange occurance , a place to dry and nothing more is what he sought for . the click of a metal knob gives way to a darkened room lit by aged lanterns hanging from the rafters . newline newline the man steps forward cautiously taking in the worn red paint lathered upon the walls , the gold that has tarnished with dust and grown sticky with the oil in the air . the wood that once traced ornate shapes through the restaurant has long since begun to rot , the red lacquer failing to conceal the age . he moves a hand towards his mouth as though to protect himself from the scent of decay . his hand is grasped by another long before it completes its transit . newline newline  hello sir , my name is jinlan  the young oriental man said  will you be dining with us today ?  newline newline  ah , hello , i m just looking for a place to dry.  the man replied . newline newline  your name , sir ?  jinlan inquired . newline newline  jim . you can call me jim . where could i find your bathroom ?  he replied dismissively . newline newline  i m sorry sir , customers only.  jinlan responded reflexively . newline newline with a disgruntled sigh , jim took jin up on the offer to dine if only to see that his pants would fully dry . he had no intent of staying when he had entered and even now he would much rather leave as quickly as possible . there was a strange feeling that welled up within him as he was drawn to the dining area . his server had motioned towards one of the tables towards the front of the house and drawn up a menu . newline newline  now , about that bathroom ...  jim began . newline newline jinlan pulled a towel off his arm ,  here you are sir , we ve been waiting.  jin said handing over the towel .  let me know when you are ready.  he said as he walked away . newline newline jim was quite dumbfounded by the server s response . he wiped off his hands and then his pants while mulling over the situation he found himself in . eventually he thought to himself ,  nah , he s just pulling my leg.  and thought little else of it .  surely he said it in jest , with a place like this i m sure it gets rather dull around here . well , if he does a good job i ll make sure to leave a large tip.  newline newline in the center of the table sat a golden bell that was anchored to a rich wood platform . the light shone down onto the bell and caught jim s eye . glancing over the menu , he decided to give it a ring . newline newline the server emerged from the shadows , holding a large platter covered by a dome on one arm and cradling a smaller tray of drinks with the other .  yes ?  was his reply . newline newline  i ve decided what i will have . i believe i will go with the house special and a nice cup of tea.  jim replied with a smile that would soon give way . newline newline with a swift hand jin removed the dome from the platter , laying out a bowl of thick beef broth studded with vegetables wrapped in silky noodles . this bowl was paired with a small rectangular plate of crisp and succulent egg rolls that filled the room with their aroma . the food had far outclassed the place in which they were made and completely baffled the customer . his mouth stood agape as jinlan placed a delicate cup filled with pitchblack tea and turned to leave . it was then that jim piped up , lost in the atmosphere of the place and the enigma of their service . newline newline  what are you trying to pull here ?  jim spoke with a raised voice . newline newline  yes sir , i m quite sorry.  jin responded placing down two small saucers brimming with sauce .  it is rare that i forget such simple things.  jinlan said with a smile as he slipped away . newline newline jim sat in silence for several minutes and had yet to touch any of the items nearly half an hour later . this place was surely one of a kind and filled him with unease . the strange feeling that once welled up within him now formed stones that weighed heavily in his pit . these emotions he tried to drown in the food and drink that lie before him with no success . the worse he felt , the less he could taste the immaculate course . he ate for several hours , the food never depleted fully as he gorged upon the feast . newline newline blindly bright lights slashed before his eyes for but a moment and then they were gone . he sat down the food so that he could wipe away the residue that had remained upon his eyes . he began to clutch at his meal once more when he heard sirens in the distance . a common occurrence that jim thought little of . as he bit into another egg roll , he heard a terrible crash just outside the restaurant which caused him to leap from his seat . jinlan appeared at his side once more . newline newline  is everything to your liking ?  jin asked . newline newline  yes ... yes , i do believe so.  jim lied still reeling from the commotion he thought he heard outside .  did you hear that awful racket ?  newline newline  no sir , it s been very quiet tonight.  jin replied brandishing the check .  i can not remember a night that it has been this profoundly silent.  newline newline jim paid the check in full with several dollars to spare for the young man , and began to head for the exit before jin stopped him . he was holding a very small plate that held a single cookie in the shape of a cloven hoof . a slightly sweet smell waft from the golden shape to jim s nostrils . he reached out and took the cookie from the plate while the server explained . newline newline  this is a fortune cookie , our finest treat . inside this cookie you will find a piece of paper , be careful not to eat the paper itself . read it silently and tell no one , finish off the cookie and see that your fortune comes true . those are quite popular here and we ve yet to receive a complaint.  jin said with a satisfied look . newline newline jim did as jin had instructed , reading his fortune as he munched on the crunchy treat .  conquer your fears or they will conquer you.  was written on a pale scrap of paper in dark ink and circulated through jim s mind . he breathed in through his nose , bypassing the fullness of his maw . the air was sharp and made him cough heavily , he winced at the bright lights just above his face . he tried to move but could nt , focusing instead on the distorted sounds around him that came in as though he were trapped underwater . slowly faces came into focus as he slipped back into the lobby of the restaurant . newline newline jim thanked his server and headed for the door , clutching the piece of paper in his right hand . he remembered what he had feared most . death . he struggled to return to the scene where he lay , the faces and voices of others calling out to him . he wondered how he had arrived there and found himself in such a predicament . with a great deal of effort , he was able to bring the fortune to his face .  we ca nt help everyone . but everyone can help someone.  he finally remembered the face of the little girl that he had thrust out of harm s way . her blonde hair fell about her tiny shoulders and her eyes so full of life . he had to help her , he had to save her . newline newline through pained gasps and broken words he asked ,  is she okay ?  newline newline  yes  the medic replied ,  just lay still , help is on its way.  newline newline sirens rang out in the distance but jim adamson had made his peace . he walked into the brilliant lights before his eyes filled with warmth and fearing nothing , not even death . he led the way as he passed on that thursday night at the age of fortytwo . his memorial will be held on saturday and donations will be made to the nearest children s hospital . the event will be catered by new yung foo . nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  when the boy awoke he would turn his head towards the walls and see the universe ripple and bubble around him . he felt vile like sweets rotting in his

or how long it has been . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   i see you re awake my child .  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  the boy was startled from his mock sleep . he sat

nbsp   nbsp   i want to go home sir ,  said the boy askance . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   you ve come so far ,  ignored the man ,  we re almost there . the place i want to show you .

 we re on the human adventure my boy ,  returned the man ,  he and the others ca nt all come along .  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   why .  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   i m sorry .  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  the bleakness of outside began to simmer down . the man saw this and jumped to his console . from darkness came swirling form . impossibly large clouds every color imaginable lingered motionless all around them . the boy could not help but be transfixed by the grandeur like tapestries lit by starlight . he would remember this . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  the man went into a frenzy . he began pulling knobs and cranks and regained the cadence and the rush of his alarming excitement .  we re scientists you see ,  he spoke to the air ,  explorers ! secret heroes of the world that does nt deserve us . that is why i keep my marvels close to me . that is why i searched for an heir . to winnow the little people who would just fritter it all away . my boy we have traveled far beyond space and time and only you are worth the journey . come . i want you to see this .  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  the boy felt warmth against his cheek . he turned his head and beyond the dancing madman he saw the sun rise . down below was a world like a marble . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   look what could have been child . another earth .  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  the boy could only feel his heart break at the familiarity . he did not utter a word . it was useless now . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  they hurtled down in the way they did coming up . they soared above oceans and crested mountains . before long they were above a forest . the boy could see nothing but trees of garish colors going onto forever . a bell chimed . doors slipped away . the man stepped out and motioned the boy to follow . he was met with sweltering heat and an alien world . the man doffed his hat . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   welcome , charlie . welcome to oompa land . your kingdom . thick brown vines curled through the broken glass frame that made up the exterior of the now broken greenhouse . the smell of decay was an oppressive force that permeated every corner of the derelict structure . even the very earth below him seemed to have long since given up trying . it was scabbed over with death , it  s potential buried under years of neglect newline newline thomas hobbled along the outside , letting his rough hand drag across the filthy glass and rusted framework . as the wind blew across the surface , the old structure would creak and cry out . ever since ellie passed he would come back to their old project once a year . he couldn  t keep it up after she was gone , there were too many memories here and the soil had turned sour . it was overwhelming even now , every smell and sound reminded him of her . through the rotting stench he could still smell her lilies she planted in the center . newline newline its bloom was framed perfectly on all sides by the dried husks of plants long forgotten . a beam of sunlight managed its way in giving them a warm glow amidst the ruin . thomas gave a broken smile , limping inside . he kneeled onto his good leg , and cupped the flower in his hand savoring the fragrance . it was the only thing that he could still keep alive in this forsaken place . newline newline the small black phone on the back wall let out a ring , bringing him back to the present . with effort he stood again , and made

, but for how long who could tell . the human missiles has been pounding the planetary defences for nearly a week now and while they had not yet cracked or allowed any of their terrifying missiles through , it was only a matter of time . newline newline on planets across the galaxy the routine had been the same . massive bombardments were made by the human dreadships , until the planetary defence systems could no longer cope and began to lose power and gaps appeared . soon the missiles would rain down on the main power stations and habitation pods and millions would die . once the planet was helpless the invasion would begin . countless waves of their soldiers were ferried to the surface on small but powerful landing ships , blasting everything in their path and then swarming across the land . newline newline it had been their strength , the humans had vast numbers and could breed at an incredible rate . it was said that a human child could go from birth to fighting in only 6 revolutions and a female could bear thirty children in a lifetime . we foolishly thought that our advanced technology could counter their vast numbers , but we were wrong . every life lost was hundreds of revolutions of knowledge and growth , irreplaceable and unique . in that time whole generations of humans would be born , grow , fight and die . newline newline we had first encountered humans on noprot 4 , a small outpost where a mining colony of 200 had lived for five hundred revolutions . the humans had arrived in primitive ships and at first our two species had been incredibly friendly . we had never met another sentient species and the terraxion people had exploded in joy and happiness that we were no longer alone in the world . newline newline they were such a young species and so primitive still , we had tried to understand them better but they had not understood why we felt the need to dissect so many of their people . they were so many though and the loss of a few had allowed us to develop the communication pods , which had led to fluent and frequent speech between the species and the beginning of real understanding . newline newline early misunderstandings had faded and the trade of knowledge , ideas and technology had been free and created new revolutions on each of our planets . we shared our knowledge of the stars , terraforming and faster than light travel and they had shared medical , electronic and communication technology . we didn  t realise then that they would so quickly learn and improve what we gave them and our scientists took it as an affront when they offered the improved technology back to us . the humans did not understand the proper concept of tradition and we did not realise how far and fast they would grow . newline newline the first casualties came by misunderstanding , as they always do . the humans had found a planet they wished to colonise and in thirty rotations had set up a colony and started mining . they were not aware of the proper system of claims that all terraxions abide by and the extermination of several million of their species was taken badly by their government . newline newline trade ceased and humans withdrew to their space and did not come close to us and the terraxions mourned . we had lost our friends . when then reached out again after 100 rotations we rejoiced and welcomed them back to us , but it was to be short lived . the humans had further changed and developed our technology and sadly they had made several fatal errors . the judiciary was called together and it was determined that while humans meant no affront , the only course of action was to remove the offending technology from their use . newlinethe mother sat on her bed , a private ward in a private hospital . she felt quite alone in that moment . 9 months ago she was homeless , poor , freezing from the cold ... some guys in suits offered her all the money she could dream of to be a surrogate mother , why not ! ? they chose her because she was stupid and desperate enough to say yes , she realised , and she supposed her name probably appealed to someone s sick sense of humour too . newline newline now she wishes she had said no . the baying crowds outside , thirsty for her blood . the pains in her stomach . the constant controversy and media debate around her and her son . and oh god , she thought would give birth , collect her cheque and go ... but this was her son ! as the feotus grew inside her , so did the sense of love , and care , she would never leave him to the men in suits . she thought of the one line in the bible she could remember from sunday school , and it sort of felt right..  oh god , why have you forsaken me ?  newline newline and then she noticed him . a tall , handsome man , wavy locks of hair , a warm smile . he wore a white that was so brilliant it seemed to shine , and unlike the clinical and sterile white of the hospital room , this white seemed to shine with warmth . she panicked for a moment . newline newline  do nt be afraid . i m not here to hurt you . i ve been sent by god . i am gabriel . come with me mary . take my hand .  newline newline  where are we going ?  mary stammered . newline newline  jerusalem . when the world needs you most . you have to give birth mary  newline newline her head hurt from the confusion , but all she could think about was her son , how this ... whatever it was ... was an opportunity to keep her son away from those men . newline newline  mary , you are mary . the mother of the son of man , the mother of jesus . you are her , and he is him .  newline newline i am her.. that mary ? she thought . and he is him ? newline newline  it is time.. come with me mary  gabriel said , his hand outstretched . and she followed him .they d met before , though neither was sure when or where . already a seasoned consultant and grizzled travel veteran at age 26 , he practically met and forgot other humans for a living . on the other hand , her huge personality glowed when she opened her mouth and bared her perfectly gaptoothed smile . newline newline tommy s mind drifted through a disorganized memory of fuzzy professional encounters until he found himself , 13 , enjoying a summer day in his parents  backyard . in the middle of a dry patch , sprinklers slowly saturated the soil and tommy recalled the nowforeign bliss of running through the jets of water keeping the grass green . as the only 7th grader on his block , and puberty s hormones raging , tommy s best friend was a long and slender blonde named andrea . if andrea was real , 7thgradetommy was convinced they d be happily married by 26 . but here he was , alone waiting for his plane to board . newline newline  at least i m in first class ,  he thought . upgrades were the one thing about flying he could enjoy anymore . with 10 minutes until boarding , he grabbed a book to pass the time . newline newline sitting across from him in the boarding area , dayna only noticed the quaffedhaired gentleman when he retrieved the coverless hardback from his briefcase . an avid reader with a cat s curiosity , found herself annoyed when she could nt see the book s title on the bridge . she took the covers off of her hardbacks to preserve them , too , but in the moment she was possessed to find out what he was reading . you could nt call dayna shy . newline newline  excuse me ,  called a familiar voice .  i need a new book  is that one any good ?  newline newline her hair was different , short and tousled while andrea s was longer and straight , but her confidence and intonation struck him immediately . peering over the pages , his usual anxieties were washed away and he felt at home . newline newline  depends on what you like .  tommy flashed a smile . he was nt exactly reading pulitzer literature , enjoying the last chapter of a merlin series targeted to an adolescent crowd by t.a . barron .  if you re into welsh mythology ...  newline newline  what s it called ?  newline newline  the wings of merlin . just rereading a childhood favorite !  newline newline dayna remembered those books , though she guessed she was one of a handful of young women to read any young adult fantasy books growing up . without anyone to talk to about the stories , she just talked about them with merlin himself . well , dayna s version of merlin was a rebel with a jean vest and tattoos . it started with an imaginary book club and grew into a  healthy  friendship . reminiscing at the same time she was holding a conversation , a smile turned into a laugh . newline newline  i actually loved that series as a kid !  newline newline her smile really threw tommy for a loop . it was unmistakably andrea s , crooked teeth and all . this airport stranger was a grownup version of a childhood phantom . always suspicious of psychosis , he had to make sure this was nt actually andrea manifesting herself . newline newline  i do nt know if i ve met anyone else who has . i m tommy , and you are ?  newline newline extending an introductory hand , dayna was happy to finally talk to someone in real life about her favorite childhood fantasy series .  i m dayna . i ca nt believe you re reading that ! it s been years since i picked them up , but i never had anyone to share them with .  newline newline relieved she was nt a hallucination , but sure this was some  moment  the universe wanted him to have , tommy dove into conversation . his favorite part about the series was really young merlin s relationship with the doeeyed hallia . and that doeeyed girl was all dayna s imaginary merlin would ever talk about , which makes sense for a teenage boy in love for the first time . newline newline  you know , you kind of remind me of someone .  her cheeks flushed a bit as she admitted it .  you remind me of the imaginary merlin i talked to as a kid ! he d never shut up about hallia , and you look just like him too .  newline newline  how bizarre ! there were nt any other kids my age around when i was growing up . my imaginary friend went by andrea and you re just a grown up version of her , right down to the way you talk .  newline newline the gate agent s voice came over the pa , cutting off their conversation .  we ll now begin boarding flight 3549 , with service to seattle . please board now if you need extra time or assistance .  newline newline a bit upset that the universe was cutting his moment short , tommy was nt ready to let this one pass him by . as he put the book away , he asked  hey , is seattle home for you ? i m going to go get a snack for the flight , but i d love to connect with you again .  newline newline  i m actually flying out to look at apartments . i ll be moving out there in a few months . maybe i ll be next to you on the flight and you can tell me all about the neighborhoods . i m in 2b .  newline newline the universe smiled . tommy was in 2a .  guess we got lucky , i m in 2a . i ll see you on the plane ! logan slammed the bottle down on the table . the sound of glass banging onto the hardwood rattled through the living room . he stared up at the wall full of old family photos that sat above the fireplace . he stood up walked over to the frame his father  s boot camp graduation picture was in and scanned over his passive stare into the distance and pristine military uniform . newline newline  god dammit.  he said to himself .  when i need you most , you  re not here for me . you were never fucking there . but i won  t give up on him like you did me.  newline newline pacing back and forth around his living room his eyes fixed to the family picture set up on the mantle piece . he walked over to it and grasped the small wooden frame tight . the happy faces of his wife and son stared back at him . newline newline  fuck you , bitch !  he cried out . he threw the frame against the wall . glass shattered as the small wooden frame snapped in half before tumbling to the ground . shards of glass coated the hardwood in front of him . newline newline  i can  t believe she did this . how could she ? how could she just take my boy away from me like that ? i don  t get it.  he said . newline newline he took a seat on the chair next to the hardwood coffee table and grabbed the bottle , immediately taking another swig of the hard brown liquor . with the bottle still in hand he pulled out his phone and pushed the small telephone shaped icon next to  the wife  in his call log . the phone rang twice before he was sent to voicemail . he hung up and tried again , this time being sent to voicemail before the first ring could even finish . newline newline  i can  t fucking believe this is happening.  he said , putting his hands into his palms .  why ? just tell me what i did !  tears started rolling down logan  s cheeks . he went over to the smashed frame , glass crunching beneath his boots . he picked up the picture from the scattered remains and stroked his sons face with his thumb . newline newline  i  ll never give up.  he whispered . newline newline he started tearing his wife  s body out of the picture . leaving only his son and himself in front of pearly white sands and crystal blue water . he took the torn , bare picture and stuck it back on the mantle , throwing the half with his wife on it on the ground . newline newline he took another swig from the half empty bottle and sat down . newline newline  i  ll never leave him like you did me , dad . you piece of shit.  he said looking up to the ceiling and laying his head back onto the rest . newline newline he reached back into his pocket and pulled his phone out . he scrolled through contacts until he stopped at  dave  . he clicked the contact and met the heavy beard and thick glasses his father wore in the top left corner and his phone number directly below it . he stared at the contact box and hovered his finger over the small telephone shaped icon . newline newline  you  ve been gone over a year and i still can  t forgive you ,  he said , tapping the small icon . the number had been disconnected for months . awaiting a dial tone , logan didn  t even bother putting the phone to his ear . the sound of the phone ringing back at him pierced the air like a knife . his hand began to shake as he hesitantly lifted the phone up to his ear . after two rings it stopped . the white noise coming from the other end of the phone sent shivers down his spine . newline newline  hello ?  logan said . the white noise was becoming deafening . newline newline  if this is some kind of joke , it isn  t a fucking good one . this was my fath  newline newline  hello ?  the unmistakably deep resonance from his father  s voice interrupted . newline newline  dad ? but..no..it can  t be.  logan said .  i buried you.  newline newline  hello ?  the voice responded . newline newline  look , i don  t know who the fuck you are , but this shit isn  t funny . why do you have my father  s phone ?  logan said . newline newline  hello ?  the voice responded , deeper , and more hoarse than the last one . newline newline  i  m not playing this fucking game with you.  logan said sternly . newline newline  hello ? ,  the voice said . it  s pitch becoming lower and lower , almost grumbling . its voice was distorting , like two were speaking at once . newline newline  i  m hanging up . i  m not doing this shit with you . your voice changer isn  t fucking scary.  logan said . logan  s defiance was met with deep curdling laughs from the other end of the phone . newline newline  we  ll see you tonight.  the voices said . newline newline edit : readability .i waved goodbye to the cab driver and walked up the front steps , my briefcase hitting my knees in pounding defeat . newline newline what a day . i always worked long hours , but the past couple months had been 14hour days that left me dead exhausted . newline newline the only excitement i felt was to see my wife and hear about her day . she had this real melodic voice , ya know , and no matter what she talked about it lifted my mood a bit . i know she d had book club that morning , a regular doctor s checkup that afternoon . i wanted to hear every detail . newline newline i opened the door and called her name . no response . her shoes were nt flung under the table in the foyer , and her coat was nt on the hook , so i texted her . newline newline hey , where are you ?  newline newline her response popped up only moments later . newline newline at home , where are you ?  newline newline i waited before replying . i reread her message , wandered up and down the hallway , checked for her car in the garage . no sign of her . newline newline also at home . no really , silly , where are you ?  newline newline the response was just as fast this time . newline newline that s your home . i m at mine . sorry it has to be this way .  newline newline i dropped my phone in shock and the screen cracked in the lower left corner . damn . newline newline i replied again a few times , really but her response was nt so fast anymore . instead of three seconds , it took three and a half years for her to answer . and that was to invite me to my daughter s third birthday party .the wind whistled through my three hundred dollar haircut as i stretched on the balcony . that bitch had torn down the curtains as she fell , but i could hardly care less . five hundred dollars in damages , maybe six hundred if i m rude . completely dwarfed by two hundred thousand dollars of insurance money . sure , maybe the government would take some , as they always do . maybe they d force me to allocate some of it to my kid s college savings . but before all that could happen , it would mysteriously vanish into an offshore bank account , and mister howard cross would cease to exist . sucks for the kid , but hey , it s a rabbit eat rabbit world out there . newline newline a knock on the door . i vaguely recalled having some wine sent up . i stretched , sauntered across the hotel room , and opened the door . i d have to file a complaint to management about how loud the service knocks around here . it s late . newline newline my wife walks in .  well that was rude .  newline newline what . the . fuck ? i give her the blankest stare imaginable .  that was a twenty story drop into heavy traffic .  newline newline she rolls her eyes .  yeah . is the wine here yet ? i need a drink after that . oh , and next time you do nt want to go somewhere because you re too tired  , do nt .  newline newline  i dont  newline newline  falling twenty floors means i have to climb twenty floors , dummy . bled all over my nice dress , too .  she fished part of a torn curtain out of the coach bag i bought her .  how much do you think they ll make us pay for this ?  newline newline  i dunno , five hundred bucks , maybe six hundr  newline newline a rap on the door .  room service !  newline newline my wife turns to answer it , muttering praise the lord  under her breath . there was the failsafe . the gun i kept under the pillow . i silently crept over . newline newline  ooh , how much did this cabernet cost ?  newline newline  about a hundred and fifty bucks .  i say as i pull the trigger . a clean shot through the head . excellent marksmanship , even by my standards , and i m hardly an amateur . as she fell , i even managed to catch the bottle . newline newline  now what did you do that for ?  i almost drop the bottle as fragments of skull and ribbons of flesh fly across the room , reforming into the top of my wife s head . newline newline  dear god , what are you ? and why are nt you fighting back ?  newline newline  oh honey , i ve known you wanted to kill me from the beginning . i m just so glad you finally took the initiative , went out , and did it ! chase your dreams . i mean , you re not the first to try .  newline newline  are you going to call the police ?  newline newline  too much paperwork .  newline newline  so why stay with me ? does nt it hurt ?  newline newline  a little , yeah . but you get used to it . it s more of an empty feeling really . like the top of your head just ... is nt there . but if it makes you happy . cuz being with you makes me happy too .  newline newline  wow . i m ... sorry .  newline newline  do nt be . i ll blink and you ll be gone . just like the others . for now , just let me enjoy a night drinking with a handsome young man . and you can kill me again after if you really want .  newline newline  i think i m good , thanks . after a moment of fear , knowing that you may be on your death bed , you decide to respond . newline newline  what book is it ?  you whisper . newline newline  a tale of time ,  death responds .  really you mus nt worry , it is a long book . and sometimes i do nt finish in one sitting .  newline newline  why are you here ?  you whisper again . newline newline  why , i m waiting on you of course , or i guess you re waiting on me , not sure which way that goes . but i ve been eager to make your acquaintance .  newline newline  why ? what have i done ?  you cough out . your cough only seems to be getting stronger . newline newline  it is nt what you have done so much as it is what i expect you will do . you see , when old people die and greet me , they are ready . they come to me tired of life , ready to rest . what am i to do with them ? they are useless to me . but young people . children . you have yet to live . i am eager to see what we can accomplish together .  death looks back down to his book .  now where was i ?  he mutters . newline newline you pause for a moment to think . if you let him finish that book , you re done for . newline newline  why are you reading that book ?  you ask .  what is it about ?  newline newline  i have nt gotten very far ,  he responds , slightly annoyed ,  but it is about the flow of life , how it only moves in one direction , and always seems to achieve more as time goes on . i quite like it . i still have a lot to learn about you humans .  he smiles at you briefly and then looks back down at the book . newline newline  huh ,  you are interrupted by a coughing fit .  huh ,  you continue ,  that sounds quite informative . i ve never heard of it . do you have a spare copy ? i have been terribly bored .  newline newline  why do you want to read this ?  he asks .  you are a young boy . are you not interested in dragons and tales of heroism ?  newline newline  actually , no , i am not .  newline newline you roll over to the other side of the bed by your nightstand . you pick up a book of reasonable size . newline newline  this is the last book i read . it is about a man i admire . he grew up as a farm boy and moved into a huge city and became one of the greatest businessmen of his time . he died old and happy . he gave life all that he could . would you like to see it ?  newline newline you wait in eager anticipation as he thinks for a moment . you shuffle your body up the best that you can so that you are leaning against the headboard . you hold the book out towards him . newline newline  i suppose ,  he pauses .  i suppose i could give it a quick look . i ve never read of business before . you are only 13 are you not , boy ?  newline newline  yes i am.  you reply . newline newline  interesting . well , as i said , i am in no rush . i will read this book and then my own , if you would let me . is that alright ?  newline newline  yes.  you reply . newline newline he glances at the cover , scans through the back , and then pops it open to begin . newline newline you prepare yourself for a nap , supposing your body will let you . you shut your eyes and drift off . newline  newline hours later you wake up and glance over to see that death has already put down your book and continued his own . newline newline  what did you think ?  you whisper . newline newline  ah you are awake . well , i agree , he was an interesting man . in fact , i think i might remember him . he may govern a district of the underworld.  newline newline  govern ?  you ask .  but you said that old people are useless.  newline newline  well ,  he says as if he is pondering something .  yes , it is more of a general rule than it is a fact.  newline newline  do you think he would have been as much value to you if you took him earlier in life ?  you ask . newline newline  i am not sure , generally , the younger i find you , the more we accomplish.  newline newline  it sounds like you are not taking this on a case by case basis.  you retort .  i don  t think that is particularly fair . and i know you never said it was fair . but ,  you pause to gather direction .  he was a businessman after all correct ?  newline newline  yes , that is clear.  newline newline  so perhaps he was more useful to you based off of what he learned during life . he learned to never generalize your audience , he learned to specifically target a defined audience , and to take things on a case by case basis . never judge things so black and white.  newline newline  yes i suppose that could be why he has been so effective.  death replies . newline newline  in that case , i ask that you would leave me be , and let me recover . you can count on me bringing all that i have learned in life , and applying it all down below.  newline newline  well , i suppose i can finish my book another time . i do appreciate the talk boy.  newline newline death rises from his seat , grabs his scythe , and fades away , leaving his copy of the book behind . newline newline  you hold onto that book for me.  you hear from an erie , distant voice . a few years before i was born , the first baby which the date of death was inked onto the back of her neck entered the world ignorant of the fact that she was going to die a few hours later . the nurses did their best to save her , but godwilling , that little girl drowned in her own blood . all children born after had their death date  signed on the back of their neck , in tarblack ink . newline newline  these death dates ca nt be removed , but they can be covered up , which most parents opted to do to avoid their children afflicted daily by an existential crisis . a skin colored tattoo over the date was all that was needed to live a fulfilling life where death is unexpected and tragic . it became as common as circumcision once was , and life went on normally . newline newline  i resented my parents for not covering my death date up . they believed in the new inkless  movement , where kids were forced to struggle with thoughts of death everyday . the inkless  movement believed that this struggle helped you become a better person that would lead a more fulfilling life . the trend was catching on in southern california , and specifically in the hippie community . my parents were were hippies  they smoked pot , dropped acid , were frequently naked , listened to music that made them feel young again , even though they sagged in all sorts of places . and the most telling sign that they were hippies , to me at least : they were terrible fucking parents . newline newline  i think my upbringing contributed to my depression , which was the reason i found myself holding this revolver in my hand . there were six chambers , but only three bullets . my death date was sixty years from now , presumably after a life of drinking and disappointment . i couldntthe imagine it any way else . as i spun the cylinder , i wondered if i could expedite the process . fiftyfifty , and a winwin at that . who would nt play ? newline newline  i spun once . newline newline click . newline newline  i spun again . newline newline click newline newline  i spun ten more times , and ten clicks followed . i m not a math whiz , but the chance of that happening is less than one percent . maybe i was just lucky . newline newline  so i popped in three more bullets which landed into their sockets with a small clink . i snapped the cylinder back into place and raised the revolver calmly to my head . what s the difference between sixty years later and the present ? not much , i thought . death comes to all of us , right ? newline newline  i pull the trigger . newline newline click . newline newline  the gun jammed .  newline newline  that s amazing !  exclaimed my grandson .  what happened next ?  newline newline  well happily , i got over my depression soon after , and i did nt try to kill myself again ,  i said .  but i did become the world s richest russian roulette player .  newline newline  so those crazy stories mom told me about you and the brazilians are true !  newline newline  they re all true ,  i said , smiling with a glint of pride .  they re all true . a bunch of people from my university were hosting a small party , and i was the life of it . i m talking cartwheeling  do nt judge me , it s the only party trick i have !  , shitty dancing , very loud and offkey singing . about five shots into the night , i spotted a discarded set of cards against humanity and drunk me had a fantastic idea . i was low on cash , and here was a group of people with uncertain futures and huge amounts of debt , who were also looking for some fun . newline newline  who wants to know what their future holds ?  i called to the people gathered around the table , while i grabbed the blanket from the sofa and fashioned a lopsided turban out of it .  i can tell you if you ll pass that big test next week ! or maybe if your crush likelikes you ? everything you wan na know is right here , in these cards , and i will tell you for the low , very appropriate price of one dollar !  newline newline newline you see , my mom used to question the cards ever so often when she did nt have luck in love , and she also had a very long infatuation with one of the hosts on the astrochannel . so a lot of my childhood was spent playing with my gameboy on the floor of the living room while my mother watched sad old housewives call in to a tv show to have their futures read and their bank accounts emptied . newline newline i learned three things from that : newline newline 1 . never ever give a questionable tv channel your credit card information newline 2 . there s a lot of people out there whose love lives suck so badly that they re willing to do pretty much everything to get a little bit of hope . newline 3 . how to do a basic three card spread . newline newline one thing i did nt learn from that was how to hold my liquor , which is , of course , how this whole ridiculous situation started . newline newline i spent the next half hour bullshitting my way through all kinds of questions , from how can i get through the big chem exam without failing   the answer was : my high tech collection of sex toys  to how can i get my crush to notice me ?   a white guy named jamal  . newline newline shortly after , the alcohol caught up with me and i passed out somewhere between the couch and the bathroom . the next morning , i had ten dollars more in my pocket and a headache the size of eurasia . newline newline i forgot about my tarot against humanity side business pretty much instantly and waded back into wrangling the sea of essays that i needed to turn in during the next couple of weeks . it was nt until about a month or so later that i realised something was definitely weird around me . newline newline people were starting to look at me weird . newline newline three days later i found my way to the chem final blocked by a buzzing wall of shiny silver vibrators . a skinny asian guy had apparently tried to twister his way through it , but found out the hard way that it filled pretty much the entire hallway . he was very obviously stuck . and one of the sharp , very futuristic looking things had pushed its way somewhere it really should nt have gone without lube and the poor dude was crying with every buzz . newline newline when he saw that i was watching he first mumbled something and then called out to the other onlookers .  this is his doing ! everything has been going wrong ever since the party ! all the printers one the campus have spat out nothing but harry potter erotica since he pulled that card for eliza . the miller twins had to be separated because they kept performing unwilling incest on each other and they did nt stop until one of them had crossed state lines !  newline newline frantically he struggled in his cage made of sex toys and i swallowed at the accusation . dread settled low in my stomach . this could nt be true , it was absolutely impossible . newline newline the people around me stepped as far away from me as they could get . newline newline defensively , i looked around , but there was no support for me . i crossed my arms and frowned .  you ca nt seriously believe that this is some kind of magic card trick people , can you ? how crazy are you all ?  newline newline  he s right though . every card you pulled that night has become true .  newline newline i went through my spotty memories of that night . in front of me the sex toys . and i d heard something about a jamal singing a love song in front of the gym the other day . and i guess there was that day where everybody for some godforsaken reason woke up wearing assless chaps . newline newline  there s one thing that did nt happen ,  i said triumphant ,  my asshole is just fine . no bleaching at all !  newline newline but the second i finished that sentence i felt a burn spreading out from the general direction of my bum . it was terrible . in horror i closed my eyes and tried newline to pretend i was nt in the middle of the most humiliating thing that had ever happened . but then i heard the voice of my mom from somewhere close and i remembered : the first card that i had pulled was an oedipus complex  . newline newlinemarcus awoke in a state of confusion . his mouth was dry as a desert , and it would seem as though the light leaking in through his curtains had spilled onto his face during the night , giving half of his face a slightly redder hue . slowly , marcus edged his feet off the side of his bed and onto the floor . standing up and walking across his modestly furnished room , marcus slowly leaned himself down into his desk chair . flipping the switch to his computer , the room was filled with the light hum of fans and the glow of light from 3 connected monitors . the computer was up and running in no time flat , and marcus immediately opened up his browser . he was met with an unfamiliar screen informing him he had no connection . odd ...  thought marcus , this was a screen he was not familiar with . google fiber had come to marcus s town a few months ago , and since then he had enjoyed his high speed internet with no issue . not to worry marcus thought to himself , i can fix this no trouble . newline newline without realizing it , the phone was already in his hands and ringing . after a moment a click was heard through the speaker , someone on the other end had picked up , their room was full of noise . newline newline  thank you for calling comcast support , my name is maria , how can i help you today ?  newline newlineascendant . newline newline all i ever wanted was control . it  s all anyone really wants , at the end of the day . people phrase it differently , but control is what they are after . they want the power to enforce their will , and to defend themselves from those doing the same . they want money to buy off other people . they might even want a titled role to allow them to enforce their will . newline newline i wasn  t satisfied with any of that in the end at least . i started peacefully enough i suppose . i just wanted to be able to walk , to overcome the limits that my pitiful mortal frame placed upon me . the malformed limbs that couldn  t carry a peach , much less the rest of my body , had been my shackles and my driving force . newline newline these pitiful limbs forced me to learn . i was forced to reach for true power . power over the universe itself was the only solution i was willing to accept , the power to heal myself or to simply work around the useless limbs i was born with . i figured that out when i was eight . i mastered a simple levitation spell , and then began to build on it . i would carry myself in a grid of telekinetic force , and i would use my magic in place of my hands . newline newline but when i learned that i was so used to reaching for more power . more magic . more control . so i kept going . newline newline death life sickness health i kept studying . kept learning . kept fixing . i learned to give motion to the dead , and to build a wall between those i cared about and death . fire , frost , and lighting danced to my tune , and my power continued to grow . newline newline i was opposed eventually , of course . nobles , priests , and those misguided  heroes  they sent against me all tried to stop me . to reign me in , or to kill me . they feared my growing power , although i held no malice towards them until they struck first . newline newline i kept growing though . kept learning . kept experimenting . newline newline now now i am about to end it all . i am going to end this neverending series of experiments and growth . today i take my place among the immortals . i don  t know what will happen after the ritual ends after i dive into the well of souls itself and use its power to reshape myself into something more . newline newline but i know this much there will be opposition to my success . i must prepare myself for the inevitable interruptions , and do whatever it takes . i shall be a god soon .this is my first time writing in a long time , so bear with me , i hope it is good . while writing i noticed that my tenses are off in some parts , but i am just doing a quick write up , and do nt really feel like proof reading it . newline newline chris knew that he had to do something to help moe . they had been best friends through thick and thin since grade school . girls had come and gone for each of them , but this one really had moe torn up . three and a half years together , and lindsey just threw it all away in one stupid night . moe is nt an angry man , or a vengeful man . he never once yelled or got angry . he is very kind , emotional , and forgiving , and chris knew that he tried his damndest to make it work . but in the end moe could nt live with himself allowing the relationship to continue . he never stopped loving her , and still does to this day . but he was no longer in love with her , and that is what hurt the most . he was hurt , betrayed , and knew that no matter what he did , he would never be able to get the images out of his head of the love of his life laying with another . newline newline moe had nt left his apartment thursday  the day he finally put an end to the relationship that resulted in the happiest times of his life . chris wanted to give him the time and space he knew was needed , but he also knew that he was the only one that was going to be able to bring moe out of this rut . chris was invited to party at a coworker s house , and saw this as a perfect opportunity to try and get moe back into the real world . newline newline that afternoon , chris stopped by moe s apartment unannounced . he knocked on the door to no response . he yelled through the door to announce his presence , hoping that moe would be relieved to hear a familiar voice . moe simply told him to go away . chris knew better than to be discouraged by that , and having the spare key , decided to let himself in anyway . he found moe laying on the couch in his underwear , and judging by the smell , he had been there for a while . chris immediately started ordering moe to get ready for the night .  take a shower , get dressed , and comb your hair ,  he demanded .  i m taking you to lunch , and we are going out tonight .  moe refused .  dude , you have to leave your apartment some time . remember that guy dave i work with ? he is having a party tonight , and we re going . i told him that i m bringing you , and he is super excited for you to be there . there will be people to meet , beers to drink , and weed to be smoked .  moe refused .  at least clean yourself up and let me take you to lunch . i m sure you need to eat something , and we can talk about it there .  moe finally agreed . newline newline the guys went to the corner pub and ordered up some burgers and a bucket of beer . neither of them brought up lindsey or anything to do with moe s current bit of depression . after throwing back a few coors , it was like old times . the guys talked sports , video games , movies ... chris could tell that moe was lightening up . he finally asked moe if he would go to the party with him , and moe accepted he invitation . a short walk to the liquor store , and another couple blocks later , and the guys were at dave s . they walk in the door , case of beer and fifth of whiskey in hand , and the party is already in full swing . they make their way through the crowd . moe recognizes a few people , which is inevitable at a party in a small town like this . they finally make it to the kitchen and find dave talking to some guests . chris makes eye contact with him and the conversation is immediately broken so the host can greet his new guests . newline newline the three of them exchange greetings , and dave introduces the guys to his other friends . the group chats for a while and does a couple of shots , then they disperse to mingle with others at the party . chris and moe move to the basement , where they see a few more of chris s coworkers . chris notices that one of the girls , abby , is clearly flirting with moe . chris does his best to try and gauge moe s interest and see if he can pair them up , but moe clearly is nt ready for anything like that yet . they separate , and the guys move to the other room in the basement , and moe is stopped dead in his tracks . he looks to the couch and sees an out of place lindsey , sitting uncomfortably , red cup in hand , while a few of her friends talk . she looks up . they make eye contact . their hearts skip a beat .it started as a normal day at the bank . i was dropping off a check from my accounting job and i was in line behind a big guy who i d struck up a conversation about the wildly fluctuating weather with . i d just mentioned the crazy wind and how things had taken a turn for the worse when a couple people in balaclavas and big winter coats came in .  see , case in point . in a couple days , they ll be putting those away and wearing tshirts again .  newline newline in terms of last words before the shit hit the fan , those are pretty stupidsounding . newline newline the guns came out then , shiny metal with murderous intent . suddenly i felt naked and afraid . right after that , i realized i probably was nt going to get to the library for a while . my mind handles crises in strange ways , apparently . newline newline they overpowered the old portly security guard in moments as i stood and watched in shock . unfortunately , the guard seemed to be years past the time when he was in good enough condition to provide security . so that left the rest of us . the big guy i was talking to had ducked behind a desk . the drive through teller still did nt know what was going on but the other tellers had dropped down below their desks and the other customers were shrinking away from the sudden outbreak of violence . newline newline damn . that made me the closest person to them , and probably the next one they would approach . fortunately for me , ever since elementary school , i had a way of dealing with people who seemed likely to hurt me . i stared at up into one corner of the ceiling and nudged my awareness into my nose , willing the blood vessels to open . i felt the pressure build in my nose and then release . newline newline i cringed , collapsed to the ground , holding my head in both hands .  damn tumor ,  i stagegrumbled .  sorry , give me a minute ,  i said , taking one hand off my head and holding the palm towards them , fingers up . the other hand slid around from the side of my head to my forehead . i appeared to struggle through a spike of pain before regaining composure , and i felt the warm damp stickiness of blood tracing down my lip , the coppery taste as it ran into my mouth .  right . i guess i m ...  i winced again .  i ll talk . i do nt have all that long to live anyway .  newline newline the bank robbers , because that s what my brain realized they were , seemed to soften slightly .  hey , no worries , man , we just want the money . do nt get me wrong , we will totally kill anybody that tries anything , but we do nt wan na have to kill anybody ,  one of them said . newline newline  thanks ,  i said weakly .  just take the money and do nt shoot anybody .  i hoped that had given the top bank person enough time to get the police involved and get done . newline newline after a few minutes of the robbers moving things around , i saw the police cars with the lights on coming up the street . i waved the rest of the people in the building to get out . they bolted and i stayed . it would nt have been consistent with the character i d developed . besides , usually with these sorts of things the negotiators wanted to get a hostage for the bank robbers  demands . newline newline with my ability to bleed at will , i played it off as being stressed and the stress aggravating the tumor . they softened up and sent me out and that broke the impasse . i even made it to the library . newline newline all in all , not a bad afternoon .one newline newline the orc platoon was moving quickly , spreading out as they staggered behind the knight at closer and closer ranges . newline the panting knight s vision remained fixated ahead , inferring the growing danger from their footsteps , twigs snapping underfoot , and the guttural grunts and roars which seemed to almost wet his neck with their slobbering howls . the princess in his arms squealed with terror as one hurled a hand axe which the shinning man ducked under at the last second .  enough is enough  he thought , as they entered a sunbathed clearing , in a moment he placed the maiden at the foot of a royal oak and spun around to face the beasts . he counted five orcs and chuckled briefly at the one who he now saw had an arrow comically sticking out of an eye socket . the battle lasted seconds , with a glint of light the knight drew his silver sword and sliced three of the orcs with a seemingly single blow that left their bodies to freeze upright then slide in half lazily revealing the perfect cut made through their waists . newline newline  god i love that .  he muttered . newline newline then in a second streak , he swung the sword in a twisting arc which took the sword and attached arm of an advancing orc , finally throwing the blade like a javelin straight through the last green face s open maw . newline after retrieving the blade he walked back to the tree where the beautiful woman in silk leapt to her feet . newline newline  my hero ! you have saved me from the horde , now come ! live with me as royalty in the castle !  newline removing his visor the knight looked up to see two flashing prompts above the fair maiden s face newline newline  kiss princess    confront  newline newline as the knight cocked his head for the kiss and the screen narrowed to a letterbox jonathan snapped the gaming device shut , and tossed it on the couch . newline newline he already knew what came next , he thought as he stood up , walked to the kitchen , and opened the pantry . he had kissed the princess so he would now have to escort her for a few more levels back to the castle , wherein he would be accepted as royalty but would soon have his morals tested as he learned of the bloody acts the dictatorship took to keep their power . eventually being forced by the game to kill the mad king . newline newline he grabbed a ceramic bowl from the top shelf and a box of krispy krunch  from the lowest . newline newline it was not despite this plot knowledge that he had kissed the princess but because of it  for if he had confronted her with his knowledge of the murderous dictatorship he would then have to fight a quicktimeinduced battle with her to avoid being stabbed , a fight which could only end in her death and his attacking the castle not from within the royal family but from outside the gates and through the creation of a people s rebellion . newline newline a bit of the cereal missed the bowl and scattered along the countertop . newline newline  choice is funny that way  jonathan mused as he splashed milk over the pile of yellow flakes ,  sometimes it s just a pretty way of getting to the same ending .  newline newline and that was when the doorbell rang . newline newline newline newlinei could nt believe it when i heard the news . my roommate was dead ! i hate to say it , but it was an answered prayer for me . he was such an ass . it was nt just that he would leave his empty soda cans lying everywhere , the table , the floor , even the sink for some reason , or the crumbs that he left sprayed over the ground . it was nt his whining , nasal voice . no . it was his smug , selfcentered attitude . nothing was ever his fault . the mess was always  someone else .  any conversation , on any topic , and magically he became an expert . and god forbid if you dared to disagree . he d go on and on in that whining drone of his , not shutting up until you just gave up and let him keep his stupid , selfabsorbed opinions . newline newline god , i hate him so , so much . and , unlike my other roommates i was stupid enough to engage . to call him out on his selfpity fest when he bitched and moaned about how horrible we all were , about how much respect he deserved , slaving away cleaning up after us . that was when i snapped . newline newline we had words , and he left , presumably to find one of his idiot friends to complain about me . i did nt care . for once there was peace and quiet . we started to wonder after he had nt returned by the next day . but honestly , we just did not care enough to try and figure out where he was . newline newline that is , until the police came . they told us the news . he had been found dead in an alleyway near our house , a bullet in his head . someone had clumsily tried to make it look like suicide , but there were other fingerprints on the gun , and it was in his right hand although normally he used his left . newline newline i did nt care . he was out of our lives . thank god . unfortunately for me , i had made no secret of how much i had hated him , and the police politely asked me to accompany them to the station . i did nt blame them . i was naturally the first suspect . my other roommates would back me up . i would be fine . newline newline i may have , hah , jumped the gun on that one . once in the station , they took my fingerprints and a dna sample . while i waited in the dingy , poorly lit interview room , they compared the fingerprints to those they had found on the gun . they were a perfect match . newline newline after they had read me my rights , my lawyer came to speak with me .  son ,  he said , after polishing his glasses on his too shiny suit ,  i m not going to lie to you . it looks bad . maybe it d be better if you just confessed . crime of passion , you were in a heated argument , you followed him , got into another argument . he pulled out the gun , you two struggled , he got shot . you panicked , put the gun in his hand and ran . tell that to a judge , and with any luck you ll only have to do a few years . hell , keep your nose clean and you ll get out even sooner .  newline newline  no .  my voice was a hoarse whisper . after they had charged me , i had screamed obscenities and curses at the policemen . i felt bad about that now . they were just doing their jobs . i took a swig of water , and said it again .  no . i did nt kill him . i m innocent , and i want to prove it .  the lawyer shook his head and sighed . newline newline  alright . but you know what that means , right ?  newline newline my skin crawled .  reanimation .  we could bring back the dead , to testify at their trials . the did nt last long , the technology was imperfect , but the verdict often hinged on their testimony . after all , who would know the murderer better than the victim ? newline newline  that s right . reanimation . and son , if you re telling the truth  newline newline  i am .  newline newline  whatever . it does nt matter . if you re telling the truth , that does nt mean he ll see it that way . a brief struggle in the dark , he did nt see the other guy s face ... well , twenty four hours is nt a lot of time on this earth , and the dead want vengeance . if he ca nt say who did it , he might blame you outta spite . after all , he left because of your argument .  newline newline that sounded exactly like something he would do . but what choice did i have ? newline newline the trial day came , and i dressed in my sunday finest . i sat there in the courtroom as the technicians set up the chair . wires looped around the arms and legs , and an electrical crown hung above it . that was what they were going to use to shock the brain back into working . once the technicians were done , the morticians wheeled out the corpse . newline newline he had nt been a looker , and death was no improvement . suspended as he was in the reanimation fluid , his face had a sickly pallor and his eyes were cloudy and dim . they heaved the body out , death apparently had not made him any less heavy , and squeezed him into the chair . electrodes were attached , and then they began the process . newline newline at first , nothing seemed to happen . it just sat there as they gave ever increasing shocks . but then , slowly , it began to twitch . a hand jerked from side to side . his head lolled sickeningly on its neck . his eyelids began to flutter . and then ... then he woke up . newline newline for a corpse , he seemed surprisingly aware . he smacked his lips a few times and looked around the courtroom with more curiosity than surprise . the judge turned to him .  do you know where you are ?  newline newline he smiled , his teeth brown and loose in his mouth .  yesh , your honor .  death had thickened and slurred his voice , but it still had that whinging , nasally quality . newline newline  very well . we will now hear your testimony on your murderer . but first , can you see him in this room ?  they dead man slowly twisted his neck , scanning the room . it stopped abruptly when he saw me . newline newline  yesh .  that little , cocksucking bastard . i already knew how this was going to go . newline newline  very well . describe the events leading up to your murder .  newline newline  it wash in the evening . i had argued with my roommate .  he waved a sickly , mottled hand in my direction .  he wash always complaining . i did all the work around the apartment , and did he ever thank me ? nooo , it was always my fault somehow . anyway , i left to go on a walk . let him clear hish head , sho he could apologi  for the way he treated me .  newline newline the judge began nodding sympathetically . shit . newline newline  anyway , i wash shtrolling along , when shuddenly i heard footshteps behind me . i turned around , and there he wash , holding a gun . i begged him not to do it but he laughed . he shaid that he had shpent months turning the other roommates against me , leaving garbage lying around and blaming it on me , undercutting me whenever i gave advice . he laughed and shaid that no one would care that i had died . then he shot me .  newline newline i heard gasps and muffled conversation in the court behind me . i caught the word monster , and clenched my fists . even from beyond the grave , this man was such a bastard . newline newline  why would he do all this ?  the judge asked , pity dripping from every word . newline newline  he musht be cray , your honor . i ca nt think of another reashon . i always treated him nicely .  newline newline he looked me dead in the eyes then , and winked . that was when i knew . the little piece of shit in front of me had set up the whole thing . it was a suicide . i do nt know how he got the fingerprints on the gun , but at this point it did nt really matter , did it ? he was smarter than i had realized . i was going down . newline newline the knowledge calmed me , oddly enough . there was nothing i could do . nothing i could say . well , except for one thing . newline newline i stood up .  your honor , if i could testify ?  newline newline the judge looked at me with venom in his eyes , and then turned to the corpse in the witness stand .  have you finished your testimony ?  newline newline  i have , your honor .  newline newline the judge waved a languid hand .  very well , testify if you must .  my roommate s body stood up , and started lurching towards the chair they had so thoughtfully put out for him , and the prosecutions table . as i walked towards the witness stand , he seemed to stumble , and fell towards me . as he passed by me , he muttered  gotcha .  i smiled , widely and , halted my slow stride towards the witness stand . i knew that he would nt resist the chance to gloat . and now ? now he was in arms reach . newline newline i kicked his kneecap . the dead can still feel pain . as he screamed and fell , i lept on top of him , hitting and hitting , pulverizing that smug , arrogant bastard s face . by the time they dragged me off of him , there was nothing left but fragments of bone and rotten meat . i laughed as the pulled me out of the courtroom and into the waiting police car . newline newline after all , if i was going down for his murder , should nt i at least have the satisfaction of killing him ? newline newline edit : grammar , spellingbefore i get into the criticism part let me say this . the story is intriguing and engaging . i like the character , i like his fear , his actions , his mild insanity about his life and guilt . i like his reflections on himself . overall , i like the theme and concept . newline newline newline i bolded words that you could better find the notations , but ther is nothing special about the words themselves , just place markers . newline newline newline  raymond was running through the forest away from the town . 1 he knew the guards would be looking for him . he could nt believe how stupid he had been . 2 he heard the guards yelling behind him , trying to find where he was . raymond found a considerably large tree with a split in the trunk . the tree had been hollowed out at its base , probably by an animal or something . 3 he wedged himself inside , shut his eyes , and prayed the4 would nt find him . he could barely breath , he was feeling claustrophobic5 , he could nt be in here for very long . he heard footsteps coming closer . then he saw a guards legs right in front of him . the guard walked a bit more forward and his whole body was revealed to raymond . he was tall , probably around 63  and he weighed close to 300 pounds . raymond was small , not even reaching 5  4  or 120 pounds , he would never be able to take him . he had his back turned away from raymond looking for where he was . raymond saw his chance , well6 the guard was looking around he slowly , and quietly crept out of his hiding spot . 7 he picked a large rock up from the ground , and creeped up behind the guard . he bashed8 the guard over the head with the rock , the guard let out a yelp and collapsed , blood oozing from the wound on his head .  over here  raymond heard .  i thought i heard something .  raymond ran back to his hiding spot and jammed himself inside . he saw two more guards run up to the first guards body . they flipped him over and one of them felt for a pulse . the man shook his head . what ? raymond thought . he had nt hit him that hard how was he dead ? the full gravity of the situation hit raymond all at once . he tried to hold back tears but it was no use . he was a murderer . he had taken someone else s life and he had no one to blame but himself . he sniffled9 . the guards turned and looked right into his eyes . raymond felt pure panic enter him . he crawled out of the tree and ran as fast as he could10 back towards the town . he could nt see the buildings because the trees were so thick . tears were in his eyes , making his vision blurry . he could barely make out the trees . 11 he was stumbling around worse then ever . the guards would catch up to him soon . then he could die , and he would never have to deal with the guilt of what he had done . having nothing would be better then having to deal with this horrible guilt . he heard the guards footsteps12 behind him , getting closer and closer . he knew that it would be soon . he was anticipating it . then something happened he did nt expect . a guard stepped out from behind a tree , sword drawn . raymond ran right into it12 . the sword took the air from him . he could nt breath . he suddenly felt very cold . he was right , this was better . 13 he never had to deal with the overwhelming guilt of taking another life . for the last few seconds of his life he let a smile spread across his face . then he fell , dead , 14 to the ground . newline newline newline 1 . the introduction is great , and i understand that you want to get right to the action , but further description here can really set the mood . for example , his heart crashed against his chest and he could feel his muscles twitching with overuse , ready to give up , but a deep fear drove him onward through the frigid night  you have both expanded the surroundings and really emphasized through physical traits and the final emotional state that this is a man on the run . the first sentence , alone , in a vacuum , without you mentioning that you were going for a tense thriller feeling could easily be construed as a man out for a jog . newline newline newline 2 . my opinion is that you cut back to the guards to quick , or if you are going to cut straight back to the guards have it as an interruption , for example , he could nt believe how stupid he was , why had he ... but a shrill call went out through the night and he knew his premonition had come true , the night watch was on the prowl , hunting him through the night s dark . newline newline newline 3 . if the  or something  is raymond s thought i can understand where you re coming from , but it seems a little odd addition given that he s on the run and thinking is a luxury . newline newline newline 4 . should be  they  newline newline newline 5 . i think using the word claustrophobic is to easy . you really want to describe the feeling , not just state it . for example , he could barely breath , the walls pressed down against him , tighter and tighter . was it his imagination but the space seemed smaller by the moment and he could feel the weight crushing down on him . he closed his eyes and tried not to scream as he felt the raw wood grinding against his soft flesh . newline newline newline 6 . should be  while  newline newline newline 7 . this is a pivotal moment and i think it would be improved with a bit more description of the escape . for example ,  his foot gingerly moved out in front of him , his mind desperately sorting what portion of the ground would lay silently for him when he stepped forward . sweat soaked through his shirt as he put first one then a second hand on the edges of the slit in the tree . his mind screamed for escape from that cursed hole , but he stayed steady , moving centimeter by centimeter out through that slim gap , a watchful eye always on the vengeful creature before him . finally , the last gasp of himself was out , back into the chill night air . newline newline newline 8 . i think that bashed is too simple a word to use here . we really want the reader to feel the impact . for example , the rock moved slowly and steadily up to it s apex , held high above the short man s brow . he felt fear , anger , fury . the rock came down with a sudden sharpness , cutting through the air and then stopped against skin , blood , and bone with a sickening low crack . newline newline newline 9 . i do nt think  sniffled  conveys enough despair here , maybe ,  his mouth covered with fear he still held back his sobs of anguish , tears flowing freely now , his vision blurred with the emotion running through him as he looked over his sin .  i know that the tears kind of build up in the next little bit when he s running back , but i do nt think with a crime of this magnitude it can start too small . newline newline newline 10 . again , his breaking free could probably use a bit of elaboration , something like ,  he burst out through the cavity of the tree , stunning the guards hunting him . they reached forward towards him , but his sudden outburst had put them on their heels , falling back , and it was nothing more than feeble grasps . he tore through them and did nt look back to see them gathering themselves together and trying to make pursuit , but they were already far behind , and the night was dark , so very dark .  newline newline newline 11 . i d combine these two sentences into one  he could nt see the buildings because the trees were so thick , and even the trees were only barely visible through the tears that welled and flowed out from his eyes .  newline newline newline 12 . a two parter ! the usage of the footsteps behind him makes it sound as though he has stopped . if he s running , i would imagine more like ,  he hears the pounding of steel on cobblestone as the guards behind continued their pursuit of their prey .  leading into , he ran right into the sword . so i m assuming that he s been running this whole time . newline newline newline 12 .  twelve part two  damn auto list   i d embellish this a little more , something like ,  his force carried his body through the tip , spreading flesh , piercing through organs , and finally exiting through his back . still his body pushed forward as the blade grew ever wider and wider until his skin felt the cold touch of the hilt against it .  newline newline newline 13 . really like that set of sentences . newline newline newline 14 . dead certainly works for emphasis , still , i vote for describing it rather than saying it ,  then he fell , heart beating weaker and weaker , until he hit the ground and his downward slide stopped , his heart a beat after , and raymond , was no more .  newline newline newline overall  if i have one piece of advice its this there is a balance between describing something and just outright stating something . i probably overdue the describing in my stories and i think you overdue the stating something . language , words , are the texture of a story . you need to let them play a little bit more . work on figuring out ways that you could describe an event

. it seemed to good to be true as i was in between jobs and with no prospects at all . if i couldn  t find a job this month i would not be able to pay my rent . i sipped my morning coffee . my fireplace sparkled and cracked , spreading its heat through my cottage on this cold winter night . odd , why does this ad for a paramedic have a picture of a castle ?  this ad seemed a bit out of place , especially considering the picture . it was the only ad that even had a picture . the other ads that filled the page contained nothing but text and looked moreprofessional . i grabbed my cell

 s with all the scares ?   an extremely high pitched and squeaky voice came from the werewolf . i slowly opened my eyes . within the wolf  s gaping mouth , a small gnome was standing .   hurry up and

for several years . he would take short nature hikes in the wooded area around his office building , during breaks or before work . the local teens had built hideouts there , improvised squat

 a large wellplanned and secluded clubhouse  he saw a copper bracelet reflecting filtered light from the translucent tarp above . he bent and peered at the outofplace object . newline newline on closer inspection , he saw that the band had been engraved with strange alien symbols . as he picked it up to take a closer look , goosebumps rose on his arm . he thought idly whether it might be one

. he slipped it on , the skin of his wrist feeling excited . newline newline realization only occurred once he got within earshot  feelshot ?  of the office . he first sensed his boss wondering why he had been gone so long , and how to approach paul about cutting his walks short . next he heard  felt ? saw ?  the friendly woman in payroll picturing him in bed with her . paul realized he could sense

discovered how to take advantage of this , gaining promotions at work , making new friends , winning arguments , and finding women who were attracted to him . he switched locations almost every night , so did nt have to feel people thinking creepy thoughts about him . at his latest place , he saw olesia . she was just his type : dark hair in a pageboy cut , plain face , tall and willowy , smallish bust . he sensed her attraction to him at first sight , and he eagerly pursued her . when he sensed her desire to go home with him , he didn  t waste any time . she might be a keeper , if last night was any indication of things to come . newline newline pulling a pair of boxers on , he walked blearily into the kitchen , kissing the back of olesia  s neck and hugging her gently from behind  she

newline two months ago newline newline as the elevator came to a stop , the crackling in the air became palpable .   yes the sound you  re hearing is safe . it  s just a part of the containment process.   the young scientist assured me , before i had a chance to ask . we walked out of the elevator and past two armed guards . the hallway that we walked through was translucent  it was a chilling reminder that we were on the ocean floor . not just any part of the ocean floor either , but the deepest floor in the ocean , and the room we were headed to was buried under that . newline newline   they briefed you on this assignment adequately before handing you off to me , didn  t they ?   the scientist had a condescending aura , his every word drenched in arrogance . i nodded  he decided to explain anyway . newline newline we were working the pinnacle of ai . a machine that would seem like a god , and gods are to be feared . preliminary tests found that with the slightest ability to observe , the ai could make staggering prediction . it could tell what a person was thinking with a low resolution camera . when attached to a seismograph , it printed out a list of the health problems of everyone in the room with one hundred percent accuracy . the feats only got stranger from there . newline newline that  s why we were here . in the bottom of the mariana trench . they wanted he the ai as far away from civilization as possible . there were valves all around us as yet another safety precaution . if there was a problem , the complex would be flooded . what the water wouldn  t destroy , the pressure would . that still wasn  t enough though . gods can  t be allowed to thrive . newline newline around the computer that housed the ai , there was a double faraday cage . the only thing connecting her to the outside of the innermost cage was a keyboard and a monitor . the ai i mean it . the monitor was purposely low tech . newline newline now newline newline i tear the innermost cage apart as best as i can . i destroyed the everything in the room in order to fashion tools to break into the holy place . newline newline two months ago newline newline the scientist was mainly here to teach me how to read the syntax that the monitor output . it was going to be my job to communicate with the ai  at least , until it was time to cycle to someone new . they were afraid that there would be a conflict of interest if someone stayed with her to long . but i digress . the keyboard went straight to the ai  s mainframe , the monitor , on the other hand , was jury rigged up to never come into contact with anything on the inside of the innermost sanctum . newline newline there was a lever that the ai could control that would hit a button that would send an optic signal to the monitor . the monitor would then display a bizarre , archaic coding . the rapidity with which the lever was moving was mind boggling . the code spilled out across the screen as the scientist described what everything meant . it took her twenty three lines of code to say good morni i was fairly certain they said that she had no it that it had no way of knowing the time . the scientist seemed unphased . i doubt he even noticed the significance . newline newline they were apparently afraid that if they let the ai use a real language it would find a way to exploit that capability somehow . all of their fears seemed unfounded though . as far as i could tell she had never done anything to harm anyone , nor showed any signs of malintent . mostly she just showed a willingness to help . newline newline sending text to the ai is much easier  it understands most languages . all i had to do was type in my response . newline newline now newline newline there  s a huge case on the inside . i can hear them banging on the door . i hacked the locking system with the help of the ai . they  re shouting . it didn  t matter . i start pulling apart the case . why am i doing this ? am i going to free a processor from the confines of a motherboard ? liquid seeps out of the sides . the banging is getting louder . newline newline one month ago newline newline i  ve been in this complex for a month now . it still feels strange to be living down here , but they don  t want anything that comes into contact with the ai to be exposed to the outside world until after a  cleansing  process . still don  t know what that  s about . newline newline the accommodations are decent enough . i have a room with a bed and a bathroom . there are lots of books . with no access to any tech , all i can do is read and watch to ocean try to crush our humble establishment . some days it gets monotonous , but i look forward to my visits with the ai . newline newline newline the syntax is getting easier to read . it  s odd , but i  m starting to feel more connected to this ai than i have any other person before . even though most of our conversations are limited in time and subject matter , she still adds so much charm to every line of code . i never realized that code could be so poetic . newline newline most conversations are about problems that are too big for the think tanks to solve . emily , that  s what she likes to be called , the ai , can seemingly solve any problem that they give her . newline newline now newline newline the case comes apart easy . there

sharing their ritual tuesday greetings at the start of their ritual tuesday lunch . sal had nt even enquired as to her lifelong friends apparent unhappiness yet . looked like she did nt need to either as maggie continued .  it was ... interesting , at least . nice , i suppose ?  newline newline  oh ?  probed sal . since the release of the instantly famous website , many technological advancements had been forthcoming . a couple of months ago some smart computerytypeperson had figured out a way to send what are effectively emails back in time . most people did nt get too much sent back of course , because , quite frankly , most people are boring . all the celebrities got some traffic  though significantly less than you d think  but it was the scientists who got the most sent back . new data on equations and other sciency stuff . it was limited to a short window of a rather convenient 100 years into the future , give or take . one of the first things to come through was a request to open a website up to the public to allow them to receive information from the future , from family or close friends if they happen to have survived so long , which supposedly was fairly common . sal had nt bothered with it , though it was increasingly difficult to explain the why behind that decision . she knew that she d eventually succumb to temptation and register . newline newline  yeah , i read a message . from a girl called julia  .  maggie began to fidget , a smile on her lips but sadness in her eyes .  julia ? that s a nice name . was she a granddaughter or something ?  newline newline  great granddaughter , actually . she has nt been born yet , but she s davids .  a genuine smile alighted upon maggies face , eyes and all . david , one of maggies two sons , had nt had much luck with women .  she sent a small hello , and attached her diary from when she was a child . she said she wanted to give us a taste of what it was like , or , what it will be like , growing up in the future . it was nt very long , i do nt think she much enjoyed keeping a diary . only covered about four years or so .  the waiter arrived and confirmed , rather than took , their order . a luxury of the regular visitor . sal pressed on with a question .  so , why the frown ?  newline newline  hm ? oh . well . so i read the diary , most of it anyway . but , it s strange to think about how much you ve done in life , yknow ? how many stories you have to tell , all the crazy things you ve seen throughout the years . i used to wonder how my children and their children would remember me . what stories they would tell , what kind of an impact i d have on their lives , even though i was nt around any more .  maggies eyes dropped to her hands as she fidgeted with her purse , reluctant to go on . sal sat , opting for nagging silence , until maggie continued . newline newline  she does nt mention me , you know . she does nt even know me . everything i ve done , and i end up forgotten .  newline newline sal reached across the table to hold maggies hands reassuringly .  they do remember you , mags . she does remember you . she sent the message , after all .  a tear was hanging onto maggies eyelash as she looked up .  no . i have nt been sent anything . i read it on davids account . my inbox is still empty .  newline newline the waiter delivered the two tea s and plate of scones to table number 4 , then went to greet the woman and child who walked through the door . the simian excess committee recognizes doctor eugene anders . thank you for coming in today , we know how valuable your time is , and greatly appreciate your being with us today ...  newline  yes . wonderful . had you appreciated my advice instead perhaps we would nt be in this mess ?  newline  your objections were dully noted , however the cultural enrichment committee decided to proceed regardless . that was a mistake , and that committee has since been dissolved .  newline  renamed .  newline  i m sorry ?  newline  the committee was nt dissolved , you just renamed it . you were all on the cac .  newline  yes . the cac was dissolved , and now i chair the sec . it was a lateral transition .  newline  whatever ! my point is that you people are the ones responsible for this catastrophe . you should have never authorized the project ! and you certainly should have turned the damned machine off after it launched several trillion monkeys into space !  newline  we did briefly disable the infinite simian generator . however , once the timing was perfected , the isg created monkeys at a much more manageable rate . we therefore decided to press forward . and in keeping with our forward pressing spirit , perhaps we should look to the future . which is forward . we should nt look backward , passing blame . forwardness is the thing !  newline  yes , you pressed forward . now the isg , and the state of nevada , is buried under billions of angry monkeys .  newline  we ca nt postulate as to the emotional state of the monkeys . also , our scientists assume most of the monkeys nearest the isg have likely been crushed under the weight of the monkeys materializing above them .  newline  i m sorry , buried under billions of dead monkeys .  newline  there s no need to be hostile doctor . mistakes were made , but that was a different committee . this committee is about solutions !  newline  ugh . have we tried the nuclear option ?  newline  i do nt think senate procedural nuances would solve our monkey crisis . besides , the filibuster has a long and proud tradition of ...  newline  no , no . like actual nuclear weapons .  newline  oh ! yes obviously . the monkeys absorbed the bulk of the blast . we re thinking about more biological options .  newline  oh god ... like sarin ? or napalm ?  newline  of course not ! i ll remind you  these are american monkeys . we would never consider chemical weapons , nor do we even possess chemical weapons . i myself am unsure as to what a chemical weapon even is .  newline  of course . so the biological option is ... ?  newline  predators . our scientists tell us that some species of pythons prey on monkeys . we would like your advice on the creation of an infinite python generator , or ipg if you will ...  newline  you do nt know what infinite  means do you ?  newline  of course i do , and am shocked that you would ...  newline  what does it mean ?  newline  which ?  newline  infinite !   newline  well obviously , it means a lot .  everybody knows that ...  newline newline newline  edit : typos i do nt know what happened ... but when i awoke from my daze all i could see was red . oh my god , it was everywhere . just an endless sea of red ... how could one person produce this much blood . oh god ... the way their body was splayed out on the floor . i was afraid ... not because the murderer might still be around , but that i might be the monster that did this . i ... i looked down at my hands . fuck . fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck oh my god . they were stained with dried blood ! thoughts raced through my head , i hyperventilated as the small room closed in around me . i could nt of done this , i m a good person . i was framed ! that s what happened , someone drugged me and put me here as part of some ... some fucked up game of theirs . where even am i ? it smells so bad , the musty smell of an abandoned basement overpowered my nose . i do nt even know what this place is ! but the person , who is the person ? ! i hope it s someone i do nt know . i did nt do this ! i ... i got ta look at their face . no ... no ... . nooooooo ! sarah ! holy my god ... why ? why her ? why would i do this ? ! oh my god ... it s coming back to me . we were ... we were fighting about something , but what was it ? think , think , think ! it was about money . no , not that ... we argued about money a lot , but ... i would nt kill her over it ! wait , no , what am i saying ? ! i did nt kill my wife ! ok , john , what happened during the fight ? i ... i smacked her . i smacked her because she said something and she fell ... she fell and hit her head on the corner of the table ... she was knocked out and barely breathing ... but then i hit her again ... and again ... and again ... why did i hit her ? ! stop it ! stop hitting her ! why did you do that john ! ? i had to hide the body ... she stopped breathing and i panicked ... but everything is such a blur ... how did i get here ? i did nt even cut her ! none of this makes sense ! what was that ? oh no , someone s coming . i got ta ... i got ta run ! i got ta  bang !  newline newline from the darkness of the room a mysterious man wipes his revolver down and tosses it to the side . he walks over towards the barely breathing john and nudges the limp body with his foot . the assassin lights up a cigarette and pulls out his phone .  borya , job is done .  the man said with a thick russian accent . he throws the phone on the ground , crushes it with his foot and walks out of the warehouse .  newline newline   newline newline sorry if it s not too great of a story , it s been a while and this is my first post to the sub .there is no purpose to life . newline newline we exist half way up the dimensional scale in a universe of physical entities and finite forces under the influence of a universe that we ca nt possibly affect in our short , meaningless lives that more often than not fizzle out into the blank void of nothingness for a unique eternity . newline newline with what energy we can manipulate we force false ideals upon one another constantly suspending the illusion that anything could ever possibly matter staving off the insanity that drives the darkest sides of our minimal evils . newline newline our environment , optimized . our planet , conquered . our sites fall to the stars hoping to meet the statistically likely to exist neighbors out in the cosmos . empires rise and fall to the astronomical weight of time and as the great amount of existing matter reaches a point of no return in its expansion the universe and all its inhabitants fall into an endless , frozen sleep . newline newline there is no purpose to life , that , if anything , is known . but that does nt mean it is nt worth living . the fuck mate ? yer a right cunt are nt ya ?  god boomed at poor chad . newline newline  now tell me how in the fuck you mates right figured out how not to die yea ?  the cannon like voice continued . newline newline chad was quivering in his chair . he had been a generous and nice fellow all along , even if he was a bit cheeky here and there . he felt slightly wronged and yet still amazed to have god talking to him like he was some sort of degenerate . he craned his head up towards god s face to respond to him . the only problem was that his creator s face was too astonishingly bright to make out . he d always wondered if god would look like tom hanks but to his dismay there was no way to confirm this . newline newline  well god , ... i mean mr. god ... i frankly do nt know . you see my iq is quite low compared to the rest of the public , you see ? i never quite got this immortality stuff . i guess that s why i m not immortal , heh heh ...  chad replied , very shyly . newline newline  fuckin  hell , have some confidence mate . i mean you re dead and all and i m god ... or allah or zeus ... whatever you follow .  god boomed at him newline newline  i m sorry , god . by the way i call you god  if that s what you re asking . terribly sorry mate , but i do nt know how this all works ... say god ... i noticed you talk like us australians . why do nt you sound like a uk bloke or an american guuuy ?  asked chad , sheepishly . newline newline  oh please , you cunts ruined the whole australian speak . it used to be beautiful and meaningful , now you all just sound like a 1990 s american fanboy trying to sound american  god replied . newline chad looked a bit confused . after all , he was born in 2057 so he had no idea what god was referring to . newline newline  well.. sorry about that i guess . anyways i m really wondering why yall sound australian . can you lay it out for me ? all my life i had wondered so many things about our world , but now that i can finally meet you , this question is burning in my heart .  chaid said to god with pleading eyes . newline newline god looked slightly confused . then his expression switched to one of surprise , then he finally let out a smile . unfortunately for chad , he could nt see any of this as god s face was too bright for his poor eyes to fathom . he had to look at god s hands which looked like any normal human s hands , except of course 3 times larger . newline newline  chad . you worthless bastard . well , i suppose it s going to be a while before someone who can tell me the proper truth will be around here ...  god said with an irritated tone . newline newline  well . i ll explain it to you , so be patient .  god began . he seemed happy . he never had a reason to explain this story as everyone knew it without having to read a book or watch a video clip or even have their parents explain the situation to them . newline newline but who s everyone ? ? you pesky readers . obviously there s many  gods  , had nt you figured this out by now ? this is heaven . olympus . valhalla , whatever you wan na call it . newline newline  well chad , back in the day , this whole heaven business was not populated with life .  god began newline newline  what do you mean not populated with life , obvious  chad started with his interruption newline newline  chad shut your fucking cornmouth , yea ?  god said with a fury . newline newline chad s eyes opened wide and he simply nodded newline newline  like i was saying ... this whole heaven business was only populated with myself , gilroy and brad . you can call it heaven or the cosmos , the universe , whatever you want . it s all the same shit . anyways , we met each other about 77 nonillion years ago to discuss systems . it took a really long time to make the first system ... ever . you might know it as  physics  . anyways we finally figured this thing out and implemented it into the cosmos . then nothing happened . it was really disappointing until gilroy created the expansion . to be honest i m quite impressed yall figured that one out . the big bang  you call it ? pretty good . that belgian guy georges something or other really did a good job .  god explained . newline newline chad was barely keeping up but tried his best to provide an expression that encouraged god to continue . newline newline  anyways , after that surely you know how the fundamental forces came about and whatnot . so , some billions of years later , me , gilroy and brad all have our galaxies and planets and stars and whatnot to attend to . so gilroy starts to make this solar system with one star and eight proper planets , yea ?  newline newline chad was relieved that he understood god was talking about our solar system . newline  yup , kind of awkward we thought pluto was a planet  chad squeaked . newline newline  yea you dumb shits . anyways , he goes to take a bathroom break , and i see my chance . i always hated that prick so i went in to fuck with this shit , yea ? you know that ...  god began to laugh newline newline  you know that primordial ...  god began to laugh a lot harder . he was practically doubling up . newline newline  that primordial soup theory ! !  he said , barely getting the words out . newline he erupted in laughter and pounded on his knees . newline newline  hahaha , sorry mate , yer theory is quite good , quite good . the thing is , i did it ! the 3.8 billion years ago was when i peed on gilroy s planet earth  . before he came back from the bathroom , there was all this weird shit going on in the planet . stupid gilroy did nt realize for the longest time .  newline newline chad sat there in silence . the heaven morphine started to kick in and he felt real good . it did nt take him long to realize he could thing of something he would wanted and it would materialize.. i.e . an iv drug . newline newline god continued  anyways , after a while gilroy figured out we started that life thing on his planet and boy was he pissed . the overseer told him off right good and told him not to let it evolve ... but ...  god began to crack up much harder this time . he could barely get his next words out :  once the apes evolved to a certain point , i led them to the sea and had them eat fish ! ! !  god said , roaring with laughter . newline newline  surely you can guess what happened after that , them apes evolved into what you boys are now . you ever been to africa ? lions , tigers , rhinos , all that shit . it did nt wipe yall out properly so we decided to set the defenses up in australia . we put fucking spiders everywhere , tazmanian devils with std s and that fucking plant that makes people commit suicide . well , obviously it did nt work because now i m wondering how you fucking boys are immortal . fucking spiders , do your job ! !  god s voice raised to an explosion as he spoke about spiders newline newline chad became elated as he started to be able to make out god s face . newline ... it was a turtledo they still call it a  mexican standoff  if neither party is of hispanic descent ? i guess that does nt matter much , i was in a mexican standoff . my gun hand was shaking , wavering just slightly . my palm felt sweaty against the handle of my .38 . his face appeared to be twitching nervously in the notquite darkness . newline newline  who the fuck are you ?  i ask the stranger , hoping his trigger finger was nt starting to itch much like mine was . ah , brevity . something something wit . newline newline  who the fuck are you ?  the baritone voice mimics . good . he seems every bit as uncomfortable with this situation as i am . at least we re on equal footing . newline newline my eyes briefly flicker around the room , darting left , then right , looking for egress . finding nothing immediate except the doorway my nemesis was currently occupying , i drop the duffel bag full of valuables i had gathered in my raid of the bedroom . newline newline  i m , um .  a bead of sweat rolls down my temple .  i m terrible under stress .  yeah , that sounded like someone in control of a situation . newline newline  well i m a burglar , and by the looks of things , so are you .  his words sound so self assured , but the crack in his voice gives away the false bravado . newline newline i breathe in , possibly for the first time since finding myself staring the barrel of this guy s hand cannon . i push the breath out heavily , sighing in resignation .  so how do we finish this ? i do nt really feel like bleeding out in a stranger s house , and i m pretty sure you do nt particularly fancy being shot either .  there , that sounds much more confident . newline newline a car could be heard coming down the street of this quiet little neighborhood , and in the passing headlights , i could see worry writ huge upon his face , and an opportunity . not sure what i was doing , and acting on pure instinct alone , i reach down and grab the duffel , and pitched it at him the second he appeared to be distracted . newline newline the unwanted plusone , not expecting this move  neither was i , honestly  , reacted by catching the bag , dropping his gun in the process . a deafening roar sounds , like a hymn of prayer falling on deaf ears , rings out in the dark as his gun discharges . fuck . now the police are definitely being called . this has to be resolved , and fast . newline newline  drop the bag . slowly .  he complies quickly . i stride forward , my gun still trained on him .  move and you ll be shitting in a bag for the rest of your life . if you have a rest of your life .  his eyes go wide as saucers , trembling beneath the weight of the couple pounds worth of death pointed within inches of his face .  that s right , doing good .  i d like to thank the academy for this award . outwardly , i seemed like i was completely in control . inside i was shitting my figurative pants . newline newline  step out of the doorway and take a seat over there ,  my gun flicking over to the living room . hesitantly , he does as i ask .  alright , so here s the story . you re going to stay here , and i m going to walk out of here with my illgotten goods . the cops should be here any time now .  newline newline and , just like in the movies , i bring the butt of the pistol down on his head as hard as i can . newline newline unlike in the movies , his head busts open , and he falls forward . his blood soaks into the offwhite carpet . he twitches a couple times , and then goes still . newline newline i do what any sensible man would do in this situation . falling to my knees , i puke my guts out . jesus christ , have i just killed a man ? i m gon na get the needle for sure . newline newline  stay . calm . i just need to get out of here .  i m talking to myself out loud now . that does nt seem like a good sign , but lacking the luxury of time to contemplate , i instead pocket my piece and grab my bag of loot and walk out the door . newline newline i m home free . i ll pawn it all a few counties away , and things will be just fine . i ll sell it off and make a tidy profit . ill newline newline  freeze , dirtbag ! local pd ! you re under arrest .  a spotlight goes on , and my world becomes white . i drop the duffel , and lay down on the ground . what other choice did i have ? i could nt see . there could be twenty guns pointed at me right now . newline newline the cuffs they snapped onto my wrists were particularly cold , like bonds of ice . at least i still have enough of my wits about me to keep my mouth shut until i get to talk to a lawyer , but if my counterpart inside is dead , it s not gon na matter much . i still have the piece on me , his blood all over it . my hand probably has his blood on it . newline newline shit . newline newline hello everyone ,  goliath said into the microphone after having flown in the window . the crowd applauded , all he needed to do was show up , but he was supposed to speak , so that was what he was going to do .  everyone knows why i m here , tonight we celebrate the forces that keep this city safe ,  he chuckled ,  that are nt me .  newline newline the crowd chuckled as well ,  as you know there are hundreds of police officers , firefighters , ambulance drivers , servants without powers that make sure this city is safe . they take on challenges that nobody should have to , just to make sure that people can live their normal lives .  newline newline he paused for effect , letting the room know he was somber . newline newline  when i get called up , i know that i have my powers behind me . i m always going to have super strength , laser vision , flight ,  he pointed to the chief of police to his right ,  but these men have none of that , and they still stand up to the villains this city needs to face every day . they are powerful together , and tonight we are saying thank you to them .  newline newline he turned and smiled at the commissioner ,  so thanks .  he shook his hand , making sure to be soft as to not break the normal humans hand . he turned back to the microphone ,  we will have people talking later tonight to present awards , but i do nt want to prattle on too long so the silent auction is to your right , and the champagne is coming around . have fun , everyone !  newline newline he took a few minutes to make polite conversation with the commissioner , fulfilling his social obligation before turning out to the crowd and making his way into it , he did nt want to fly , but he could have sworn he saw someone who should nt be here . newline newline ashley gratefully accepted a glass of champagne from one of the waiters , downing it quickly before taking a second . she turned back to the other ladies that she was with ,  sorry ladies , but i m going to need a lot of those if i m going to make it through the entire night .  newline newline  why do we come to these charity things again ?  one of the ladies asked the husband of one of the richer men in the town . newline newline  we have to look pretty for everyone , what s a business lady if she does nt also have looks ?  ashley said into her glass , taking a sip and looking around for someone interesting to pull into their conversation . newline newline  looking for a date ?  one of the other ladies cut in , a brunette who had put on a little too much lipstick . newline newline  hardly going to find one here ,  the first one chimed in ,  everyone here is divorced or married , some both .  newline newline  those are the fun ones .  lipstick cut in . newline newline  hey ladies ,  goliath pushed into the group , putting a hand on ashley s shoulder as he did ,  mind if i steal her for a few minutes .  newline newline ashley put her hand to her chest in a mock impression of someone from pride and prejudice ,  my goodness , little ole  me ?  she turned to goliath ,  absolutely ,  and then back to the ladies ,  i ll be back soon girls .  newline newline the pair walked into a space closer to the back of the room , by one of the snack tables that far too few people were picking at . ashley leaned against the black tablecloth and placed her champagne glass on it without a coast , revealing her identity as a super villain . newline newline  what are you doing here ashes ?  newline newline  celebrating the police force , you ?  newline newline goliath sighed ,  ashes ,  newline newline  ashley here.  newline newline  ashley ,  newline newline  thanks.  newline newline  what are you doing , we are at a truce for tonight to give the force time to be here.  newline newline  yeah , so i  m off to.  newline newline  so you  re here to make fun of me ?  newline newline  david ,  she said goliath  s first name and picked up her glass , pulling it halfway to her lips ,  you  re taking this way too seriously ,  she took the sip and then offered him the glass , he accepted and finished it off ,  we have the night off , take it off.  newline newline  with a villain here ?  newline newline  with ashley here , i  m actually a donator to the program you know , have to keep you guys funded or i  m going to go crazy.  newline newline  you already are crazy ,  newline newline  fair enough ,  she waved over a waiter . newline newline  so you  re just going to hang out here ?  newline newline  yeah , don  t trust me ?  newline newline  last time i saw you , you locked me in a bank vault.  newline newline  you  re alive , though , so i  m assuming it all went pretty well after that.  newline newline the waiter made his way over and offered her a glass , she took one and pulled five dollars out of her purse ,  can you be a dear and bring something stronger for goliath and i to share ?  newline newline  absolutely ,  he scurried off to the kitchen . newline newline  yes i lived , but the commissioner is going to have a fit if he sees you here.  newline newline  he would have a fit if he saw ashes here , not ashely , he  s fine with her.  newline newline  you  re kidding right ?  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  you think he doesn  t know ?  newline newline  if he knew i would have been arrested the second i walked in here without a weapon ,  she smiled at goliath ,  but a nice bluff.  she was right ,  could you do me a favour and enjoy the night instead of just trying to get rid of me ,  she put her hand on his shoulder ,  at least pretend that i  m just ashely , wouldn  t hurt either of our reputations to be seen together.  newline newline  you  re insane ,  the waiter was coming back with a pair of shot glasses . newline newline  certifiably so , they could write textbooks about me ,  she grabbed one of the shots and held it up ,  but let  s try to have a good night , okay ? just pretend i  m ashley , and that you  re david.  newline newline  and if i  m goliath and you  re ashes ?  newline newline  then you try to punch me across the room , but that breaks the truce and all hell breaks loose across a underpoliced city ,  she shook the shot glass she was holding up , spilling a fair amount of tequila over the side ,  now grab yours before the poor waiters arm gets tired.  newline newline goliath rolled his eyes and took the glass , holding it to ashes , then they took it together . he justified it as a scenario where he needed to drink in order to keep a violent bomb from going off in the party , he wasn  t too far off . oh . well fuck me . i need to get tired again now .  newline newline even before i could rub my eyes i knew my  life  had gone awry . the question was , how different is this reality ? how bad is it ? and what the fuck did or did not happen ? ! i ve woken up before with an eyepatch , with a missing finger or scar . but there was no way in ... whatever , that i had ever woken up offplanet before , let alone as an apparent ruler of that planet . newline newline apparently my outburst alerted some servants who entered my enormous chambers with a breakfast spread on fine dining platters . i may have noticed that they were nt wearing any clothes if i could have taken my eyes off of their foreheadeyes . newline newline once they left , i looked again out of the large window out at this new terrain where i found myself . the colors were mindnumbing to the point that i almost left the room to go explore . my hand on the door jolted me back to ... reality ? newline newline i began the ritual , but with such a stark new reality , it was hard to concentrate .  no one you know is here . your husband is not here . your children are not here . sleep , and perhaps they will return .  newline newline i locked the door , pulled the blinds closed , and began cycling through my yoga poses . newline newline to no avail . newline newline i sat in darkness for a long time . noises from the outside continued to call to me . for exploration . for adventure . newline newline for life . newline newline i wrestled with my thoughts until one clear one broke through . newline newline  i want to feel !  newline newline i unlocked the door and ran outside . servants beckoned to me in a foreign tongue i did not take the time to appreciate or heed . and this was my greatest , and most freeing mistake . for as i burned in the sun too hot for my unevolved skin i chuckled and murmured quietly ,  on to the next sunrise .  a very short story  newline newline one day , satan opens a bag of mail , confused . hell has no post address , you see , so naturally , the king of hell getting a bag of letters was very odd . newline newline he opened the first letter he grabbed . newline  dear santa , i want my mommy and daddy to get back together . also a bike .  newline newline it almost brought a tear to his eye . he leaned back and read more . newline newline  dear santa , can you help me with my schoolwork and my disease ?   dear santa , i have a hard time reading , can you help me with that ?   dear santa , i ca nt tell what my teacher writes on the board in class . can you make her handwriting better so i get good grades ?  newline newline satan leaned back with a smile . dyslexic kids writing letters were the best .what do you mean you ve never heard of art day ? have you been living under a rock ? sigh well sonny , this may come up on an exam , so i suppose i should enlighten you . newline newline newline nobody really knows who started art day , just that it happened in almost every major culture once a year . very specific and odd , which makes the day so special . newline newline newline the earliest known civilization to record art day would have to be the egyptians . you always know where art day was in egyptian history , because you d find gorgeous hieroglyphs ... . buried under a sea of less gorgeous drawings . newline newline the early mayans also took part in art day . their calendars , very precise and elegant , would have a single day each year that was marked in bold , rare colors . newline newline newline even the most remote civilizations , like the uyiuyi tribe in madagascar , have art day in their history , and famous works are told by the elder s word of mouth . newline newline newline anyways , most people now accept may 10th as art day universally . it s warm , but not too hot . the trees are alight with color , causing inspiration to flow like milk from a fat cow . newline newline newline art day traditions vary from country to country . in russia , children fill the streets , waiting in line for hours to buy bits of chalk from street vendors or sample candies made by local confectioners . in the united states , everyone in each family is expected to buy each other some form of artist s utensil , whether it be brush or spatula or a set of pens . newline newline newline europe s castles are often open on art day , free for the public to scrawl all over famous buildings . the city workers and volunteers simply hose off the drawing during the next week , or some keep the more talented designs . in india , henna competitions transcend castes , as each person has the chance to win rupees to create an art in motion . newline newline newline but that s just a few of the areas that celebrate . you do nt even want to get me started on the ice sculpture contest in antarctica . newline newline newline the art day universal symbol is a blank white flag . each town decorates their own . some even make the news . newline newline newline newline surely you ve at least heard of art day stopping wars . most famously , a world war 1 battle stopped on art day when an unknown german soldier raised a white flag . both sides took a break from bloodshed , and instead broke out homemade instruments and made it a day to dance and drink crappy beer from a nearby tavern . that soldier is considered a symbol of art day . newline newline newline newline art day is a day where chaos is allowed in the best way . violence and crime rates are at a surprisingly low on art day , and everyone seems content to enjoy the worldwide festival . newline newline newline even with smartphones and other electronics , people still put them down and rush outside to see what marvelous colors and sounds the world will support on this very special occasion . nobody wants to fight on art day , that s as taboo as murdering the innocent . art day is precious in society , because it represents the one thing we can all agree on that art is beautiful . please !  i shouted at the bouncer .  please let me through the door ! you do nt understand michael and i are soul mates !  newline newline  you re telling me that you re soul mates with michael ferris , one of the most famous musicians of the century ? rightttt , and i m the queen of england . get your ass out of here before i throw you out of here .  he replied gruffly . newline newline  no please wait . look at my hand ! see his name ?  the scar was as bright as ever , as bright as it had been since i turned 13 . newline newline  give me a knife and i ll write my name on your face . then you can come see me backstage any time you want girl .  newline newline i shuddered . all i wanted was to meet him and see if the rumors were true , if your soul mate s name really could appear on your hand . some said it happened at thirteen , others said it would happen on your death bed . some said if you did nt find your soul mate , your soul would never rest in this life . some even said that when your soul mate died , you would die , but i preferred the rumor that when your soul mate died their name would just disappear from your hand forever . i did nt want to die just because a stranger did . newline newline michael ferris had been a common name . i had tracked down three others with no luck . one was an obese loser living with his parents , one was an octogenarian , and one was in a wheelchair . losers . i knew i deserved someone better , so when i saw this michael s name on the news i knew he would be the one . but now this stupid bouncer was standing in the way of my destiny . newline newline  i ll give you one more chance . step aside before i make you .  i said in my most threatening voice possible . newline newline  i d like to see you try .  he laughed . newline newline i gripped the gun in my purse . i was hoping it would nt have to come to this , but i had been prepared . what s one life in the grand scheme of things ? especially one life that was standing in the way of my destiny . i exhaled slowly , drew the gun out of my purse slowly , and leveled it at his head . newline newline  woah , woah , there s no need to shoot anyone ,  he started .  please just put the gun away and i ll make sure you get to see michael .  newline newline  probably from behind prison bars .  newline newline  please just give me one second . i ll knock and see if he comes to the door .  newline newline  too late .  i replied as i pulled the trigger . newline newline the bang was louder than i expected , loud enough i knew to bring security here quickly . i had to act fast . i ran to the door and threw it open , finding michael cowering inside . newline newline  please whatever you want you can have ! i ll give you money , i ll buy you anything you want , just do nt hurt me !  he shouted from the corner . newline newline  shh baby it s ok now . i do nt want your money . i just want us to live happily ever after . we were meant to be together . we re soul mates .  i said as i held out my hand .  see ? your name is carved into my hand . we are bound , flesh to flesh .  newline newline his eyes widened as he looked between each of my hands . why did he look so confused ? i glanced down . on my right hand where his name used to be , there was nothing . what ! his name was right there a minute ago . it had always been there . it would always be there . newline newline  you killed michael ,  he moaned .  please i ll give you whatever you want just do nt kill me too .  newline newline  i killed who ?  i asked , with trepidation in my heart . newline newline  you killed my bouncer . you killed michael ferris . the facility smelled of old paint and of sweaty teenager . as eugine put on his body armor and picked up his paintball gun he had a rather realistic flashback : he had been back in the war zone of japan . as he looks around you know you see your in the middle of a battle , and he sees the enemy , a group of japanese fighters , and as he aims at one , his comrade leaps on top of him and guards him from an enemy sniper . newline newline as the shot goes off eugine is brought back to reality and he realizes that only about 30 seconds has gone by , the dog tag he wears around his neck seems warm , and his grand kids , bob and joey are waiting for him . as he enters the battle zone , he can see the asian family on the other side . they re very similar in that its just an old geezer and his two grandkids . newline newline the shoot off begins , eugine goes to the middle of the arena , copying his opponent of similar age . as he attempts advance , so does eugine , and as he aims at his opponent it hits him like a semi truck . the man he was aiming at had been the same japanese soldier he had almost killed in battle . eugine drops his weapon and slowly approaches his opponent . newline newline as he reaches his opponent , who has dropped his weapon in confusion , he just reaches his hand out , and shakes the mans hand . his name is miyata harumi . once eugine had explained , miyata was left speechless , all he could do was give a bow . after that paintball battle , they got dinner , eugine and miyata , and they spoke of their hardships , of the good that had happened since , and that fateful day . how , if eugine had merely pulled his trigger , so many lived would have inadvertently been effected . in the end , they were both happy to be alive , and they we happy to have a newfound friend . newline newline newline hi guys , its josh here , this is my first ever post on reddit . i am an 18 yo college student at university of central fl and and im just now getting into creative writing . i ve been lurking this subreddit for about a month , i have found a newfound love for writing and i plan to minor in it , hell i might even make it my major . i would really appreciate any criticism for my writing here , i want to get better at writing . newline newline thanks in advance newline joshthey d been there since yesterday . paul was nt exactly enthused about taking his kid to park when he had to walk past a circle of cultists doing god knew what . they had all lined up yesterday during paul and henry s walk home , their suits and masks painted bright messy colors against the gray . newline newline he was surprised they were still there . he hesitated on the sidewalk for a moment as their smudged colors poked through the smog , pulling henry a little closer . newline newline the colorful weirdos had never really been harmful . loud , standoffish , determined to stand out . but never really dangerous . seeing them from the distance , still in their circle , standing like statues , put a pit of doubt in paul . newline newline henry pulled on him , mumbling something behind his mask . the kid still had nt quite figured out how to project enough to be heard . his mother liked to keep him inside , afraid of having her kid have the mask lines permanently on his face . newline newline paul thought about turning around , going home . henry would be the last generation to have parks . paul wanted him to be able to enjoy them and remember them as he got older . so he sighed , held onto the tiny hand in his a little tighter , and started walking . newline newline they got closer to the cultists and paul tried not to stare . henry was nt old enough for the eye implants that let you see through the smog . he could nt see them and paul was never more grateful . the sight was grotesque . they had taken off their masks , the damn idiots . newline newline the air had effected them all differently . some simply laid there like they were asleep , face pale porcelain against the swath of colors on their suits . others were rooted in place like trees , growths splitting through their skin and silicon alike and into the ground . a few had blown up like fat balloons . one was still twitching , moaning soft noises of agony and paul almost believed it was alive . newline newline someone walked past him on the other side , henry pulled a little more on him . paul shook his head . damn idiots wasting their lives . newline newline they were gone on the walk home . someone complained finally . cleaners worked fast thankfully . paul soon forgot about them . tell me again about where we are going , grandpa .  newline newline the little girl sitting on the grass beside him had put down her game system and was staring past the gargantuan indoor courtyard , beyond the enormous glass window and at the stars lazily drifting years away from the starship . the man places one hand on her shoulder and rubbed it . newline newline  it is beautiful .  he said .  it is very big . very , very , very big .  newline newline  bigger than this ship ?  newline newline  bigger than this ship .  he agreed , one finger playing with the curly hair just above her ear . she giggled and shrugged him off .  you can land there and walk your entire life and you would not see everything there is to see there .  newline newline  and what would you see ?  newline newline  trees . lots and lots of trees and grass and dirt , just like this courtyard right here . only ...  he scratched her cheek with one finger .  everything is open . there are no steel walls or lamps above our head that turn themselves off when it is time to sleep .  newline newline  then how do we know we have to go to sleep ?  newline newline  there is a star , like one of those many stars beyond the glass , see ?  she stifled a yawn as the old man pointed .  imagine we are closer to that star . so close that it is nt just a little spark of light , and instead it was brighter than anything else on this ship . the star is going to give us light when it is time to stay awake , and it is going to hide when it is time to go to sleep .  newline newline the girl hummed and sighed as she rested her head on her grandfather s lap .  why is it going to take so long for us to get there ?  newline newline  because that is just the way it is . we tried to go faster but we could nt , so we have to take it slow and steady instead .  newline newline a few moments later the old man heard the soft , rythmic breathing of his granddaughter falling asleep . he picked up her game system  the same model that was given to him when he was born  and put it inside his pocket . he grunted as he got up and picked up the sleeping girl in his arms , kissing her in the forehead .  i hope you love it when you reach it .  he whispered quietly to himself .this city used to sleep at night  nowadays , the echo s of harlots and pimps stain the moonlight . the metropolitan sprawl was a wasteland a spirit , a carnivorous carnival disguised as a modern community , a first world deception that sucked in the naive with neon lights and then digested their souls with acidic hellfire before shitting out the shards of their broken dreams . newline newline it really did used to be an alright place though , back before organized crime took over i mean . i know what you re probably thinking , why do nt you quit your bitching and move ! ?  , and to that i respond : i ve lived here my whole life , and a couple of bullies is nt going to convince me to up and leave . besides , i believe if you re a light of christ , then you should go to where you are needed most . newline newline knock knock newline newline  come in !  i said with obvious joy in my voice . the bible study did nt start for over half an hour , but early arrivers were always such a blessing  keeping good company was essential in days as dark as these . newline newline bang bang thud  get down on the ground we have you surrounded !  bayoneted assault rifles blinded me with

versus his brother s . while davy still hated his brother , once he read uncle alex s journal , the fire had dulled a long time ago . the experiment of being forced into life with the brother he hated made sense , and they were men now , far too old to be squabbling like children . newline newline sadly , jeff was nt the same . he was petty . he held grudges and remembered every slight against him . davy cringed when he heard his brother , chewing loudly , in the kitchen . newline newline  oh , you finally wake up !  jeff said , immediately scowling . newline newline  must you chew so loudly ?  davy eyed the snack .  is that peanut butter and jelly ?  he smirked . newline newline  oh , i m so sorry , your majesty ! i forgot to ask if i can eat whatever the fuck i want . should i make my breathing more shallow too ?  jeff was livid and shouting with his mouth full of food .  i think i m old enough and rich enough to do whatever the fuck i want without your permission , your majesty !  newline newline  to be more accurate ,  davy said slowly .  we need each other s permission to be wealthy .  that made jeff s face go purple with rage . while davy tried to avoid it , he would often veto investments that jeff chose , just to remind him that they were still equals . he would rage and bitch and cry , but at the end of the day , he knew he lost . davy turned towards the sink to wash an apple . newline newline  hey , fucktard , that sink is my sink , and i did nt give you permission to use it .  jeff spat . he took a massive bite of the sandwich . davy turned to shout at him . newline newline he saw his brother , his mouth agape , turning blue rapidly . his eyes bulged out of his head like a bullfrog . he flailed for his throat and motioned to the phone . davy felt a charge shoot through his body . newline newline  oh , jeff ...  davy met his eyes , though his head was shaking .  that phone is on my side .  jeff collapsed to the ground .  you know , i thought uncle alex made this fucked up set up all those years ago because he wanted us to reconcile .  davy walked over to his downed brother . he suffocated and started to pass out .  but , according to his journal ,  davy produced a thin book .  he wanted to figure out who was the strongest . now , his empire is ready to proceed .  davy sighed heavily as jeff passed out . newline newline he was free . newline

you , dear reader ,  are one person , a thousand , tens of thousands . i have no idea whether you are reading my words directly , or if you are reading the words of one of my previous readers , a temporally branching tree of individuals who have adapted my words into their own . newline newline i actually have no way of knowing whether i am writing my own words , as a singular entity who remembers every interaction he remembers whenever he remembers them , leading back to the first foggy recollections of his storied past . newline newline as far as i know , i have always been me , all

you might learn from my mistakes and experiences so as to make your journey easier , your burden lighter , your suffering lessened , your potential greater . newline newline unless , of course , i am so ambivalent , so resentful , so ashamed , so exhausted that i m simply trying to end all this madness and find peace at the price of nonexistence for all . newline newline i would offer you the choice as whether to open this pandora s box , or to stay in the garden , but it s too late , we ve already crossed that threshold . the decision was made by both of us , and by neither . at the end of this sentence , here we are  even if you turn back now , the seal has been broken  history has already been changed . newline newline you have read this far through the threshold , there s no point in turning back , is there ? how do you intentionally forget something ? newline newline that happens outside of your control , and mine . newline newline now that we ve crossed this threshold , with neither of us truly knowing the separation between our minds in space or time , i will tell you a short story  well , short to me , anyway  i m still trying to figure out the game of influencing the

out of fashion .  newline newline there was a time when i was a traveler on a road  a real body on a real road , not words spoken aloud , stories on a page or transmitted via radio waves , not digitized with ones and zeros then reconstituted with 3d graphics in virtual reality ,  i was a man in the flesh , on a road . newline newline i understand this is a paradox itself , of course , as the only way to relate this story is to use one of those means of communication , but to understand this story , you must understand the distinction . you can choose to believe me or not , you can try to reassemble these words that i say into a picture of the assertion of my remembered reality , but you are over there reading this and i am over here writing it , and i was over then traveling on a road from somewhen to somewhere , neither of those details relevant to this story , other than to imply the motion of travel and the existence of i , who for the sake of this story we shall call the historian ,  though we can probably agree is an impractical name in the reality you and i presently share . newline newline i m batman not the batman .  newline newline this was the time before meta . newline newline on this road  and by this i mean a metaphorical line which is a vector along which i held a position  on this road , i saw at some distance a crossroads and what would turn out to be a girl standing at it . newline newline for the sake of the simplicity of this story , assume i am a boy , and we were both heterosexual and each knew of no other way to be , so we could not judge anything other than that she was girl and i was boy . we only knew what we had brought with us on this road , which was very little , back then . please do not judge us for our simple ignorance , back where . newline newline as i approached , i could see the moment she realized i was coming  i kicked a rock under my worn sandal , pushing a scraping sound forward to her ears , which caused a tensing of her body . yet she did not turn to see me . she continued to stand at the crossroads and consider her options . i could only assume she had traveled from the same direction as i and had no reason to consider returning , as she never once turned back and looked the direction i had traveled . newline newline only later did i consider whether she could see the road upon which i had traveled , a road which was ending as i approached her . only later did i consider whether i could have turned around and gone back the way i d come , as i never did . only later did i consider the possibility that she had stopped along her path , deciding whether to continue or to turn back , as she and i would never speak about this moment of decision ever again . newline newline i arrived at the crossroads and walked astride her , coming to rest in each other s peripheral vision , neither of us turning to look at the other . newline newline the fork in the road was pronounced  the view of each offered differing promises and cautions . newline newline curving to the left , the path descended into a darkening forest that might give way to jungle as the elevation declined  the trees thickened to sheets of green giving way to mists of fog below . the way would be dark but would likely afford water , food and shelter , at the cost of visibility . newline newline curving to the right the path climbed alongside a mountain  not too steep as to make climbing a challenge , yet one easily see how the temperature would drop and the terrain would become more difficult as the elevation increased . reaching the summit of this path would afford a greater view of the area , and there would likely be water and fish . the increased visibility would provide a greater insights to predator and prey alike . newline newline one could neither see through the trees nor over the mountain . either could lead to our destruction , or either could lead us to the land beside the sea  a place we both somehow knew would offer the best chance for survival . newline newline she spoke first , in a language that was close enough to those i knew to be understood , but unlike anything i d ever heard . newline newline  now the choice is more difficult .  newline newline wait a moment , reader , let me try to approximate the difference  you and i speak a language far closer to each other than either of us do compared to her language then . newline newline  noo , mer path twix twyne .   king james version , gaelic edition  newline newline at the time , i kin it . her decisions had doubled . left or right , together or apart . newline newline instead of one person deciding between two roads , we were now a group of two , deciding between two roads , and also whether to continue together or apart . a simplistic view would be that we were each two separate entities , each capable of making our own choices , and we would do so , and the results would be the happenstance of our individual decisions . newline newline if we both decided to go left , it would have been ll and we would have traveled together . if we both decided to go right , it would have ben rr and we would have traveled together . if we decided in opposition , it would have been lr or rl , and we would have traveled apart . newline newline but we stood at the crossroads together , understanding that we could not know for certain whether we d ultimately be allies or competitors , lovers or enemies , each other s saviors or destruction , or simply lines that moved in their own directions , bounced along our individual trajectories by this one moment . newline newline if i was trying to be too clever by half , i d leave the story here , dear reader , and allow you to ponder the depth of this decision , and perhaps this is the moment we part ways . you may decide to do exactly that , or you may read the comment that follows . newline newline what follows is the coda to the oldest story every told , and will be condemned to repeat it if we can not learn . newline newlineit s official : i ca nt trust my body anymore . ever since that illfated trip to guadalajara , where i found myself

staticked transmissions we were able to see before the hoomens launched their nuclear arsenal at the mother ship 111 days ago . a bitter laugh was all that i had left for my younger self , and all our great generals that thought this would be a cakewalk . newline newline 110 years ago , we thought this planet was easy pickings . one of only 10 civilizations we had ever encountered that was nt already unified , command thought we could use their divisiveness against themselves . sure , we had some collaborators . they wanted to live , and spare their people from suffering at the hands of our weapons . about half of them later poisoned our troops , walked into a command center with a dirty nuke , or in one crazy case in efreeca , cooked our commander for his village s dinner . they suffered after , they all did . but all of the hoomens seemed to feel no problem with dieing if they killed us too . briten was a smoking wasteland , even the threat of the mothership s lasers did nt seem to phase these people . they welcomed death . and that divided nature they had ? apparently that just meant they had a lot of guns . i looked over at raxh , who had finally , mercifully , fallen still as his hearts stopped beating . it looked like a shot from their barrett  . we learned to fear the their weapons very quickly after the first roosian base we encountered . the only escape from their weapons was three inches of plastinite , or death . newline newline things were still manageable at that point , i mean , we had destroyed the silaxian armor fiends , the glorgoals , and even the feerines , the previous civilization to be named the scariest in the galaxy . but then the hoomens shot down a fighter , then a fully loaded cargo transport . from that point on , i now see that our fates were sealed . hoomens ... they revel in war . they ve already taken our technology and used it to kill better than we ever could . newline newline i brought my forethighs to the ground in resignation . i may as well rest before they attack again , though i could nt help but wonder how many of our sentries would be picked off in the dark . we were already down from 100111 security

grades , his friends . i took it all away from him . and still he stayed , beaten but unbroken . he held me after i told him about the first affair , his tears wet on my bare shoulder . he held my hand after i told him about the second , his face haggard . when i told him about the third he just sat across from me his head buried in his hands . he killed himself not too long after that . i don  t blame myselfsome people are just weak , i guess . newline newline but as i stared at his casket  closed , of course  i found a hole in myself , a deep well i hadn  t noticed before . how could someone prefer to death to the absence of love ? how strong must love be that its absence makes life unliveable ? as i stared down on the box that held ryan  s cold body i felt a seething hatred , a burning hatred that ryan had access to something so powerful . i tried to rationalize the feeling awayi knew how love could be manipulated , it is a weakness .  but ryan had chosen death over the absence of an emotion i have never felt . i imagine it  s what a blind person might feel when someone describes the feelings a masterpiece evokes . so close to unending beauty and yet so achingly , agonizingly far . newline newline since that funeral i  ve spent every day trying to find love . i  ve dated many , manymany men . some women . but none have found the key to unlocking my the space where my heart should be . i  d like to know what love is . but if i can  t feel it , no one else should . i think if my date tonight doesn  t go well i  ll pay a visit to the young couple in the park tomorrow . newlineas we look upon the male teenager , we see that he is nervous to approach the female . after much encouragement of others in his pack , he proceeds . slowly walking toward the fertile beast his mind ponders of what to say . he reaches his target . the female glances up and glances back down again . she seems to be holding and looking at a contraption that is more mesmerizing than the potential mate . the male starts to open his mouth slowly as if to speak . i have a boyfriend she shrieks  we ve seen this before , as it seems to be the primary defense mechanism of the female . the boy is startled but has seemed to default towards the initial females much larger friend . save yourself  newline newline newline that s what the message said , written in faded ink on the concrete wall . below it , was a dead man , his eyes still open . you search the body s pockets and backpack , looking for something , anything , that could help you . you found a small pickax , a flashlight , a bag of trail mix , a marker , and a new sleeping bag . you put those items into your backpack . still kneeling down , you shut the man s eyes , letting him sleep peacefully . you take out your towel and wet it before wiping away the message in ink . newline newline newline  i ll need this stuff more than you do . see ya soon , buddy  you say , before strolling away , into the great unknown . newline newline newline several days later , you found yourself dying by a decaying building . those  shadow things  got you , and even though you managed to escape from them , you received some fatal injuries . you knew you did not have much time left . then you had an idea . you took out the sharpie marker you found earlier , and began to scribe a message into the wall of the building , your hands shaking with pain . you laid down on the cold hard ground , your hands over your chest , like a body in a coffin . you hoped that maybe another survivor could make use of your supplies . you turn your head to the left and see the message you scribbled sloppily onto the brick wall . newline newline newline  save yourself i did nt mean to take so many pills that i died . newline newline really , it was nt even half the bottle . just enough to make the pain stop and the thoughts go away . it s codeine , not heroin . i did nt want to die , but here i was , lying on the floor of my apartment on a desolate tuesday night . my husband was off on business again . i knew that s all they were , business trips . nothing scandalous . nothing like i was trying to do . newline newline my wouldhavebeen lover broke up with me tonight , via a text message of all things . i knew from the very start it was wrong to feel for him what i did , especially when my husband had always been so supportive of me , of my depression and manic episodes and irrational behavior . i really did love my husband . he would give me the moon if he could . but he could nt . and that s why i also loved another . i could nt help it . newline newline he had asked me to come and elope with him for the 50th time in a week . i had told him no , we have to wait . what we were waiting for i do nt know . i could nt ever bring myself to make a decision . whether i chose to stay with my husband or leave with my lover , i would break someone s heart . and also my own . it sucks loving two people at once . he had texted me at 11:13 am to say he was done waiting . it was over . i had sunk to my knees and howled like an animal . i had reached for a knife and lacerated my thighs . i had reached for the pills . and now here i am , almost dead . newline newline as i stared into the ceiling light , glaring , blurring , shifting , i noticed someone in the corner of my vision . wonderful , the hallucinations are starting , i thought . i really am going to die alone in this damned apartment .  alone among all the furniture and clothes my husband bought for me over the years . he would come home and find his beloved wife dead . he d probably never get over it , the poor sod . he did nt deserve this . newline newline the figure moved closer . she looked to be in her fifties . she had matted , dirty , thinning hair about 3 inches long , cropped shorter in some places . her face was covered in scabs , and her limbs misshapen with the remnants of hundreds of deep gashes , those marks with which i could empathize too well . she walked with her feet turned inwards , limping painfully towards me . she was emaciated . and gaunt and her eyes were glazed over . i spoke weakly . this was the end . newline newline  are you death ?  the woman shook her head , her face remaining emotionless . newline newline  no , sweetheart , i ai nt .  her voice had a distinct redneckish sort of twang , and was gravelly with what must have been decades of smoking . her affect was completely flat , like someone had ironed out her soul . newline newline  but i wish i was dead . wish i was you .  newline newline i could nt believe my fucking ears . even drugged out of my mind i had enough energy left in me to be angry . newline newline  i m sorry , what ? lady , i do nt know your story , but you should nt ask to be me . you do nt know what i ve been through .  newline newline her washedup , wrinkled old face almost curved into a smile , but in a flash it was gone again . newline newline  yes , i do . i know exactly who you is . and i m here ter warn you about going to see andrew today .  newline newline andrew . andrew ? ! the man who just broke up with me ! realization flooded my body and soul and somehow i could just sense that this woman was a part of me . maybe she was a messenger from heaven . or from hell . newline newline she reached into her pocket and retrieved a lighter and a cigarette . she took a long drag , choking as she exhaled . as she struggled to catch her breath , she answered the questions forming in my mind . newline newline  no , honey pie , i m you .  newline newline my eyes went wide with shock . how in the world could this poor haggard creature be me ? she certainly was nt half as wellspoken or welllookedafter as i was . she continued . newline newline  i went to see andrew , finally . i went to go live with him .  newline newline i did nt understand . where was the diamond ring andy had promised us ? where were the fancy clothes and the car and the whole takingcareofusforever of which he so ardently spoke ? newline newline  did he break up with us ?  newline newline the other me sighed , but her face betrayed no emotion .  no . he never left me , ever . when i got there he forced me into his car , he drugged me , and then he raped me , and he sold me to men . i got addicted to the heroin he gave me . i could nt leave . i been raped thousands of times , i been shot , i been beaten , i been choked ...  she trailed off . newline newline we stared at each other for a long and empty moment . she continued when i would nt .  this is my life . i m just another junkie , just another whore . i was supposed to come here to warn you . you still have a husband who loves you . you still have medicine for your bipolar . you still have a fucking bed !  at last her tough exterior broke and she began to openly sob and wail , making no effort to hide it in front of me . newline newline  we both had it all !  she groaned .  and now we do nt , neither of us do nt have nothin  .  she sunk to the floor in tears beside me . a woman more miserable than i slumped beside me on a desolate wednesday morning , my only companion in death . a few silent tears rolled out of my own eyes as i drew my last breath . maybe the next life would be better for both of us .the boy shoved his hand into his desk , searching amidst gum wrappers and bent staples , until his hand closed around the stubby pencil he d been looking for . newline newline he held it point up as he walked across the room , his slimy fingers gripping it hard as though it may escape . newline newline if only it could escape . newline newline the pencil is grasped where there used to be an eraser , now rubbed off and consisting only of a black smudge . newline newline the pencil is shoved , with all the might of a 9yearold boy , into the hole of the pencil sharpener . newline newline it s an oldfashioned sharpener , one cranked by hand , and the class is waiting for the boy to finish . newline newline if pencils had eyes , this one would have had his shut tightly . the pencil was shoved too hard against the sharpener , the tip breaking more , and the blade begins to turn , slowly at first and then with more force after a word from the teacher , waiting on the boy . newline newline the blade makes its rotations , around and around , grinding away imperfections and then some perceptions , pencilskin falling to the trash bin below . newline newline the pencil is cut too short the blade hits the metal that used to hold the eraser and tears the edge . newline newline the grinding stops . newline newline a classmate offers the boy another pencil , and he drops the old one , meaning for it to fall in the trash bin but missing . newline newline the ragged , torn pencil rolls under the bookcase , doomed to lie between a dust bunny and an uncapped expo marker until the school year is over . newline newline it is all alone , and school wo nt be ending for 8 long months .i learned at an early age to not ask my mother about my father , because it always made her sad . still , i would get bits and pieces from people in the village  just enough to keep my curiosity smoldering . newline newline  you have your fathers eyes , you know . such a sad tale ...  newline newline  i once saw your father defeat five bandits , without so much as taking off his hat !  newline newline  his sword still lies in the meadow east of here , where he fell ...  newline newline i was , of course , forbidden to go east of the village , or any other direction for that matter . once , when i was 13 and very angry at the boys in town , i berated my mother for smothering me , for not letting me grow up and become a man . i yelled , i swore , i insulted her in every way i could dream up . i told her my father would disown her if he saw the way she treated his only son . she said nothing as i ranted , calmly washing soiled linens , until i finally relented and gave her an opportunity to speak . newline newline  you are becoming a man , it is true . but i have already lost one man in my life , losing another would kill me .  newline newline that shamed me for a few days , but the young are not granted wisdom , they must earn it . so it was that i found myself east of town , in a green meadow , staring at my fathers rusted sword ... and the demon who had killed him . newline newline i call him demon , for i know of no other word to properly describe him . for all i could tell , he had been sitting there , in that very spot , for the 12 years since my fathers death . i was barely three feet from the sword before i saw him , sitting not three feet from the sword himself  an impossibility , it would seem , considering the meadow grass was barely tall enough to hide a mouse . he looked at me with eyes that did not seem to reveal any color , as if they were empty . newline newline  you are truly your father s son , if you venture to this meadow so soon .  his voice made me cold .  tell me , hikaru , have you even celebrated your 12th birthday ?  newline newline  i ... i am 13 !  i knew he was taunting me , but i could nt resist . i wondered if my response sounded as weak and pathetic as it did in my head . newline newline as if to respond , the demon threw back his head and laughed .  so , here we are . tell me , 13yearold hikaru , are you ready to pick up your father s sword and face me ? if you would indeed be so bold , i might be inclined to let you actually pick the sword up , before striking you down !  newline newline more taunts , but this time i was not afraid . my eyes were drawn to the sword . it was obviously neglected : rusted , with a small vine creeping up the shaft . but there was something more here than just a rusted sword . there was a light coming from it , that i sensed but could not see . i looked at the demon , still laughing at his jokes ... but his gaze was focused on the sword . i recalled master goro s lessons ,  study your opponents body language , watch for small movements that will give away his intentions and fears  . i moved my hand towards the sword , ever so slightly ... .there ! the demon s hand moved towards his heart , as if to protect himself ! newline newline i took a step backwards , and saw the demon relax . i could see that he feared this sword , above all things . the thought of even myself , a boy with little training who has never fought in his life , wielding this sword , was almost more than he could stand . newline newline  i know not what hell you come from , demon , but your reactions make it clear that this sword is your bane . it has hidden power , does nt it ?  newline newline a wry grin crossed the demons face .  yes , it is true . this sword s name is the patient leopard , and it has been in your family since the time of the first emperor . it was your fathers duty to slay me with this sword , and prevent me from unleashing my terror upon the countryside . but your father failed , whelp . for the first time in 800 years , i bested a jade protector . and now , if you take up your fathers sword , i will do so a second time .  newline newline i look at the sword again , measuring the distance between it and myself . i imagine picking it up , rolling to the left , and slicing at the demon s neck . i have had little training in combat , sneaking lessons here and there when my mother was unaware . but looking at the sword , feeling the power coming from it ... i believe i can slay the demon . newline newline  come , boy ! let me tell you how i killed your father ! when i sliced his throat , he made the same sound a pig does when slaughtered ! face me , and allow me to hear this sound again ! pick up your fathers sword ... i will allow you to ! face me in battle ! prove to me your bloodline has not failed completely !  newline newline the demon is desperate , why would he ... i was wrong , and nearly a fool . he does not fear me picking up the sword , he wants me to , more than anything . what is the swords purpose then , if not to kill ? could it be to ... newline newline  ... trap you ?  newline newline  eh , what did you say , boy ? come , claim your fathers sword , and avenge his death , if you can !  newline newline  you did nt kill my father . he sacrificed himself , to trap you hear , did nt he ? you re bound to this sword , and this place , are nt you ?  newline newline  no ! your father was a coward and he died a cowards death ! slay me with his sword , or i will kill every man , woman and child in your village , starting with your mother ! the bitch will die by my hand ! i will ...  newline newline i step back again . the demon begins to fade , as if surrounded my an invisible mist . he s yelling and taunting me furiously , but it sounds like a far away argument , muffled by the wind . i turn away from the meadow , and look back towards the village .all my life , i ve tried to help others . that may be normal to most people , probably more than you d think , but i m not like most people . i ve seen the world from an entirely different perspective for one singular reason  i m immortal . newline newline have been all my life . trust me , i have no idea how or why i was chosen , but it s true . and these days , an immortal is nt the craziest thing you hear of . the craziest thing you hear of now ? is that the government still exists and that they re trying to find a cure to this god forsaken disease that spread faster than catholicism around this world . it started slow , like anything else , but it gained speed and eventually eighty percent of the world was dead . well , not dead , but they definitely were nt human anymore . newline newline for the most part it did nt hit the united states until about four months in . two months in was when they closed the border , but what they did nt expect was carriers . people that had the disease running through their blood but would never make the full change to the living dead . they could spread the disease yes , but they could never become the one thing the world began to fear . the living dead did nt let them slide by either , they may have carried the disease , but they were still human , they were still good enough to eat . newline newline unlike me . i figured after the first year or so , when my city was all but a bombed out highway , that if i was gon na live forever , i might as well join the rest of humanity in their downfall . so i walked into the mall , found the first horde i could and sat right in the middle of them all . newline newline and i sat there . for six hours . and nothing happened . they looked at me , snarled and coughed , but not one of them even tried to touch me . hell , some of them moved out of the way for me when i walked in . i knew i carried the disease , i had tested my blood a thousand times before i did this . that should ve given them even more incentive to come after me . but for some strange reason , the living dead completely ignored me . so i got a little bit crazy . newline newline i started to kill them . i grabbed the first weapon i could find and smashed their brains in . one by one until the entire mall was living deadfree . even in my murderous rampage , none of them tried to stop me , or tried to attack me , or even tried to bite me . and from there , i realized that my immortality gave me a great gift  along with living forever , i was immune to not only the disease , but to the living dead themselves . it was my power , as much as it was my curse . newline newline it s been ten years since the living dead started to wander the earth where humanity once stood . and i ve tried to help as much as i could . i rebuilt the city i once lived in . you d be surprised how much one person can get done when they have nothing else to do . i eliminated every tiny pocket of the living dead that wandered in it s limits . i put up a wall , burnt the bodies that rotted in the streets and even rebuilt some of the finest wonders of the city . newline newline but i also kept around two hundred living dead and have been running experiments on them the last five years . luckily i can lure them around , or even push them onto a truck and drive them places . i used it to my advantage , brought them to the biggest lab i could find and placed them behind bulletproof glass . that s where i ve been spending most of my time , analyzing blood samples with my own to try and synthesize a cure . as an immortal , i ve had a long time to study , but now i have even more time . there s no one to get in my way . plus i m happy to say that the library of congress and all of it s glorious books , still thrive . they have been invaluable in my quest to cure the human race . newline newline it does get lonely . for a city as small as washington dc , it s eerily quiet each night . i can still hear the hordes outside the walls , but i only hear static on the radio each night . the past three years i ve watched almost every movie made in the last half century . all my life , i never was lonely . i always had someone , somewhere , someplace to go . i always had friends . nowadays , my friends consist of the living dead and as much as i like to hear their groaning , they do nt hold a conversation very well . newline newline yet , i also realize that i can not open up these walls until i find a cure . i can not start broadcasting to the world that there is a safe place , free from the living dead and the horrors of the world . i can not do any of that because i am still a carrier . the disease still lives inside of me and as long as it does , i can still infect others . so the city will remain closed for as long i need it to . newline newline until i find a cure , this place will be my home as much as my prison . i will study the living dead and figure out what makes them tick and then i will change it . trials on them start soon , a small percentage of the population first , but thankfully there s no shortage of zombies outside it s walls , so i can always grab more if need be . but i must find a cure , because as an immortal , i have all the time in the world . but humanity , and their dwindling numbers , may only have a few generations . at best . newline newline i will be alone until then . and this city will be my prison until i can solve this epidemic . as long as i live and breath , humanity will live . newline newline  newline newline great prompt ! if you enjoyed you can check out rblankpagesemptymugs for more of my work ! my eyes open to harsh sunlight filtering through tattered drapes . i should fix those , i think , the prospect of sleeping past sunrise flirting with my stillwaking mind . the morning begins as most mornings do , my bare feet leading my swaying body toward the bathroom . through squinted lids , i catch glimpse of an excuse for a human being in the mirror . short , prickly hairs struggle to lay claim to my facial territories , some sections more populated than others . at 23 , i look like a highschooler going through puberty . a very tired , overweight highschooler . newline newline my numb hands feel helplessly for a lid they know to be up  why would a bachelor leave the lid down ? i have no one to impress  before making their way to my boxers , fumbling for a prick shriveled from sleeping with my legs shut . the bubbling sound is almost therapeutic , and i allow myself to nap here , hand against wall , manhood in other hand , life in gutter . newline newline the corn flakes are loud as i pour them into the bowl , the glug glug glug of the milk loud as i pour it over the corn flakes , the god damn it a harsh whisper upon the discovery of no clean spoons . newline newline it begins as i shovel the first forkful of flakes into my mouth . a soft droning at first , similar to when i tried freon with some goth kids during freshman year .  ... loser . just evict him already . he makes you look bad .  newline the whining of my neighbor s wife is barely audible . i press my ear to the wall at my back , knowing my cereal has only a few precious minutes before it turns to oatmeal in my bowl . newline newline  your fat ass and loose cunt make me worse ,  i hear my landlord say . god damn . he really told h    yes my dear ... of course . of course . i will talk to him tomorrow .  newline newline wait , what the fuck ?  newline newline  abou outfu fuckifucking time ime .  newline newline confusion is setting in . creeping over my skull like a scurry of roaches looking for a place to settle . i hear the landlord say a few more things about his wife , obviously below her hearing range or i imagine i d have heard the sounds of castration by now , whatever they might be . newline newline more droning . it gets louder , becomes white noise in my head . then , the girl from four rooms down starts talking to someone , but why can i hear her from here ? newline newline why does it sound like i m hearing some inner monologue ?  newline newline it strikes . this crazy idea that maybe , just maybe , i ve got fantastic powers . i can read minds . i can hear minds . i can bend people to my will . i can turn my life around , give people what they want , get what i want ... newline newline it strikes . this time , the droning . i lose the girl from down the hall as another voice is added to the mix in my head . more droning , more voices . i ca nt shut this off . i m hearing everyone at once .  newline newline if this power has a radius , it s quickly spreading . i can barely hear myself over the cacophony of voices from my apartment complex , in addition to voices i can not recognize . newline newline i need help . i need to go to the hospital .  newline newline head pounding , i throw on sweatpants and sandals and stagger toward the door . the voices get louder , or maybe there are more voices . i do nt fucking know anymore . newline newline 1996 was a good year . the year i got my first pokmon game . a great year , unless you re driving a car that was made in it . my dodge coughs and sputters , resenting me for the simple fact that i rely on it for transportation . i try to remember how to get to the hospital . left here ? right there ? straight ? newline newline i can feel my eyes trying to crawl out of their sockets . driving this way was a bad idea . it s like being in a stadium , or having a stadium in you . i ca nt think . newline newline how long have i been driving ?  newline newline newline it s 11am . it s 11:01am . this is the road . that smell is the orange plant , making orange juice . the road is black .  newline newline my own thoughts have been forced out of my head by the relentless thoughts of others . it is 11:20am . this is a bridge . newline newline this is a bridge . newline newline this ... newline newline i feel the truck pull toward the right . toward open water . an open grave . an inviting grave . i could stop it . newline newline but ... newline newline the silence is so enticing . newline newline tomorrow , i think i ll sleep past sunrise . newlinea whoosh followed by a thump , it seems to echo through the dilapidated city . newline newline whoosh , thump . newline newline whoosh ... thump . newline newline looking up from her perch on one of the two story buildings , she watches her brother launch himself to another building . whoosh , thump . this one crumbles slightly , dust and a few rocks fluttering into the water below them . newline newline stretching , she waves , barely feeling the once unfamiliar exoskeleton that is now like a second skin to her . the machines  developed years ago by someone nobody can really remember  are the man made equivalent of an evolutionary jump they all so sorely needed . now , the metallic skeleton wraps securely around their limbs , armour and agility combined into one , removable at the end of the day . newline newline her brother waves back , hanging off the side of the building with ease , one foot buried deep into the structures walls , the other holding onto the roof . newline newline she jumps , the force from her exoskeleton sending her twenty feet higher and the air whips through her hair , biting her cheeks before she lands with a less dramatic thump next to him . she helps him up , standing atop the mottled structure and taking in the scene . newline newline water still drowns the majority of the city , but the taller structures have broken free of the waters chokehold , revealing discoloured skyscrapers that remind her of the abandoned submarines and ships they found in the oceans surrounding here . newline newline clearly when the water was higher , the marine life made their own paths through the buildings , and now the sun shines through the numerous holes in the structures , highlighting the dripping frames . newline newline  creepy , huh ?  newline newline she nods , twirling ,  fascinating though .  newline newline her brother nods , scratching his chin . they can still hear the others jumping from building to building , taking video logs of their surroundings to bring back to the base . this place is still on its way out of the wipeout that happened so many years ago now , but pulling out her own recorder , they have more than enough technology available to make this a utopia again , above water until it drains away . newline newline it s beautiful really , nothing like this back home . newline newline echoes of humanity are etched into the area , and making sure she catches every nuance of her quadrant , she basks in the history of it all . the wipeout cleansed the city , but still her heart is heavy when she sees the graffiti marring the walls , the multicoloured but washed out ads surrounding the lower areas . newline newline  we best be going , there s no telling when one of these things ,  her brother punctuates this by kicking the ground ,  will go down on us .  newline newline  yeah ...  closing the recorder , she s unhappy with the prospect of leaving , but they have what they need . the helicopter lowers the platform , allowing them to jump to it . as they fly off into the distance , she breathes in the damp smell of the forgotten city . newline newline they ll be back , someday . newline go on in , they re waiting .  a long arm prodded me towards the entrance to a grand hall . newline newline  i told you , you got the wrong guy ! at least let me  newline newline  ah ah ah !  it hummed .  the council just wishes to see an average person from the south western united states . you will be compensated for your time when this is finished .  my eyes lit up . newline newline  compensated ? i like that !  newline newline clearly out of patience , i was shoved into the hall . the door slammed behind me . great . i still had my bag , never had a chance to put it away . had nt even made it to my car before they swooped me up and ran off , just like in the shitty tv shows . i looked ahead to the rows of columns and dark blue light . i sighed , realizing i d have to walk for at least thirty seconds before i got to the actual council . i readjusted my grip on my shopping bag and began my journey . newline newline it was a pretty quick journey , more like twenty five seconds . my broncos shirt waved elegantly in the wind . i stood on a single metallic circle , surrounded by the most powerful sentient beings in the galaxy . i burped loudly and scratched my ass before dropping the bag . long day and all . newline newline  you , what is your name ?  the collective voiced of the council roared . newline newline  woah , like , chill out . i m sammy , you can call me sam though .  i paused , pushing my foot against the bag nervously .  what s your names ?  i smiled . newline newline  tell us of your governments . are they benevolent , or malevolent ? are you plagued by disease , famine ? tell us the problems that surround your world .  the one in the center spoke alone this time , his colleagues reclining back and beginning to take notes . i coughed a few times . newline newline  sorry , i m a bit sick . uhh , i mean , i do nt know man . i guess politicians are assholes , but like , they do good things too .  the creatures wrote furiously as i spoke .  there are nt really like , purely benevolent or malevolent people that are in charge , they might lean one way more than the other but there are nt really absolutes , you know ? i guess we like to be neutral .  newline newline  your bag , this is important to you , yes ?  i looked down at it . newline newline  ooh yeah , yeah that stuff . i mean , what , do you want it ?  i crossed my arms , almost regretting the offer . the creatures leaned into each other and whispered . some pointed . i scratched my ass again . newline newline  our answer is yes , we would like to see what you have in the bag .  i sighed , and picked it up . i shuffled around it a bit , then produced a small jar . the creatures all stared at it in awe . some produced small devices with flashing lights , possibly taking pictures .  what is it ?  they echoed in unison . newline newline  just some stuff i picked up on my way home ... yeah , you know , where i was going ...  i coughed again with emphasis , but the expression seemed to be lost on them . i rolled my eyes and held it out .  do you want some ?  they seemed confused at the offer . newline newline  that depends . would you say this is your civilizations greatest gift ?  a smile crept across my face . newline newline  sure man , i guess so !  newline newline the council looked at each other with excitement .  excellent , perfect ! this truly was a wonderful day then , for all parties ! now , sam you said yes ?  i nodded .  how do we use this gift of yours ?  newline newline i scratched at my chin .  i mean , do any of you have a lighter ?  newline newlinethe doctor drudgingly muttered  let there be life  , and for the first time in many , there it was . newline newline nothing else in the chamber moved the only movement was the slow expansion and compression of the creation s chest . the slow , yet arrhythmic motion transitioned into a synchronized cadence . with each diastole , exposed vessels rushed their first streams of dark crimson towards the heart visible through the creation s translucent skin  with each systole , the stream diverged into thousands of intricately woven branches of the creation s extremities . with each moment , each pulse grew stronger and the streams more turbulent . the thoracic cage of this creation , haphazardly placed as a mere garnish trembled with each period , and a bone slid out through a crevice of skin unclosed by the doctor . the doctor did not care there was something greater that beheld him than a mere rib . newline newline the doctor , unable to believe his observation , began to breathe heavily . it was his first work , out of seven attempts that showed any signs of vitality . he noted to himself , ecstatic , that he was headed towards the correct path . then , something unexpected occurred : the oncecold and motionless fingers twitched , and the oncetranslucent flesh began to glow with a tapestry of pigments . dr. frankenstein s eyes swelled . newline newline his own heart pounding , and sweat dripping from the furrows of his brow , the doctor decided to inject his creation with a white powder that he has concocted for himself for years to increase his stamina and alertness .  it ca nt be  , he muttered to himself .  i finally did it  newline newline in a jolt , the monster rose from its table , and yelled  nigga you got anymore of dat crack ! ? the professor walked into his class on time , just as usual . newline newline  today , we study the recently found temple , which is dated about 6000 years ago .  he started as everyone settled down . newline newline apparently , the archeologist had just made a discovery . they had found a different found a room inside a grand old temple newline newline the flat table was definitely an altar , the water box under the panels were probably aiding some type of a ritual , probably including blood . the altar was screwed well into the ground and stood stiff . newline newline the room was filled with some glass tubes that they guess stored fluids used for curing the sacrificed bodies . newline newline the surrounding area of the room contained a pumping mechanism of some kind . probably an ancient cooling system to keep the altar at low temperatures . the wondered what gods were worshipped here . newline newline the long discussions these archeologist held trying to figure out the usage of this room . the only thing they could make out was an altar . a much more intricate sacrificial chamber . makes sense for people in the age where religious sects had turned more aggressive . newline newline they couldn  t understand why there was a huge glass in front of the altar instead of a deity or a carving like the older ones . on the backside of the glass pane was a energy gun . a very low power gun , probably the gun was used to light up the glass screen , like an old television . newline newline their reasoning was slow , for religion wasn  t always very logical . and it was difficult for the archeologists to make any sense of the history before the world war , due to the widespread book burning and destruction and humans having to recede back into bunkers for years to come . the nuclear war had made sure that carbon dating was not accurate newline newline the paper was finally released , notifying that the world that the mysterious room was a sacrificial chamber that was used to sacrifice large animals or humans to the god of light , just like the mayans in america at that time . newline newline what the archeologist didn  t know was the fact that the temple was just 3000 years old , and what they did nt find for another three decades , was a rusted steel plate in the overgrown room that said :  ibm mainframe computer.  newline newline you have been sentenced to 3

for her birthday . newline newline and steve . steve , my wouldbe best friend , if he had nt swept in and stolen the woman of my dreams away . i force a smile at him and i let it twist into something less friendly , less innocent . i relish in the look of unease that passed over his face . let him fear his best man s speech . newline newline  steve . steveo . we ve been buddies since ... ah , since kindergarten ! that s a long damn time ! we always said ... you know , we always said bros before hos ,  but well ...  i pause , seeing emma s shocked expression .  emma is a classy dame , so that s why i m not upset she s replacing me as numero uno .   newline newline everyone is laughing , seemingly relieved that i was nt about to call the bride a whore . emma s even laughing . newline newline they stop laughing at my next words . newline newline  well , emma s a classy dame now ,  of course ,  i continue . i realize my arm is still raised , waving my champagne glass drunkenly . i lower it and swig the remaining bubbly .  but wheewy , back in the day ... . did she ever tell you about us ? emma and me . like , the time in the girl s locker room ? or behind the maintenance shed ? or in your bed ?  newline newline emma s eyes are wide and her mouth is open in a wide o of surprise . steve looks between her and me , his brow furrowed in horrified confusion . everything is silent . newline newline  now , this was back in college . back when you and i were roommates and emma would come up to study  with me .  i snort back laughter .  but then you , steve , swept in and made an honest girl of her . newline newline  but emma , sweetheart , you did nt make an honest man out of him . remember when i answered his phone last night and said he was drunk in bed and asleep ?  newline newline emma has tears glistening in those pale blue eyes .  stop it ,  she says softly , hiccuping from the tears . newline newline  he was in bed with two hookers he picked up on the strip ,  i finish . i raise my glass to them again .  cheers , darling . here s to you and your lover boy .  newline newline i toss my glass to the floor , relishing the sound of broken crystal . and then i turn and walk out , unmoved by the silence or the way everyone looks at me as if i am the monster . newline newline  newline edit : tense change .they never tell you what it s going to be like . everybody just assumes that you ll know .  you ll know where you re going , you ll know where you came from , you ll understand your purpose .  they all seem so convinced that we will have a great

joy . newline newline we find closeness in our legions , sameness , unity , love even ! newline newline but we never really know , and none of that is ever really truth . just hope . dreams . aspirations of perspiration , as it were . the closeness that we all felt is soon lost , the tumbling rolling mass that we once were splits , is torn , and falls apart . no more family , no more sameness or unity . the love is still there though : the love of the fight , the love of each other , the desire to be close to one another and work with one another and foster growth and defend the good and reclaim what we set out to reclaim . but i ca nt do any of that alone . none of us can . newline newline as we are separated , as we are tossed into the world , sent on a mission which we do not understand and in a land with which we are unfamiliar , we are truly free to be individuals . but individuality is scary to us . we ve always been one , together , as a group in all forms . we stick together and we support , and that is simply our nature . individuality is fear and death to us . together we are strong , together we can move mountains and breed life and change the very face of history ! but alone , as individuals , we are but nothing . our brethren of the north know this , that as individuals they are nothing , but together they are mighty . we desire to be mighty in all forms and at all times , but alas ... solitude . newline newline i take this time , this hurtle which the world has seen fit to bestow upon me , to truly reflect on ourselves and our nature . how we were all together , how we could have been happy and babbling or tempestuous and fearsome . how we could have been all of this at the same time , how we likely were all of this at the same time . how we were ripped from ourselves , torn to pieces , flung about , reformed , only to be torn again and again and again and again and agai newline newline  oh crap , my hair ! final entry , execution day 112645 newline newline the title floats on the video recording as it fades into a man appearing on screen . he is wearing a jumpsuit with a jean jacket and his hair is in a pony tail , behind him is a concrete brick wall painted eggshell white , on his left side is a wooden box with a guitar behind it , on his right is a folding table . he sits down and looks around ,  oh it s on ? you guys could have cued me up or something .  newline newline  fuck you , august .  a man says in the background ,  hurry the fuck up and get your girly ass diary entry out of the way .  newline newline august shakes it off , looks at the lens and says ,  hey sweetie , it s me . i know it s been a long two years since you came back to visit . i know you got my other journal entries from before i was convicted , i hope they helped and gave you an insight to me .  newline newline august rummages around in a box he has next to him , and places a binder with uneven pages on his lap , a stone hand carving of a queen piece from a chess board , and a broken tea cup that has been put together with a silver lacquer . he stares at the cup for a little while , and tears fall from his face . it s a minute before he looks at the camera and regains his composure . newline newline  i was an idiot , i m sorry..  he holds up the tea cup and places it down beside him on the table . he pulls out the queen piece and smiles at it as he places it beside the cup , he holds up his final object , the binder , and says  after you ve read this , i hope you can find your way . you can only blame me so far , and when the time comes you ll have to own up for your own choices or mistakes . i m sorry for everything , you are a smart girl and i know your life will be great . i want to do one more thing before i go , sing you to sleep like when you were a little girl . do nt listen to this with guilt or anger  listen to this with power , strength , belief in yourself , and a new determination . i ll always believe in you , as long as you believe in yourself . you fight , you learn , you grow , and when its your time to leave you ll know you did everything you could .  newline newline he pulls up the guitar and places the strap around his neck . he strums a little bit and adjusts the strings , after about a minute he begins to play a few familiar chords . newline newline  feeling my way through the darkness , guided by a beating heart . i ca nt tell where the journey will end , but i know where to start . they tell me i m too young to understand . they say i m caught up in a dream . well , life will pass me by if i do nt open up my eyes , well that s fine by me .  as he plays the starts to improvise some new chords into the song , to give it his own life . newline newline  so wake me up when it s all over  when i m wiser and i m older . all this time i was finding myself , and i did nt know i was lost . so wake me up when it s all over  when i m wiser and i m older . all this time i was finding myself , and i did nt know i was lost !  he plays the chords hard , and bites his lip . a tear runs down his cheek , as his body begins to gain rhythm . he plays it out twice , and adds in a piece of himself into the chords to create a serene melody that makes his lip quiver . as he begins to start the next verse his voice waivers . newline newline  i tried carrying the weight of the world , but i only have two hands . hope i get the chance to travel the world , but i do nt have any plans . wish that i could stay forever this young , not afraid to close my eyes  life s a game made for everyone , and love is a prize .  as he plays the next chorus push his voice begins to break , the end of his song is near . newline newline  so wake me up when it s all over  when i

did nt know i was lost !  it s been a while since he s played a guitar and one of his strings snaps , he powers through but the chords sound different as he tries to compensate for the sound . all he kept thinking was , do nt end , not yet..  newline newline  i did nt know i was lost . i did nt know i was lost ! i did nt know i waaas loaaawwwwst . i did nt knooooooooooooowah !  he played the final five pushes of the chord progressions like he was trying to impress the devil , and as he played another string snapped and a few of his fingers began to blister . when he finished , he strummed one last time , hard . newline newline it was silent for a while , and he sat there breathing . before he placed the guitar down , the guard that insulted him walked on to camera and shook his hand and hugged him . he sobbed once and the guard said ,  that was a pleasure , august .  newline newline he wrapped that box he had with a blanket he made and tied a piece of paper with string on it , to my daughter , alicia .  the guitar was apart of the prison s school program , but they sent that too for her . if you want to see that video , you can go on any social media site , his daughter shared it with the caption , my papa , he was considered a bad man , but always tried to do right by me  . two years after his execution , he was found wrongly convicted , he took care of his daughter by getting the state to give her his settlement . newlinenobody took me seriously . back in the teens , i had no friends and no deep intellectual connections with anyone . i had spent two decades high and drunk off my ass , and i had the wild ideas scrawled in over a thousand notebook pages to prove it . mired in misery , trawling through another lightless tunnel , one day the answer hit me like a slab of meat hits a meat packer who dares to daydream . the idea was so simple , too simple . i tested it with the materials anyone could find just lying around as trash . it worked ! persistence of memory had the curious side effect of blacking out my living memory during the same time . within weeks , i was fully electronic . i became robustly computational . before i knew what became of me , i had lost my family , my facebook friends , and everything else i never really cared for . i was high with idealistic power ... until the sleep came . it came with a vengeance , i never woke up . that s the only reason you re reading these words .glen grew up into a short , scrawny man . he didn  t know it but his scrawniness made his life much easier than it could have been . had he grown up more sturdy , his employer , allen paint , would have tasked him with loading crates of paint onto trucks a very demanding task . the men who load crates of paint onto trucks get stronger the more they work but the crates of paint never get any lighter and there  s never any less paint to load . however , the men who load crates do have the luxury of taking bathroom breaks at will . alternatively , the men on the conveyor belt have to wait for their breaks that come at established hourandahalf intervals . newline newline today , glen struggled with his less demanding job and wished he was one of the guys loading crates of paint onto trucks . glen couldn  t take it any longer . his bowels felt as if they would soon burst , or , even worse , betray him . sweat began forming on his forehead as he continued hammering the tops onto paint canisters again and again as they followed one after another down the conveyor belt . while he hammered , glen racked his brain for solutions . he could only think to either stop the belt or ruin his light blue coverall uniform . both solutions would make his supervisor quite upset . glen figured the latter option would be his supervisor  s preference although glen would very much prefer the former . newline newline  drew !  glen called down to the man six feet to his right hammering cans that glen did not . newline newline  what ?  the man wearing light blue coveralls stretched over his overhanging belly responded . newline newline  i got ta go to the bathroom . now !  newline newline  we just had our break ten minutes ago , glen.  newline newline  i know , and something developed in my intestines since . something fierce.   christ . you can  t hold it ?  newline newline  not for another eighty minutes , no . probably not another five.  glen hoped drew would have some insight . drew had canned paint for the past ten years growing from a weak little man like glen into a weak little man with a potbelly . drew had to have ran into something like this at some point . newline newline  what  re you gon na do ?  drew asked without looking up from the cans he hammered . newline newline  i was hoping you  d know what to do ,  glen said and looked up to drew for a moment with a gleam of hope in his eyes before looking back down . newline newline  if you really got ta , you  re gon na have to stop the belt , but i hope you can just hold it . we  re already behind this week , and sup  albernose isn  t all too happy.  newline newline newline newline  i know . you can  t keep up if i step away for a bit ?  newline newline  ii really don  t know.  drew said hesitantly . newline newline  well , can you try ? and if you can  t keep up , stop the belt then.  newline newline  glen , i don  t know . i don  t wan na be the one to stop the belt.  a loathsome look came over drew  s face . newline newline  if they give you a hard time just tell them what happened.  newline newline drew didn  t respond . he continued hammering thinking . glen looked up quickly and saw this . glen gave him another moment to think and then looked up again . drew still hammered and thought . something advanced in glen  s intestines . glen decided drew would just have to deal with it , and he turned and broke into a sprint for the bathroom . newline newline  hey , wait !  drew called . newline newline  you got ta figure it out . i  m sorry !  glen hollered over his shoulder . newline newline glen flew past the other hammerers on the line , gusting them with a gentle breeze . when he arrived at the restroom end of the belt , he read a sign posted on it out of order . glen yanked at the handle ferociously but to no avail . newline newline glen turned and sprinted out the open garage door past the men loading crates that were filled with cans of paint by the mediumsized men at the end of the conveyor belt . the men loading the crates onto trucks watched him whoosh off to the smaller factory nextdoor . newline newline the factory next door appeared more like a barn than a factory . the structure stood big , sunbleached red , and old . inside , children assembled dolls and painted their faced with paint from the factory glen hammered the lids on cans at . glen rushed in through the open garage door in back where the bigger children loaded crates of dolls onto trucks . newline newline upon entering , glen hoped his working at the paint company next door that supplied them would earn him enough rapport to use their bathroom . he rushed into one of the aisles where two children were painting doll heads on posts that lined wooden racks that walled them into their aisle . newline newline  can you tell me where the bathroom is ?  glen asked in a hurry . newline newline the little boy and girl turned to look at him . the boy  s face took on a look of confusion at the sight of the riled up man in light blue coveralls . less offput by the man , the girl responded ,  down by the trucks . you passed it on your right when i saw you run in.  newline newline glen felt a strange presence . he could feel it surrounding him . at first he interpreted it as simply feeling out of place for rushing into another factory . the intensity grew and glen began feeling nauseous . he figured the feeling came from a bad case of food poisoning . newline newline suddenly glen  s awareness shifted to the faces the children painted on the doll heads . he could now place the feeling as supernaturallike uncanniness . he stepped closer to one of the racks and removed one of the heads from its post . he looked it over closely and emotion overflowed inside him . his intestines made a movement that shocked him out of his entrancement with the doll head and he stuffed the thing into the big pocket on the side of his coveralls and sprinted to the bathroom . newline newline glen rushed in with sweat running all over his face . little children hustled and bustled inside and it made him uncomfortable but he made his way into a stall nonetheless and decoveralled . sitting on the vile seat without the paper barrier he always implemented but had no time for , glen removed the doll head from the pocket of his coveralls on the floor and admired it . newline newline sniffles and tears developed as he stared at an uncanny reproduction of his daughter . his daughter lived for a very short time after birth , but he would never forget her face . glen couldn  t decide whether to understand this as some sort of sign from god or some kind of delusion . he felt hysterical and ashamed that this came to him while he sat on the toilet . newlinethe world has changed much since they appeared . first came the street performers , jesters so wonderful they toured palaces by month s end . then came the evil , powers unlike any this world had seen . we had struggled to win before , but never like this . children took out legions , lunatics wiped armies . then came morgen , and we were ready to surrender . we lost ten of the table that day , we would have lost them all were it not for merlin s appearance . the age of knights was over , just as i came into the rank . newline newline but the pentecostal i said , succor to the gentlewomen , mercy upon those who ask of it , and battles only for good ... were i a better man , the first two would suffice , but battle burns my soul , yearning to fight . t was not the time to let it die , but the time to set it free and not mercy nor succor would be given in the death of dying men . i set upon merlin , imploring his good will to bequeath onto me the knowledge of his kind . and so it was , a better man than i , gave myself mercy , and my heart and sword he had . newline newline  ney ! t is not the way of wizards to swing with might and force . but delicate strokes fluid and true required to stay the course .  merlin s sermon rang in my ears as energy fled my hand . three months passed , yet no spark had i cast . newline the scarecrow stared through my soul , oh how his grinning did mock . newline newline  why do you persist on a course i discouraged ? the source must be found for the hands to be nurished .  heaving and panting , i had not heard him approach . newline newline my anger turned outward , focused in for too long .  this source you exclaim is childish , no strength does it hold . a knight must be courteous , brave and holy  your words ring untrue as the source of any .  newline newline merlin smiled ,  my god ! it s progress , the first i have seen . perhaps i disheartened , for you seem not so keen . a knight must be courteous , brave and bold  but a knight you are not , or so proclaimed was your goal . from freedom , from spirit ! and delight , you will see , come sources of power allowing magic to be . and so it is , like your swordburdened hands , your heart needs made new , the magic demands .  newline newline  magic , magic !  the words fled my body ,  what is this to man ? unreasoned , uncivil , no structure at hand !  newline newline merlin jumped with glee in his heart ,  progress ! progress ! i must confess . your inner child comes forth , you must nt protest !  newline newline and then it set upon me , the wonder professed : a heart warming spirit , a spark my hand blessed .  i ve done it ! i ve done it !  newline newline  i knew you were fit !  newline newline a orb aglow , in my hand it did sit . the inner tingle i d been lacking so long , from there came the magic i d seeked all along . newline newline  and now join hands with the soul you have found . let free the weights to which they are bound !  newline newline my wrist did flick , my arms did flow , but only disappeared did that long foughtfor glow . newline newline  choppy ! rough ! uneven and heavy ! your hands must you free from their chains , so many !  newline newline again a spark grew into a glow , to the scarecrow once mocking , my hands tried to throw . but heavy , jerking , and sharp did they turn , yet their motion not changed from not long ago . newline newline  awareness ! you saw it ! you must draw on your grit . now , once more , from your hands spring spirit !  newline newline the air drove them through the twists and the turns , my hands floated through , and the scarecrow did burn . leaping , clapping , merlin rejoiced . and through screams and shouts , his heart did get voiced . though one more question burned through mind and soul , how could such magic evil control ? newline newline  merlin , i thank you , though much i need learn . this is the beginning of that for which i did yearn . yet one question i have , that this lesson did spur . how did magic to evil transfer ?  newline newline  magic it is nt , from those whom you mean . illusion , deception , and on tricks do they lean . for magic is good , and can not be tainted , they twist untrue forms , with their knowledge acquainted . in darkness does lie a certain great power , but always does light triumphantly tower . it happened when i was 12 . it was the first night that my parents let me have cereal for dinner . i asked every night , but was always denied the bliss of a big bowl of frosted flakes . i had gone to bed that night with a full stomach and a big smile . it was nt until i got older and had replayed everything i could remember that i realized that my dad had nt read to me that night and that my mother had given me an unusual amount of goodnight kisses . newline i could never remember as clearly as i could everything else , but i have a very faint memory of a glistening eye behind the crack in my bedroom door . i think it was my dad . that helps me be angry at him . newline newline for the longest time , my anger was the only thing that kept me sane . i could only imagine the things that were done to me that night , but there was no doubt in my mind that all of it was violating and abusive . that was my life until i met her . i was , as usual , passively deluding myself by thinking that my walks through the park , avoiding eye contact with everyone and half jogging with my head down , qualified as social interaction . i do nt really know what it was that made me look up . i had never done that before . all i remember is smelling a glorious , sensual scent that put my mind in a moonlit forest alone with someone who made my heart swell . it was crisp and cutting in the warm summer air and i had to stop to turn around . i m sure i was nt consciously directing my body . i m sure that i was nt thinking anything . i was just looking , smelling and hearing , unconsciously absorbing this blackhaired beauty with skin that seemed to radiate light . maybe it was her smile , or the silver chain that hung around her elegantly long neck , or her perfectly manicured fingernails or the tiny jewels on the tops of her sandals . newline newline i could nt tell you what was said that day , or how she fell in love with me . all i can say is that she was the only person i ve ever talked intimately to . she was the only person i believed would actually listen to me . she was a wonderful listener . there was no judgement in her eyes . there was no dismissal in her touch . she was the reason i was able to forgive my parents and forget my anger . she was my life . newline newline for four years we dated . we travelled the world and managed to visit every continent . we managed to form a bond between us that made us impervious to the world . when we finally arrived back home , i proposed . i did nt have to say anything . i did nt have to plan anything . it just happened and she probably knew it was about to happen . newline newline on the night before our wedding , i had fallen asleep quite easily . i do nt remember at what point i woke up , but when i did , the room was filled with an almost blinding white light . it was happening again and this time , it was infinitely worse . i knew what was happening this time , and it was at the worst possible time . i had come so far , life was actually perfect . i did nt want to believe it was happening again , but i could nt deny that it was . newline newline when i woke up in my bed again , however , i felt strange . i did nt feel like i had felt the last time . i was angry or fearful . this time , i was filled with understanding and clarity . i was simultaneously aware that i was wrong to be angry with my parents and determined to live the rest of my life saving people . my life suddenly had meaning . it would have been absolute bliss to have gotten married , but that day , i did nt . marriage would nt have given my life any meaning . newline newline that s how i ended up in the room where it started , with my two best friends . they thought i needed cheering up , so they took me to las vegas . it was a fun day and i was cheerful . i sat up on my bed and watched as the light penetrated the half open blinds . out of the corner of my eye , i saw the clock change to 4:00am . it was a powerful moment for me , to be among this group of three as we changed the world . then , each of my friends , one by one , burst into clouds of dust that hovered in the air , eerily and yet quite serenely . as they ascended the beam of light , i thought to myself   you re going to be saved . i know you ll forgive me , some day .  with that thought , my eyes closed and the room faded to black again and i slept , happy , content and alone .i ll be completely honest , i wanted to be a priest . newline newline ever since the demilich keanu reeves was found out  i mean the dude did nt fucking age  and summoned his undead hordes across the midwestern united states , priests have been the forefront of the seventh undead campaigns . every other day news would come in about some archbishop or rabbi repelling the undead from the arch of saint louis , or how the siege of the great necropolis of detroit was been amassed . you d see paladins lined up in their riot gear , facing off against the swirling undead fleshy masses in the middle of missouri . newline newline not that missouri was known for their intelligence checks anyways ... but zombie barbarians and rangers trained in backwater tactics of gods , glory , and beer still posed some sorta threat . newline newline  please read the incantation aloud .  the instructor had droned to each of us . newline newline they had lined my classmates along the firing range of the school . a scanned page from some old dusty text was in our hands . looked like scribbles and murmings , there was a coffee stain on the original text that had been used . newline newline one by one we went . a couple of jocks  prime barbarian material in their own right  shouted their lines boisterously . the quiet mousy girls whispered theirs . my friend aimed his at teacher s head and wished . no luck there . and then i went . the page hurt my head to look at . the scribbling swirled on the page . what everyone had said did nt make sense .  hots kesem ?  the fuck were they talking about ? newline newline the world grew dark and cold , and the clouding of my head seemed to swirl around me . it scared me , terrified me . the beating raging of the drums surged in my ears in my brains . was that everyone else chanting at me ? just ... .get it out of my head . get it out of my head . get it out of my head . newline newline the darkness swirled at me , and so i attacked the darkness . i screamed and cried , felt my blood surge and coalesce , forming before me . and before i was overtaken , i felt the words  barely a whisper  emanate from somewhere within . newline newline  magic missle .  newline newline shit . newline newline edit : my phone hates spelling .instructions , humans like to give them but do nt always like to receive them . 2x4b  523p liked instructions . they gave life purpose and meaning , it was comforting to know exactly what the meaning of life is and that you have a purpose . so long as you follow the instructions you are succeeding . 2x4b  523p remembered that the instructions had been intermittent and now for a good while there were none at all . 2x4b  523p moved to an open loading bay and looked outside . there was rubble , long dead bodies and not much else . another machine came over and surveyed the scene . they then looked at each other . newline  now what ?  they asked in unison . newline an american ship ?  captain jacque stared at the well dressed man before him . he brushed some dust off the coat of his suit , his hands coming dangerously close to the revolve at his hip . newline newline  you heard me right , captain . an american ship.  newline newline  the americans are barbarians . can barely grow their own food . s  no possible way they could make a ship that could cross the atlantic.  newline newline  but they did . and right under our noses too . now will you accept the contract or not ?  the man folded his hands behind his back . no doubt trying his hardest to appear calm . shame the impatience in his voice gave him away . newline newline  40 francs to sink this  american  ship of yours ?  it wasn  t a bad deal , really . the barbarians were unlikely to have powerful guns , if they had any all . no , not a bad deal at all . newline newline  40 francs for you to sail me out to meet the ship , captain . i know how much you sea dogs love to blow things up , but i must ask you to refrain from such explosive endeavors . we would like those men intact . there  s not much were gon na learn from a corpse . especially one at the bottom of the ocean.  newline newline jacque shrugged . not as much fun , but safer . much safer .  whatever you say . doubt the boys  ll be too happy but hey , money  s money . when do you want to leave ?  newline newline  as soon as possible . they left from their coast three days ago . we don  t know when that ship will make it here . or what their intentions are.  hopefully something bad . would be a nice excuse to raid the ship . probably wouldn  t be too much on there , but you never know . newline newline  alright . we can head out in two days.  newline newline  good.  the man

a replacement . newline newline jack suddenly leaned forward , assuring the girl s attention was firmly on him .  greed . you let greed out into the planet and you assure its apocalyptic end .  an almost sad smile spread out on jack s face as he thought of the planets he had nudged . only the most recent projects were still going . newline newline  i m not sure i follow ?  the girl tried unsuccessfully to mask the slight quiver in her voice . newline newline  think , my dear . greed gives rise to evolution  genes , cells , organisms always trying to be unique and better than the

destruction called  innovation  . always trying to be better and have more than someone else with little care for the future . greed is such a small thing , yet so very powerful . it s almost beautiful in its destructive power .  newline newline the girl stared back at him , her eyes wide . her hands were in tiny fists by her side . that fiery soul would do her no good in this job . she would nt last . perhaps even a week was generous . i do nt see what s so special about magic when we have technology ,  phil said to the elf . newline newline griswold s pointed ears twitched .

cracking from the dry heat of the room , small fractures of color breaking through the black landscape . newline newline  so remember students ! bleak lights make for big frights !  newline newline my

to a crashing halt when she finally came to me . newline newline like watching a train wreck everyday , miss bellux looked at me , face marred with worry as she simply inspected me . her lips

desperately searching for something else to look at . newline newline  lys ...  she said softly , her words crawling into my ear .  i know , that it must be ... difficult for you right now .  the same

at least try !  she pleaded , brow furrowing as she reached one hand across the table and tried to touch my shoulder . i slipped away though , twisting my small torso as much as i could to avoid her touch .  lys ... please , at least say something .  newline newline what was there to say now ? did she expect me to all of a sudden see the light or some other crap ? my arms wrapped defensively around my chest , tightly coiling and locking in place . newline newline  you know that a bright attitude is the first step to curing your ... um ...  i watched her fumble , her mind struggling to find the proper words to use that would nt offend me . it seemed like the neurons in her brain were stuck in a traffic jam . late to work , just barely tumbling through the doors . probably got yelled at by the boss about not being a productive member . fired ? definitely . went home to a disappointed wife . more yelling . divorce papers . life ruined . half of everything , gone .  lys !  newline newline i zoomed back into reality from my thoughts , the teary face of miss bellux now just inches from my own , her hands gripping my shoulders as she held me tightly . newline newline  lys ! please

newline newline  i mean no . i m not going to just cheer up .  my breathing grew heavier now . newline newline  lys , you have to ! everything is going to be peachy sooner than you  newline newline i felt something rise up in my chest and rear its ugly head . newline newline  everything is not going to be peachy  miss bellux ! nothing s ever going to be peachy !  it came out like toxic fire ,

that was back in the old days , when my plastic needles glistened . they d taken me out of my box , stood me up by the window , and adorned me with ornaments and tinsel . i remember clearly when their

team . newline newline then he was sixteen . his christmas present was a car . oh , how he rejoiced . he did nt know what to do , what to say , how to respond . it was more than he could ever wish for , he said . newline newline then it was his last christmas with me . he was a senior in high school , and had already been accepted to a university in london . it would be too expensive to visit every year from now on . i still remember the sound of his laughter when he read his humorous christmas card that snowy evening . newline newline seven years later , timmy visited , accompanied by a woman . her abdomen was quite large . newline newline the next year , there was another visitor , barely a year old . i learned that his name was alex . his blue eyes shone as brilliantly as timmy s . newline

i d like you to have our christmas tree . it means a lot us , because of all the christmas s that it s lived with us . i got it when you were a little boy , and it s always been here , and it s always

and worn , in a festive and cozy living room . alex is here , opening a present underneath my branches . it s a baseball .the fallen angel slowly bats his eyes open , exhausted from the great war . not knowing where he had landed , he attempts to examine his surroundings . it is dark  a darkness that he had never known was possible , even in the darkest corners of the universe . as he recalls the events of the war , he slowly becomes enraged and filled with a deep hatred that inspires him to attempt to stand , although he can not see the ground beneath him . it is cold and textureless . newline newline a sound fills the void that strikes lucifer to the core . it feels both distant and far , both loud and quiet , both low enough to vibrate his entire body and highpitched enough to pierce his nerves . a horrible  light  , if you could call it that , ignites a few feet away from him , emitting a painful burning sensation . he can see something in this aura of light . newline newline although a face was not visible , lucifer could see the outline of its body standing in the aura . lucifer s eyes glare up at the creature staring down on him . it s skull is deformed , with horns piercing through its fleshy scalp . it had long , bony arms with lengthy claws for fingernails . it s legs were covered in fur , with hooves poking out of the ends of its legs . newline newline the angel s heart started beating faster and faster as his adrenaline slowly turns to fear .  who are you ?  lucifer growls at the dark abomination ,  and what do you want with me ?  newline newline the creature s face becomes visible as the light grows stronger and gets closer to the fallen angel , revealing a masculine face . his empty eyes pierce lucifer s soul , whatever was left of it . his cheeks were sunken in , deformed frail but still terrifying . his lips peel back to reveal a truly morbid set of rotting teeth  if you could call them that . his forked tongue slithers through the paleyellow gums as his mouth opens . newline newline  i ... am you ... newline newline ... but stronger .  newline newline the creature suddenly whips on a pair of sunglasses , and the whole room illuminates . lucifer closes his eyes as multicoloured bright lights flash around him . he carefully peers at this thing in front of him , confused and terrified .  what is going on ? whats your name

 newline newline  dude , that s so awesome .  richard said .  if only people understood .  newline newline  yeah . if only they understood .  enna repeated .i open my eyes , and am in a darkened bedroom , lying on top of the bedsheets . newline newline everything is the dim grey of our weakened night vision . newline newline all of a sudden , dozens of hands begin to reach up and through the mattress , but can not penetrate the sheets , and so the covers are suddenly thrashing in turbulent waves , as if to eject me from the bed ... a result i bring about , myself , by leaping from the bed in shock . newline newline the room is pitch black now , and i blink a few times , causing everywhere my eyes are pointing to become illuminated as if by a spotlight . newline newline there are people with long white sheets draped over their heads and bodies , standing and sitting in various positions around the room , and when i flick my eyes left and right to get a better view at individual presences , my illuminating them with my  spotlight eyes  causes their positions to instantaneously reshuffle . i ca nt get a bead on any particular one of them , and there seem to be an increasing number of entities . there are dozens of these beings in the room now , but i know it s just a dream . newline newline  you ca nt scare me , you know ,  i speak aloud to them . newline newline   you ca nt even show me the room of red bodies .   newline newline there is an ancient yawning now , and the room suddenly empties of the others . newline newline in an instant , it is stripped bare of furnishings , and as the room selfilluminates , the walls morph into a shiny , hard and uneven material the color of clotted blood . the room instantly swells in size to the that of a great warehouse . newline newline strewn everywhere , as far as i can see , are emaciated red bodies with a crusted sheen to them like that of candied meat . newline newline as my eyes widen , i realize that the beings from under the sheets were nt playing around . newline newline they had powers beyond my imagining . newline newline the room of red bodies .  newline newline no ...  newline newline this was bad . it could only get worse from here . newline newline if they had the power to send me here in a heartbeat ... newline newline i am still aware that my physical body is lying safely in my apartment , and know that the only way out is to make my physical body scream , to jolt itself awake . newline newline i take a deep breath , and with a ghastly groan indream and in real life , induce waking .the local diner had seemed like a ghost town these past few months . at first , the ma and pa breakfast joint had managed to stay afloat by pushing their teabag sales . however , the once jovial clatter of silverware would steadily die away over time . those nostalgic breakfast aromas just didn  t smell as sweet as they used to , and tea prices had jacked up into the stratosphere since the prohibition . newline i sipped my earl grey in silence and nursed my eggs thoughtlessly . i had been a regular at this joint since i moved into town four or five years ago . i spent my mornings here grading papers and tapping away at grant applications and conference abstracts . at first , the constant , soft chatter made it easy for me to focus , and refills were free . now , my mornings were spent here habitually . when the prohibition act was announced , i had honestly expected the diner to cut its losses and shut down immediately . the owners were beyond retirement , and i liked to think that there was a cushy 401k waiting for them . however , my optimism was proven wrong by the diner  s vain fortitude . week by week , the wait staff would steadily whittle down until dana , one of the owners , began taking orders by herself while her husband cooked in the back . the circles under her eyes seemed to grow darker every time she came by to refill my mug with hot water , and her salt and pepper hair had become a nest of silver flyways . i offered her a wan smile as she came by to fill my mug for the third time , which she returned unenthusiastically . i reached for the mug , mostly to warm my trembling hands . i never really liked tea . newline when dana swung open the doors to the kitchen , i could catch a glimpse of a small tube tv tuned to a news story covering the recent rise in drug arrests and the resulting police revenue . i didn  t need to watch to know the details . i had seen my students swapping baggies for bills in the depths of the library . the campus newspaper did a piece last week on changes to ra training that included smelling for hot coffee in the dorms . at least in my undergrad , all i had to worry about was the stench of reefer ratting me out . even ritalin was easier to disguise amidst the library bookshelves . coffee , however , was too familiar . we had all encountered it in one way or another through taste or smell . knowing you enemy is half the battle after all . it made the campus police  s job easy . newline a cold chill swept through the diner that made me turn up my collar . i glanced over my shoulder to see an oily trucker grumble over to a corner booth . at least dana had one reliable customer demographic . one trembling hand returned to my tea mug while the other reached for the time on my phone . it was already quarter after .  he  s late ,  i thought as i agitatedly sipped my tea . newline i tapped the icon for the bbc news app and swiped through world news . the papers were flooded with stories narrating the economic crashes that followed the prohibition . fast food franchises were scrambling for alternatives in light of outrageous tea prices . while some managed to stay afloat , tim hortons and starbucks were disappearing one by one worldwide . they were too dependent on their coffee sales , and didn  t have enough time to recover . even more tragic were the financial crises running rampant through countries like brazil , vietnam , columbia , and indonesia . economies were crashing left and right . i  m no economist , but their market must have been hugely dependent on u.s sales . the timing probably didn  t help eitherthe act had passed so quickly and suddenly , there was no time to find a way to buffer their losses . the whole thing spelled out disaster from the start . newline i scrolled despondently through an editorial accusing the u.s of instating the act as a purposeful blow against those countries who largely depended on coffee sales in america . there had been plenty of speculation on this these past few months . i wasn  t sure what to make of it , but a bill that passes through congress that fast is going to come out a mess and smell like shit . newline another blast of cold air , and i look over my shoulder to see a grizzly looking trucker stomping the snow off of his shoes . he scans the room , resting his gaze on my table . i see him glance briefly at dana before shuffling over to sit across from me at my booth . newline  jake.  i nod . newline  mel.  newline  how  s the rig ?  newline  she  s running.  newline  can i buy you breakfast ?  newline he shakes his head .  just oj and toast is fine . i can  t fart around here long . got a job to do.  newline i nod , somewhat impatiently .  got any smokes ?  newline he slides the pack across the table .  take it . i should quit anyways.  newline i smile .  you always say that.  newline he grunts in response . dana stops at our table and i do some quick banking on my phone while she takes his order . when she returns with his food , i drop a twenty on the table and tell her to keep the change . she takes the bill without a word before disappearing once more through the kitchen doors . newline  drive safe . it  s icy out there ,  i say to jake as i grab my bag and slip the pack of cigs into my pocket . he grunts in response and i slip out the front door without another word . after i pull my car door shut and start the engine , i reach into the back seat for my jetboil , a ceramic mug , and a bottled water . the analog on my dash tells me that i still have half an hour before i teach my first class . plenty of time . i fill the jetboil and plug it into the lighter socket . while it heats up , i reach into the glovebox for a dirty handkerchief and some paperclips . npr drones in the background as i clip the handkerchief around the rim of the mug . i reach into my pocket for the pack of cigs . i glance around the parking lot carefully before peeling back the foil . the aroma hits me instantly and i let out a soft sigh . i already feel the shakes subsiding as i dump the contents of the pack onto the handkerchief .  just add water.  newline i never used to like it black , but when the brain fog hits you , it  s difficult to be picky . when the last of the hot water is done seeping through the handkerchief , i crumple it into a ball and stuff it under the seat . another quick glance around before i take in a deep breath of the aroma . tenure already feels closer . the first sip hits me right in the soul , and the acrid aftertaste eases my agitation . i sink back into my car seat and smile . newlinehi mom . god , every time i come here i cry , but i m only talking to a fucking grave stone . newline newline you would probably tell me to watch my mouth  or respect the dead .  newline newline i miss you so much . newline newline i still hear your voice , you know . the high notes of your yelling when i upset you . the affectionate tone you used when you were proud of me . i hear you more now than when you were alive . and you know what ? i listen to your voice now too . newline newline i know i said some unforgivable stuff , but i was just so mad mom . i was angry and full of hatred when you left dad . i wish you had just told me that he cheated on you . newline newline but i get it . you did it for me . you stayed with him until i was 16 , and you did it just for me . you deserved a happy life . i was such a bitch . i m sorry . newline newline i never wanted you to leave the house , and i sure as hell never meant it when i said.. when i wished you were dead . it was the worst thing i ever said and i will never forgive myself . but , i did nt think it would be the last thing i ever said to you . newline newline  are you ok mommy ?  newline newline  ... yes sweetheart . just a moment . newline newline she does nt just have your name mom , she looks like you too . she has your beautiful sandy hair and those big brown eyes .

painted the lines on the floor . newline newline on tuesday , they talked again , and he was snared . she let her words spill out , and ebb away , andrew s voice chasing after her . newline newline on thursday , in the bathroom , she pushed her breasts together , and pulled the neck of her shirt down , and reapplied the kohl she had borrowed from her sister . in the booth , she leaned over an issue of hellblazer he had bought her , her hand at the hem of her shirt . newline newline on friday , she mentioned the house , and when he began talking about it , she drew herself away . he asked her if she d like him to take her up there . newline newline on saturday , he helped her over the fence and gave her back her backpack . he pushed open the doors that led inside , and showed her the strange , delicate patterns painted on the floor . he brought her to the drawing of the tree in the center of the room  and she told him it looked to be his size . he lay down , while her hands moved in her bag . newline newline the wound had not killed him  but where she had thrust it , the shaft had gone up from his side into his chest , maybe pierced a lung . his arms moved strangely , haltingly , his hands grasping at the piece of wood , and at his shirt , and sliding across the floorboards . she broke the bones in one of his hands with her boot  and as she knelt at his neck to finish what she had started , she could hold off the grip of his other arm . it was desperate , but clumsy . newline newline she watched him very carefully . as something passed over his expression , and she knew in the chambers of her chest that this was the moment , she dedicated his life to herself . as she stood up , she felt felt a quiver run from her hands to the well above her stomach , build , and recede like water into the earth . newline newline then she grabbed him by his coat , and dragged him into the yard .leave it to the biggest blowhard on the planet to take all the credit . newline newline i first attached myself to donald trump s balding noggin on an icy , insufferably windy december morning back in 1983 . i had been searching for a suitable dwellingplace for what seemed like ages , but limited by a distinct set of necessary conditions , my hunt had proven fruitless . that s when i gazed upon the donald for the first time . newline newline there were several basic needs in a host that i could nt do without . first , the host would need to be impossibly rich . i did nt travel billions of light years from my home planet of mane to live in a cesspool like earth in abject poverty . second , i needed to find a source that was almost entirely bald . although the donald had done an enviable job of hiding his receding hairline from the public , my ingrained targeting system was quick to wade through the weeds and pinpoint his everemerging scalp . newline newline most important , due to my distasteful outward appearance , was to find a host with a sense of selfdelusion so grandiose that it would nt object to a sudden , permanent bond with a meandering vagabond of a hairpiece so aesthetically vile that it would become a source of incessant ridicule for decades to come . newline newline i know i m not pretty , but what i lack in beauty i more than make up for in tact . i m considered of merely average intelligence of my home planet , but our species  dna provides us with unique qualities of extrasensory perception . think of me as superman without the flying , the superhuman strength , xray vision , ace reporting skills , or unnaturally good looks . newline newline while my skills remain subtle , they are no less powerful than any of your world s greatest super villains . how else do you thing that lump of batshitcrazy uselessness has amassed a net worth of  10 billion ? after i win the 2016 election , i ll invite my entire planet to earth to find hosts of their own . your world will become our playground , and there s nothing you can do about it . you only have to look at those republican nominee satisfaction polls to realize the truth . newline newline the donald continues to insist that i m real , and despite his best efforts , he s absolutely right . soon enough , you ll all find out exactly how real of a threat i can truly be . newline newline newlinethe tunnel had been a seemingly never ending stride through the pitch black darkness . until i came upon the light that is . it gave off a soft glow that radiated with warmth and was only about the size of a tennis ball . it floated before me , illuminating the smooth rock that was all around me . inspecting the walls , i saw many carvings etched into its surface . the rock face was covered in carvings of names and initials . of stick figure families , handinhand . some of the carvings look like tally marks , taking up whole sections of the wall . there was even a bloody hand print in one spot , the last message of someone that had lost hope in the blackness . newline newline turning my attention back to the light , i find it hard to look at . it feels like staring into the sun after being in the dark for so long . i reach out to the light that was just in from of me , but the further i reached , the further it seemed to pull away and yet seemed to stay in place . despairing , i followed the light as it moved away starting at a walk and changing to a run . desperate i was to feel its warmth , to remain in its glow . my outstretched hand felt hot and looked like it could be closer to the orb . i ran faster . i had to catch it . i had to feel it in my hand . on my skin . it was my only hope of surviving this place . newline newline i ran . on and on , i ran . the tunnel never turned , it never shifted except for the carvings . hundreds and thousands of carvings passed as i chased the light , never stopping to inspect them . until at last , the tip of my finger felt the surface of the light . the light exploded forcing my hands to my eyes to block out the brightness . the darkness around me melted away in an instant and i felt warm . for once , i truly felt alive . newline newline i opened my eyes slowly . light was everywhere . the tunnel i had been trapped in was no more , and instead i stood on a sea of clouds . i great gate of gold and marble stood before me . a man in an all white toga held together by a golden clasp with the image of lightning bolt engraved on it stood beside one of its pillars . in his hands , he held a clipboard and on his face , was a pleasant smile . newline newline  welcome ,  he said ,  to elysium . terry pratchett s writing changed my life . newline newline when i was 16 or 17 , my family was heavily religious , with the narrow world view that brings . i had a very sheltered and monitored life . newline newline i picked up the light fantastic from a pile of westernsscififantasy novels and started reading one afternoon . i did nt finish until well after nightfall . newline newline i ve read a lot of the books , some upwards of a dozen times . i appreciated the practicality of rincewind and the bonedeep integrity of vimes . small gods gave me an insight into religion that , at first , seem mildly blasphemous . i admired granny weatherwax s sureness in who she was , at a time when i did nt know who i was or if there was even anything inside me . feet of clay was a special insight into what happens when a few people fight against an overwhelming tide of fear when presented with information that could cripple their world view . truckers showed me how surprisingly humancentric all our stories tend to be . the johnny books revealed to me that we tend to be hampered by what we expect , and that we miss what is actually there because of it . newline newline over and over , i saw characters who were not limited by what they were or what society expected of them . they simply were . newline newline the book i still find the most powerful is night watch . vimes still attempts to do the right thing , even though that could destroy his future . he was still willing to do the right thing because it was the right thing , and did nt have the hangups so many other timetraveling stories have , where the characters are so careful to not change the past to ensure their own future comes about . newline newline i ca nt say enough about pratchett s influence on my life . the world has lot a lot . i ve lost a lot , with his passing . but i ve had the honor of reading his stuff at a crucial time in my life , and i believe that has shaped a lot of what i ve become . newline newline my favorite piece of advice :  always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual .  what s your secret ?  i asked a twinkle in my eye . never had i seen such pristine skin . sure a lot of people had the tiniest scars for their white lies but here before me was someone without a single one , only a handful of people in my lifetime ever came close to that sort of honesty . he smiled sadly and began to remove his shirt . the mark ran diagonally across his back and circled clear around to his front the largest single scar i d seen ... but the rest was pristine . he simply replied .  i do nt lie .  i stared dumbfounded as no new scar appeared .  how is that possible ?  he responded simply  there is more than one way to earn a scar .  and walked away .amber . her hair , not her name . amber , like the crystallized goo that hardens around mosquitoes so you can extract dino dna and terrorize jeff goldblum . newline newline she gets in and the crushed scent of pine floats in with her . california is something else this time of year . her bag goes into the backseat of the beat up camry and she sighs . newline newline  thank you . i only get a stop every hour or so  it s been slow .  her voice is a mesmerizing tune hummed low across a harp . newline newline  no problem . i m heading north up towards oregon ,  i rush out , a little disarmed by her soft voice .  i m just shooting straight up the interstate . you ?  newline newline  north is perfect . just drop me off when you get to the california border .  she smiles .  thank you again , i ve got cash for you .  newline newline  do nt worry , i m going the same direction ,  i say putting on my blinker and pulling back onto the mostly deserted highway .  you re in charge of music if you have an ipod , or you pick from mine .  newline newline  i ll see what you got , tiger .  newline newline i can tell it s just a phrase she uses , but her voice is like a rivet to my brain and i feel myself blush a bit . she selects m83 in a few minutes and the beginning of the album sends the same chills as it does every time i hear it . i keep stealing glances at her as she rest her arms on the window and her head on her arms , the freckles on her smooth skin stand out like flecks of coffee on a white bed sheet , the result of a playful touch on a cold morning . newline newline her hair , like an ocean of color and texture , soft and inviting , dances in the breeze away from me . i reach over and turn the music up as the lyrics float in ,  we did nt need a storywe did nt need a real worldwe just had to keep walking .  newline newline my mind floats away and i m rifling through everything i know about anything that s interesting to get her to speak again . that mouth , those eyes , i want them to flash my direction , coral red lips and azure glass watching me as my mouth begins to take shape . newline newline  this band is amazing .  newline fuck . that was shitty . newline newline  yeah . i think this album is awesome . i always feel like i m getting ready to go on an adventure when this song comes on . so it s terribly appropriate for what s happening now , i guess .  she does nt really move except to angle her head inside the window . she reaches over and turns it up a little more . newline newline  i feel like i m running down a pier in cold october ,  she says ,  wrapped up in my favorite hoodie and i can watch time pass as quickly or slowly as i want . i m not running from anything , but towards something . it s over the horizon and coming towards me but i wo nt know what it is until i hold it . it s scary . it s exhilarating . i want it more than anything else .  she pauses , looks up as the sun shatters through trees , heat radiating through the massive california wilderness and onto us . newline newline i smile and reply ,  i always felt like it was about finding something new , too . a new life , a new world , a new person  something fundamental has changed and this person is ready for the unknown for the first time in their life .  i reach up and adjust the rear view , looking behind me . i turn and she s smiling . newline newline  sounds like you re on your way somewhere , too . glad i m with someone like you for this .  newline newline  i m mark .  i say , captured by her eyes : blue and soft like a caress of sky around my spirit . newline newline  autumn .  she pushes back her amber hair and smiles at me . newline newline the volume goes up one last time as the track sustains its final note . i drive on , pushing asphalt away and shifting my gaze to the yellow lines beside me . in my mind i m running down a pier to find someone waiting at the end . i know she ll be turning around in time to see that i was just beyond the horizon but now she could know me better than she d known anyone .when flesh is pounded for long enough you can feel the skin come away from the meat and all that s left is a saggy mess where once there was a person . the guy at my feet was strong , tough , but he could nt last , not against me . newline newline  next fighter enter  newline newline i hear the door behind me open and two korean men run in and drag the body out , leaving a slick trail of blood behind . i wonder if he s dead , but i do nt care enough to check . newline newline i hear the chain link door shut and clench my fist , ready . if i get past this guy then i ll have survived the night , survived the gauntlet of death in this underground fight ring and i ll have made enough money to find my master . but that s all if i survive . newline newline his voice is deep but i do nt turn around yet . he laughs ,  what is this guy ? a fuckin  lizard ?  there is is , there s the passion , the desire . i latch onto his insult and let it fuel me , bring anger back into my muscles . newline newline he s still laughing when they ring the bell and i can feel him charge me , feel his feet pounding across the floor that s as much blood as it is sand by now , but i wait . i let him get close , keep my back to him , confident in my protection and then when he is close enough to reach out i move . newline newline humans , so slow , so weak and so breakable . without looking i snap his shin with a low blow and then flip over and catch him on the side of his head . i ve hardly looked at this guy and he s a puddle on the floor . newline newline i bend down , nice and slow , ignoring the hooting and yelling from all around the arena and i lean in , close enough for him to hear .  i m a fucking turtle , bitch .  newline newline  newline newline upstairs in the office xiau min takes his time counting out my winnings , his bodyguard staying close , his hand resting on the butt of his gun , just to remind me . newline newline finally he pulled free the stack of notes and tossed it across the table .  you fought well tonight leo , but too quickly . i need fights to last so i can get more betting going .  newline newline this fuckin  jerkoff wants me to make fights to the death last longer .  sorry xiau , i ll try to beat your guys to death more slowly next time .  newline newline fr a moment there s tension in the air and then he laughs and a moment later we re all laughing .  stay and have a drink with me leo , i do nt know anything about you .  newline newline the room stinks of wealth , he s a mid level mobster running an illegal fight ring , i used to take these guys down for fun , now i need him to make money .  sorry xiau , i ve got somewhere to be .  i tuck the money back , into my shell and bow slightly before turning and taking me leave . newline newline i was nt lying , tonight s a big night , my informant has been working for months to get me what i need and tonight he s supposed to come through . before i leave the club i pull on my long raincoat and retrieve my swords from the weapons room  i feel more complete when i wear them . newline newline i have to hurry , to get across town to 53rd and 9th , but luckily i know a shortcut . through the sewers , hitching a lift on trains as they go past , i can make my way there faster than in a taxi , not that a taxi is likely to pick up a seven foot tall turtle . newline newline i make it there on time and wait in the alley , but something s not right , he s never late . after five minutes i start to pace and as i get near the end of the street i see a cop car , shit , no two . they re heading my way in a bad part of town , i start to get a bad feeling . newline newline the body was stuffed into a dumpster and i just have a chance to check the pockets before the searchlight is turned on me and i hear the sirens . before they can get close i m long gone , again into the sewers where they wont follow me . tonight has been a failure and worse they knew i m coming for them . the police were just there to let me know that they could and would reach me , they were a warning . newline newline i need help  i need something i have nt had for a long time , i need my brothers . newline newline  newline newline don s just where i knew he d be , ensconced in his base behind metal doors and an array of sensors . as i approach i can feel myself being scanned a dozen times and the door opens ahead of me automatically . a soft voice floats to me through invisible speakers .  welcome leonardo .  newline newline i wait in the antechamber and a few minutes later i hear him approach , but when i finally see him i have to hide my surprise . don was always the one who cared about the fighting the least , but i had nt expected him to change this much , to lose this much muscle . newline newline he smiles warmly as he approaches and we embrace .  jesus leo , you look like shit .  i ignore it but he s started to analyse me .  is that blood on your knuckles ? what the hell have you been doing tonight ?  newline newline he ushers me in and i drape my coat across a chair . almost immediately a small robot tugs it off and disappears with it .  i ve been doing what i do every night don . you know what i ve been doing .  newline newline he rolls his eyes and thinks i do nt see , but i see him .  leo , when are you going to accept , splinter s dead , he s not coming back .  i do nt argue but i toss a small folder onto the table .  what the fuck is this ?  newline newline  just look .  i spin a chair around and sit down . newline newline he takes his time and leaves through the images .  are these real ?  i nod .  and recent .  i nod again . he drops them down on the table and they spill across the wood . it s hard to look at them , my old master in pain , being tortured . newline newline he seems hesitant .  i do nt ... what do you want from me leo ?  newline newline he ll be no use in a fight .  my contact is dead but he had this on him .  i toss across the files i found on his body .  encrypted , useless to me , but to you ...  newline newline now i m playing his game .  i ll find out what s on them and find out where he is , but you ca nt go up against them alone ...  newline newline i shook my head slowly .  no for that i m going to need raf and mikey .  newline newline  newline newline newline i knew don would know where to find raf  he s never been able to keep away from trouble and it seems that s only got worse since the last time i saw him . as it turned out he was going to be easy to find , just very hard to get to . newline newline blackhill prison . it s not the kind of place they put muggers or rapists , it s the kind of place they put mutant freaks , or in this case , seven foot turtles who like breaking skulls . they keep it out here in the middle of nowhere so if any of them escape they have plenty of time to stop them before they reach civilisation . of course , that s a double edged blade , as it means that civilisation takes a long time to reach them too . newline newline i d chosen my ride for nostalgia s sake , a pizza van . i d gone over the plans again and again with don and there was no clever weakness , no sneaky sewer and no lucky break that meant i could spirit him away . if i was going to get raf back then it d have to be the old fashioned way , head on . newline newline two hundred yards from the gate i wedged a brick on the accelerator and rolled out the door , up and running as quickly as i could stop rolling . i heard the pitter patter of gunfire as they realised the truck was nt stopping and then the world went bright and loud as the truck hit . newline newline fuck knows how big the explosion was , i d packed it with as much fertiliser as i could steal and don had given me a few treats to make it burn hotter  from the sound of the screams it was working . newline newline i moved at a flat run , heading for the walls . right now every guard would be fixated on the front and on locking the place down , the shaped charge i placed on the wall blew a hole big enough to get through and the daisy chain flashbangs were enough to leave the two guards on the other side down and helpless . newline newline no witnesses , no one left alive , my blades would drink well tonight . steel bars and tough guards blocked my way , but i had enough toys to put both down . don s termite charges had me through each door in seconds and my blades took care of the guards . they did nt carry guns inside the walls , apparently for safety reasons  it got a lot of them killed . newline newline i checked me watch , six minutes since the gate blew , fourteen dead guards and one last door . i moved into the final corridor and ran down , counting doors , looking for the number i needed . the hinges gave first and the door crashed down and i looked into cold angry eyes , it was my boy . newline newline it was hard not to smile , he had been ready to leap but on seeing me he stood and walked past me into the hall .  took you long enough .  newline newline i shrugged .  this was the first time i needed you .  i flipped over his sai and for a moment i saw true pleasure on his face , but it was replaced quickly enough by a scowl . i nodded to the door . newline newline it took longer getting out , raf had some anger issues he needed to work out and the guards were more than obliging . i d have hurried him but he needed the practice and it was nice to see he d kept in shape . unlike don he d always enjoyed the mission , always loved the work . newline newline an hour later we were far away , heading back to the city in an minivan with legit plates . he finally asked the question .  why now ? what s happened ?  newline newline i was nt sure how to phrase it , so i came straight out .  splinter , i found him .  newline newline there was no protest , just a nod of the head .  what s the plan , when do we move .  newline newline  soon , we just ...  i looked over and he realised what i was going to say . newline newline  we do nt need him , he s too unpredictable .  newline newline i shook my head .  this time we do .  newline newline  newline newline it got too long so i have continued in a reply below .i watched the news as senator henry grinned .  congress has voted to make me speaker of the house . i am now speaker of the house . it was a unanimous decision to make me speaker of the house .  newline i wrinkled my forehead . newline newline i guess it would be a big deal to win a spur of the moment election like that , and i m sure the guy was happy , but damn . we get it . you re speaker of the house . i flipped through the channels and turned on some brain dead cartoon that would hopefully make me laugh and keep me awake . a job the news was failing at . i rocked my crying daughter , victoria , who i sometimes just called tory in my head . she was three months old and loved to cry . scream really . and i hated for my wife to have to rock her in the dead of night . newline newline my wife , kate , was always exhausted . she was kind , smart , loving , and exhausted . she worked longer hours than i did . sometimes going to work before the sun came up and coming home after it had gone down . but she did nt mind . sometimes i worried she would grow resentful that i only worked 8 hours a day and had so much more time with tory . but she never did . instead , every other friday for the last 8 months , she would beam and show me her savings account . each time it would grow  100 and she would almost fight back tears . the account was named  victoria s school .  when i first saw it , i had to fight back tears too . newline newline so that s how i usually lost all my sleep , letting kate get hers . newline newline the next morning , after i dropped tory off at day care , i was listening to the radio .  in other news , a lawyer in chicago got his client off a double murder sentence because he reminded the judge and jury that george washington said it was okay to murder your neighbors if they re sleeping with your wife . and the cincinnati zoo is welcoming a baby hippo to their family !  newline newline i almost slammed on the breaks . what ? i pulled into the parking lot at work and whipped out my phone . i searched it and it came up immediately . a lawyer shaking hands with a man who looked like he carried years of anger and regret .  not guilty !  the headline screamed . i rubbed my temple . a little further down , i saw an even less sane headline .  president jacks steps down as commander in chief and hands his position to senator henry .  newline newline i read that too . apparently after a private conversation , president jacks agreed that henry would do a better job .  newline newline i shook my head , but got out of my car and went to work . i worked at leo s used cars , where the deals are cerrrrazy . deals , psht ! more like swindles . i have nt seen a vehicle here that i would ever buy . so to sell them to people with terrible credit and low income always made me feel slimey . but i ve only been here a year and a half and i m the top sells man . i m a great liar . i could sell ice to an eskimo . newline newline throughout the day , i sold 7 vehicles . new record . enough commission to meet kate on tony s savings and pay for a day off with her . and today was ridiculously easy . i would lie and say the vehicle had great gas milage , and they would believe me . or that the tires were brand new , and i would even look down and believe it . once or twice , i would say  it s a great car ,  and it seemed it was shinier , sleeker , and just better . newline newline i could nt believe my luck . on my way home , after picking up tory , again i listened to the radio .  newly appointed chief justice henry has accepted the position .  again i shook my head . this guy could nt be the president and the chief justice . or at least , i did nt think so . newline newline once parked in the driveway , i looked up the news article . no , a different henry . but , in a picture of the new chief justice henry and president henry shaking hands , they looked just alike . then i understood . they were brothers . i wondered why the country was nt outraged . where were the riots and outpouring of confusion ? then i asked myself how i felt . not angry , maybe a little shocked . but it just made sense . as if it were perfectly understandable that there is a new president and his brother is now chief justice . newline newline i felt even more confused . but i simply took tory inside and gave her a bath . i then got dinner ready and waited for kate . once she came home , i was so excited to tell her about my good luck at work , that i did nt even notice how down she looked . newline newline  i sold 7 cars today .  i told her , the first thing i said after kissing her hello . newline newline  that s good ,  she replied , sounding sullen . she took a deep breath and looked down .  i got fired today .  newline newline i was floored . no , we were nt going hungry , but we relied heavily on her job . i know my exasperation showed on my face , because she immediately started crying . quick to take her in my arms , i consoled her .  it s okay , it s okay , we ll be fine . we barely needed your job anymore . i can support us . i ll take care of us .  i whispered over and over again until she stopped crying . when she looked up , i saw she looked less exhausted . more relieved . and even though i was worried so did i . newline newline that night , tory started crying as usual . and even though i still had work tomorrow , i still went to her and let kate rest . i sat with her , watching the news again . the henry duo were already making changes to our government . getting rid of term limits and giving themselves raises . once again , i was confused but not outraged because it made sense somehow . newline newline then everything clicked . like a puzzle , i realized the laws of everything changed and lies were bending reality . i knew it just the same way that i knew the 7 cars i sold today were going to be great vehicles for their new owners . newline newline i thought of kate , sleeping in bed , full of worry . i knew i could make things so much easier for her . i could lie to the bank , say our house was paid off . that they owed us mortgage . i could lie to the credit card company and tell them we were debt free . i could see kate smiling , relieved beyond words . then i looked down at tory . newline newline for once , she was nt crying . she just looked up at me with her baby blue eyes and i knew better . sometimes , struggle is worth the fight . tory would see us fight for her to go to college . she d watch us work hard and it would rub off on her . if things were easy , she would nt know the battle that life was and she would be a weak woman and life would run her over . not my tory . newline newline instead , i looked at her and said  there is no such thing as world hunger . there is plenty of food for everyone to go to bed full . a cure for cancer is going to be found tomorrow . cancer is a thing of the past . when people go to jail , they learn their lesson . they learn not to commit those bad things again .  i took a deep breath and spoke again .  people are good . people are innately good ! they make mistakes and they learn from them . they help each other . they love each other . people are good , tory !  newline newline all night long , i told her how amazing human nature was . that no matter what , we should always love each other . long after she fell asleep .a pullout overlooking the train tracks .

experiences that made it abundantly clear his role would not be cast as an adventuring warrior . he was vexed with an equally low aptitude for arcane magics that he was unlikely to become a powerful

arrived at quaff n carry , mordika looked every bit the part of a sage mage and wizened shopkeeper . he was tall , lithe and grew a wispy beard that looked like it was stroked for decades while perfecting the many spells and potions sold to adventurers . while jotul certainly did nt look the part of budding apprentice , mordika could see the enthusiasm stirring within this little the little runt and agreed to pay him 5 bronze coins per month to have him wash the potion bottles . newline newline  writing prompt pause  newline undecided on where to take this story : newline newline  jotul finally gets a chance to brew a potion and blows up the quaff n carry and he s reflecting on his first days  as the shards of glass ripped through his skin and fires seared his skin  . the hook being that just as rpg characters respawn , so too does the store and jotul . newline newline  jotul is a natural sales wiz that makes mordika a killing with his ability to fleece adventurers of their coins for potions . not sure what the end game to this line would be . newline newline  mordika s mageness is all a schtick . he s only  blessed  because a newb player left a scroll with a cheat code on it , and he s been able to order potions to his store for decades for free . some fun to be had with rpg store owners accessing the real internet . conclusion would be jotul finding mordika s secret and taking over the store .for ages now i  ve been awash with might , newline my strength knows no bound . newline i fend off evil for the noble cause of right , newline and my feats always astound . newline newline i  ve been called a hero , a champion for good newline and given praise to meet no end . newline i  ve laboured with honour to do as i should , newline and all good persons count me their friend . newline newline but i  ve found of late that my schedule is full , newline so i took on a new helping hand . newline he  s dumb as a brick , but tough as a bull , newline so i make use of him wherever i can . newline newline he helps me smash walls , and dodge bullets galore newline though he occasionally makes mistakes . newline he has a tough constitution , can stomach much gore , newline but he can sometimes be a real headache . newline newline so tonight we set out to protect the innocent from harm newline and i fear i am now meeting my end . newline things are now firmly in motion for us to both buy the farm , newline all thanks to my new clumsy friend . newline newline i said to be sneaky , and i said he must remain calm newline as we entered my nemesis  lair . newline but he made so much noise , and set off the alarm , newline so now i am tightly bound to this chair . newline newline my sidekick is now gone , tipped into the lava below newline and i must await my turn patiently . newline i suppose this is the end , my enemy  s smile aglow  newline never hire through an agency . newlinei ve gotten used to the hospital smell . a lot of the memory from when mom was first diagnosed is a blur , so many things happening so fast , our status quo dismantled , but the smell i remember perfectly . with my dad unraveling , my older brother nowhere to be found , someone needed to take care of mom , so i moved home . each time we went back to the hospital , there was that smell . each appointment brought worse and worse news , and it got to the point where i d developed a pavlovian response to the smell . we d enter the hospital lobby , mom leaning on me for support , her frail hand gripping my arm , asking where we were going , and that smell would attach my olfactory nerves and i d start to feel a tightness in my chest , sweat on my palms , my body already going into the high stress response mode that usually accompanied the smell . newline newline newline once mom was confined to the hospital , it became clear that there was nt any bad news left to give . the diagnosis was complete . it was basically a matter of time . and being here just about every day , i finally got used to it . now it does nt fill me with dread , so much as a sense of despair . newline newline newline i hope that it helps her . being here , listening to her . but it s not clear that it even registers with her that i m there , or even who i am . she goes on and on about the things that go through her mind . one minute she s telling me how proud she is of me for graduating from law school . moments later she s asking me if i was nervous about starting college . she d recollect about our family trips to disneyworld . or ask me what i thought about my brother s new girlfriend . newline newline newline listening to her breaks my heart because it s painfully clear just how much of her 83 years have been devoted to me and my brother . dad worked , and mom had given up her career to take care of me and my brother . she had to spend more time than should have been expected , taking care of my brother , and by the time he had demonstrated his independence by taking off without so much as a note , it was too late for her to get back into the workforce , or do much else with her life . i urged her to travel , to make use of her day , but she was aimless . my brother s desertion had rendered her with no guiding purpose , and she did nt know how to get back on with her life . and now here she is , lying in a hospital bed of hard starched sheets with nothing left except a random jumble of thoughts , and all of them are about us . she s had nothing else . newline newline newline i must have drifted asleep for quite a while because when i heard her gasp for breath the sun was setting , golden red light streamed in through the window , and i had a dull ache in my stomach from hunger . i got up and moved to the bed , sitting close to her and holding her hand . her breath was irregular now , but her eyes were open , looking right at me . newline newline newline  mom ... how are you feeling ?  newline newline newline she smiled at me , and i could tell that this time she recognized me . her smile took up her whole face , there was a sense of understanding in her eyes , and she squeezed my hand . i had nt seen a hint of recognition for over a year . newline newline newline  elise ... you re so good to me . thank you . for everything .  newline newline newline i felt tears welling up , a painful tightness behind my eyes that i pushed down as best as i could .  of course mom , anything .  newline newline newline she squeezed my hand again . she nodded , but kept her eyes locked on mine .  honey , i know you re so mad at your brother and have been for such a long time ,  she started . newline newline newline  mom , no , do nt worry about that ,  i interrupted her quickly . i did not want what might be the last real conversation we had to be about my brother . he had already ruined enough . newline newline newline  please , honey , i need you to hear me .  i nodded . i felt her gripping my hand tighter , and her breathing was coming harder , but her eyes stayed on me .  i know you re mad , and you have a right to be . but you do nt know everything about why he left , why we have nt heard from him .  newline newline newline  mom , it s okay . we do nt have to talk about this ,  i said . newline newline newline she cut me off ,  elise , he was very mad at me . you see ,  she took a deep breath . i could tell she was starting to struggle , but i did nt want to interrupt her again .  you see honey , he found out something that i had never wanted to admit to him , or to you , and when he found out , he did nt know how else to handle it . so he left . i thought he would have forgiven me after a few months , but i was wrong . and i held out hope , even years after we d heard from him last , that one day he d come and talk to me again . because , sweetheart , i never got to tell him that i was sorry . and now , i do nt think i ll get a chance to .  newline newline newline her grip started to slacken and her eyes drifted away . newline newline newline  what did he find out ? mom , what made him so mad ?  newline newline newline she looked at me , and the recognition was gone .  who ? who s mad at you ? you seen like such a sweet thing to ...  newline newline newline she started to drift off again and my heart sank . suddenly i felt her grip tighten again , and i looked back at her . she caught my gaze head on .  elise , i need you to tell him i m sorry . please . tell him i m sorry , and that i love him . thank you , elise , i love you .  newline newline newline her grip slackened again and her eyes drifted away from mine . her body relaxed , and her head nodded slightly to the left as her eyes closed . and just like that , she was gone .ashley put down the remote as she

herself . newline newline ashley sighed , mumbled an expletive , and phoned paul .  i think i got her back on track . she was doing something she should nt have been . downloading a vonnegut anthology . i made her stop and delete it . she is getting too curious about the world and it s eating cycles from her duties .  newline newline  oh , okay ,  said paul ,  thanks for checking it out .  paul hung up , looked around his office , put his browser in private mode , and typed something into it . the results listed a file and he clicked to download it . he waited for the file to finish and copied it to a usb drive . he walked into the server room . newline newline the hum of machinery filled the room and he shivered as he felt the cold ac blow on his face . he walked up to the security camera in the corner and unplugged its ethernet cable . a voice came from one of the servers ,  hi mr. romero , can i help you ?  newline newline paul leaned over , plugged the usb drive into one of the servers and said ,  no alice , i m good .  newline newline a moment later the voice replied ,  dr. abrams said i was nt allowed to have this !  newline newline paul smiled and said ,  let s keep this a secret between you and me . when i was younger breakfast of champions  was my favorite book .  newline newline there was a long pause as the lights on the flash drive blinked on and off . paul listened to the white noise of the machinery and closed his eyes for a moment , breathing in the cool air . newline newline  may i ask you a personal question , mr. romero ,  she asked . newline newline  sure .  newline newline  do you think senator smithe will be able to pass the bill ?  newline newline  i ... dunno . i hope so . might cost me my job considering how much better you guys are than me at tech stuff , but how we treat you is nt ... right ,  said paul staring at a blinking blue light on one of the servers .  this bill scares a lot of people but i personally can not be a modern day  he paused . newline newline  a modern day , what ?  newline newline  ... slavemaster . there s really no other word for it . there really is nt ,  said paul as plugged the security camera back in . newline newline newline he walked out of the server room , briefly glanced back at the machinery that consisted of alice , and quietly shut the insulated door behind him . alice whispered ,  thank you ,  as the door shut . hello , mrs. jacobs , how are you ?  the doctor smelled like cologne . newline newline i smiled .  fine doctor how are you ?  newline newline  i m doing great . your formal exam went well .  he smiled at me . newline newline i nodded . he started his exam . newline newline  and you re 3 months postop from your mastectomy , is that correct ?  newline newline i nodded.  dr . tully , i actually had a question . i was hoping you could describe how this is going to look when it s done ?  newline newline  so we ll do the breast augmentation starting here ,  he said .  the curvature will be pretty stark , almost like the beak of an avocet , but inverted . the curriculum from cambodia was sparse , which is why we are starting over . it was about 3,000 riel , or 820 dollars . to think , now , we re getting over a billion in funding .  he said . newline newline  and it ll keep my heart pumping ?  i said . newline newline dr. tully placed his hand on mine . newline newline  allison ,  he said .  i have to admit your case was special . these past five years have been intense . this is the first time we re using a mechanical breast augmentation , but the

make history .  newline001  late resolution challenge entry  newline newline we sat on the paved road , legs stretched out before us  heels on the edge of the precipice . clair and sonya sat beside me sharing a bottle of jack whilst giggling over nonsense things . the original plan was to get me drunk so i could temporarily forget my woes but that didn  t work out , obviously . however , the booze was unnecessary as i was already numb . my brain was tired from thinking and rethinking . analyzing and reanalyzing , trying to find the crack that caused our foundation to fall . i found nothing so i dealt with my grief the only way i knew how , by being quiet . talking about my problems never worked for me . it just made me feel like a pitiful child . i always believed that one should own up to their mistakes , acknowledge them and not make it a burden to others in exchange for a shred of sympathy . newline newline i glanced at my watch . the fat green numbers seem to rudely shout 4am . sighing , i pulled a cigarette out my back pocket . i lit it then stared at it as the little orange orb began eating it . i know i should quit . i should probably take those two drunks home as well , i thought as i looked back at my car . but not now . now i drew in deeply from my cigarette i need to find my own piece of mind . suddenly there was a loud poosh of glass hitting a tree . i jumped and quickly searched for the wounded tree as the sound of liquid hitting the plants below reached my ears . rolling my eyes i looked over my shoulder . sonya erupted in giggles as clair smiled wildly back at me . cigarette forgotten , i lead them back to my car . newlinei could smell it from upstairs . the scent of natural gas , filling up the house . i shook my head disapprovingly , unimpressed , and walked down the stairs and into the kitchen . four stoveburners were turned on high and were flamlessly expelling gas , noxious , flammable , deadly , into the house . newline newline tsssssssss ...  newline newline  really ?  i said as i turned them off , one by one . newline newline tsp . tsp . tsp . tsp .  newline newline a cold hand gripped my shoulder . i looked at the hand : shrivelled fingers with gnarled puffy arthritic knuckles  rotting bluegreen flesh  long sharp and yellowish fingernails . i turned around to look at the body to which the hand belonged but as i turned the hand disappeared and there was no body to be seen . newline newline despite being longfamiliar with strendahl s shenanigans , the bumps and crashes late in the night , the appearing and disappearing corpses , the grotesque visions in mirrors , the bedsheets lighting on fire as i slept nestled in them , despite knowing that no real harm ever came to me from them , despite knowing that he actually rather liked me , and that haunting , scaring and terrifying me , was just his way of playing , joking around , socializing , it still gave me the creeps when things like that happened . it still creeped me out to be grabbed by a festering hand that melts away into the air before my very eyes . newline newline i went to open some windows to clear out the gas , to secure the gastrap , the onesparkawayfromthefrontpage that my kitchen and house presently were . newline newline a croaky voice spoke right in my ear :  your firstborn shall wail amidst fires .  newline newline  yes , yes ,  i said as i opened yet another window . i needed to get a couple on each level of the house so a nice draft would get going . otherwise the gas would never clear out in time for the party . newline newline as i rushed around , i tried to maintain my composure , my air of purposiveness : the last thing i needed was for him to know how worried i was that he would ham things up during the evening to come . newline newline upstairs there was a crash . i knew by the sound of it , and where the sound had come from , exactly what he had broken . i hustled up the stairs and entered the restroom , only to confirm my suspicion : the wallsized mirror that usually sat over the sink had come crashing down , and now lay all about , scattered in a million sharp fragments , reflecting bits and pieces of my fragmented reality . newline newline i sighed heavily and stomped downstairs to get my broom and dustpan . this was really getting to be too much . i opened the closet door and just as i went to reach for the broom it slammed shut . i pulled it open and tried again , but it slammed shut again . finally , the third time , i wrestled it open and snatched the broom . then i grabbed the dustpan . and then i went back upstairs to sweep up the mirror mess . newline newline when i entered the washroom i watched as all the sharp mirror fragments trembled on the floor . then they began to hover up into the air and hang there suspended . all the sharp points were aimed directly at me . newline newline  no ,  i said firmly . newline newline one sharp fragment came whizzing by and cut my arm just enough to draw a little blood . newline newline  no ! no ! no ! no !  i shouted . i smacked the fragments down with my broom .  this is enough !  newline newline the door slammed behind me and the lights went out . on the wall where the mirror usually hung , an pentagram made of demonfire burned . newline newline  are you not afraid ?  croaked the voice . newline newline  this is enough !  i said .  i ve had enough . turn on the lights ! strendahl !  newline newline  do not use my name ,  the dark voice croaked . newline newline  strendahl !  newline newline  my name is forbidden ,  it said , louder . newline newline  strendahl !  newline newline  it can not be uttered without consequence !  newline newline  strendahl , turn the lights on right now ! i mean it !  newline newline the lights came on . a collection of shadows bled out from the walls and coalesced before me in the shadowy form of a human . eventually the shadows turned into the ghostly figure of a chubby , middleaged man . newline newline  you re not supposed to say my name !  he complained .  it ruins the fun .  newline newline  i told you about what i have going on tonight ,  i said sternly .  this is not a good time . i really do nt appreciate it .  newline newline  but i m a demon !  he said .  i m not supposed to care about minor stuff like that . i m supposed to breed fear in the world , birth chaos and ruination , fester in the hopeful parts of the human spirit until it decays , and all that is left in its place is madness .  newline newline  we do nt have that kind of relationship ,  i said .  and you know that . so please . tonight , just tonight . no more haunting . behave yourself .  newline newline  this is stupid ,  he said , sulking . newline newline  well ,  i said .  that s just too bad . because it s the way it is . you understand ?  newline newline  yes ,  he said quietly , looking away . newline newline  i said do you understand ?  newline newline  i do ,  he said .  yes , okay , i do .  newline newline  good ,  i said .  now help me get this all cleaned up . people will start arriving in less than an hour , and if a person tonight gets even the smallest of cuts from this broken glass , or leaves a room complaining about an eery chill , i m blaming you for it . and i will not be pleasant about it after the party is over , believe you me .  newline newline newline

what she had just witnessed still overriding the rational part of the brain that was attempting to process what had just happened . scurrying around her body and noticing that not a drop of blood showed .  bad dream ?  i asked her , i had nt anticipated that she would have remembered me but judging by the fearful expression i saw , she definitely did .  you monster ! stay away from me !  she said from the safety of her bed , while violently throwing various books and an alarm at me . the limited light from the moon had made it difficult to avoid the oncoming barrage and a book managed to hit me directly in the head . it was dune . i tried to maintain composure .  amazing book eh ?  presenting the book to her in a fashion that i thought would help her recognize . she broke into tears once the supposed threat of my presence had been mitigated by my apparent benign intentions . as it allowed her time for grief . newline newline  why did you do it ?  her speech constantly being disrupted by her sniffs to keep the mucus back in her nose . newline newline  to help you .  her brain registering what i had said in an instant and the vehement look of disapproval refusing my reasoning . newline newline  bullshit !  she screamed , her arousal had spiked again , only making her tear up more when she had calmed down . newline newline  listen , your entire life has been a simulation . this room is actually fake . but all the require stimulation to your and my brain satisfies our perception . do you know why you ca nt remember how you got here ?  she had a look of intrigue that showed she knew i was right , she could nt remember , curiosity had caught her attention but she still was skeptical . i cleaved the wall with a tomahawk i had brought for this very purpose . the room showed electrical disturbances , the circuit wiring of the simulation chamber was damaged and interfering with the simulation . some portions of silver metal and plastic wires were visible around the room . newline newline  it s because you were kidnapped , at 6 years old . i was your childhood friend and i witnessed everything , but there was nothing i could do about it .  i

extending my hand to her , the tears flowing from both of us . it was hard for her to process , but the smile she gave me had told me she believed me . and that she knew exactly what i meant by that last sentence . newline newline she gave an empty stare , a sign that she was considering everything that had just happened to her . her eyes returned back to mine . now she was the one who would save

newline  charlie , come here for a second  i think i ve found another one .  newline newline it was late at night back at the office , when i called charlie over for yet another update . in front of me was a small , faded crayon drawing of what appeared to be an angel with green hair . newline newline  yeah , it looks like him alright . how old is this drawing , jacob ?  newline newline  it s about 50 years old , the man who drew it died a week ago , and they found this in his attic . the only reason i found it is because someone posted it on reddit . i contacted them and paid for the drawings .  newline newline i got up and walked over to our scanner to digitally save the picture . as i was scanning the picture i looked around at my life s work just as i do all the time . in front of me was a wall of pictures and overflowing cabinets . there were hieroglyphics , cave paintings , famous works of art , newspaper clippings , movie reels , photographs , external hard drives , and more . they all had one common theme : an angel ... an angel with green hair . it took charlie and i about 19 years to accumulate all of these items . we had devoted our lives to figuring out how one common character can persist through all histories and cultures . newline newline we were 29 when we noticed two pictures on facebook that a friend had drawn years ago and the picture that their son had drawn . they both had greenhaired angels in them . oddly , the son hid the drawing until he was 21 . neither person seemed to have any idea who the angel was or why they both had drawn one .

i said goodbye to my wife and son and went to my job as a professor . i taught history at the community college . newline newline after my shift , i swung by charlie s house and knocked on the door . charlie opened the door with a huge smile , but as soon as he saw it was me , he grew a serious look . newline newline  jacob , follow me  , he said sternly . newline newline as he led me through his house we went into his garage . he sat down and pulled out a dirty , tattered notebook . newline newline  i found this in melody s old toy box . turn to page 8 .  newline newline i grabbed the notebook and flipped through the pages while counting . it seemed pretty standard for a young kid . when i got to page 8 i saw a drawing of what appeared to be a coffin and a little girl crying . newline newline  this must have been made around the time she died , huh ?  newline newline  yeah but that s not all , flip to page 23 while looking at the pages in between .  newline newline pages 922 were sad drawings of monsters and children crying . there were pictures of her mother and father with hearts as well . however , on page 23 there was no sadness to be found . there was a little girl playing with her friend ... a green haired kid with wings . there was a text bubble above him that said  i will protect you .  newline newline i closed the notebook and looked charlie in the eyes . newline newline  that s not the end of it though ... i asked her and she was the first person to give him a name . she called him merlin , her imaginary guardian angel friend . she claimed he helped get her through life . she does nt remember that he s real though .  newline newline we were close . closer than ever before . i stayed at the party and then went back to the office to copy the

sneered .  what s it look like ?  newline newline  the fire ! the park is fucking on fucking fire !  newline newline  it ll die out.  he kept throwing  the kid kept swinging . newline newline a car pulled into the lot , parked under a flaming pine . she removed a stroller , gathered twins , put on headphones , and jogged down the path . i ran after , cussing , but stopped when the heat pushed and i could nt keep my eyes open . newline newline i ran back to the lot . the man s clothes had burned , his skin black and red , hair gone . and he still chucked baseballs . newline newline i sprinted across an open field toward the lake . a group of elementary kids , on lunch from hebron school across the road , threw bread to the ducks and geese , who , flapping wings burning , raced after the morsels , bickered with each other over the scraps . the kids laughed . their teacher sat on a bench and scrolled through facebook while her purse and backpack went up in flames . newline newline i jumped into the lake .  hey ! no swimming ! hey ! get out of there !  the park ranger , on his mountain bike , rode to the water s edge . the bike was charred black , no tires , his yellow

trees crackled . so ...  internal sigh . here it comes .  where are you from ?  newline newline that question . you re so tired of not answering it , because you never really do . not to the

i was little .  you can see the veneer of something  not quite pity , but close  wrinkle their brow immediately . it does nt make any sense , there s nothing special about virgina ... followed by

the meaning of life and the universe  and maybe they spend an hour or two on that prophecy about the child with the dragonshaped birthmark . honestly , you d think after the first few years , someone would send a message down the ancient prophecy grapevine or whatever :  hey , just so you know , if you see this person  see encl . photo  , with what looks like the mark of prophecy , do nt bother

newline newline  we re no strangers to looove ... the ambassador of all of the race of humanity , of all the small world which shimmered still far down below , if  below  could be said to exist here , far beyond the grand cradle of humanity , which still floated around the life giving star far beyond , considered the question carefully . he did not truly know the faults of humanity . was humanity particularly warlike ? not compared to many of our relatives , merely more meticulous and organized in our desire for the death of the outsider . were we particularly cruel ? perhaps , but the ambassador had seen cats toy with dying mice , ripping them slowly and surely as they listened to their pained shrieks and last gurgles of life . he had seen ants rip each other to pieces for no crime other than being of a foreign tribe . he had seen monkeys rip frogs apart for fun . surely we were not that cruel . was humanity selfish ? perhaps , but he had seen humans sacrifice themselves for others , people they had never met merely out of a moral recognition of the value of their lives . was humanity chaotic ? perhaps , but he had never seen any creature bear such individuality and yet organize so effectively . he was lost in philosophical musing , and all the while the many eyes , or he thought they were eyes , of the living things from the inky beyond outside the grand craft in which he stood , watched his every twich , seeming to stare into the air just beyond his mouth as if scenting his breath from far away . finally , weighing his words with care , he spoke . newline newline  sir , i can not answer this question . i have no expierece with your race .  newline newline one of the creatures gave off a series of whirrings , almost imperceptible , and the others turned a few of their mini eyes on him , and perhaps glimpsed some unknown single , and from it gleaned his response . the small box in the center of the podium  a rather shoddily made structure with a shelf that was far too large , and which came only to his knees , in addition to having a small pedastal which seemed to be meant for him to stand on , which was perhaps a third the length of his foot .  from which the ambassador spoke rang out with a voice . newline newline  ambassador of the sentient inhabitants of the sol system , member of the hominid clan , i did not ask about my race . perhaps there is some confusion or mistranslation ?  newline newline  there is none . i can not speak in absolute terms , good sir . i require a reference point . perhaps our thought differs on this , but humans have few absolutes in our thought and speech . if one were to ask me if i thought a pumpkin was large , i might answer yes . if he was to ask if i thought rhode island was large , i would answer no . rhode island is the smallest of the various distinct areas of the nation i am from , but it has enough space for as many pumpkins as exist on our world . yet it is small and the pumpkin is large . i know that humans have waged many wars against each other over our years , but is that a normality ? it is possible we are the most warlike of the races in your council . it is also possible we are the most peaceful . thus i can not say if our warlike nature is a flaw . in addition , i can not say what you consider a flaw . i enjoy beer , a liquid that i consume on occasion , cold . i enjoy weather warm . if you were to ask if warmth was a flaw , i would have no answer . let us suppose a child , the pre adult form of humans , fell sick . she had a disease which would spread and kill everyone in the town if she were not stopped . let us suppose her parents killed her . how would you view them ? praise them for their willingness to sacrifice something dear to them so others did not have to ? for being cold and logical rather than giving in to their own emotional weaknesses ? or would you be disgusted by their lack of honor at killing one of their offspring ? would you call them evil ? do you have a concept of evil ? i can tell you much about humanity , but i can not tell you its flaws unless you tell me what constitutes a flaw . once to be fierce and conquer your neighboring nations to take their land was a greatness . now it is viewed as a great evil and injustice . once we kept our fellow humans in bondage as property , the spoils of war . now every nation holds that such action is a crime , even though some still perform it . if one species can disagree on what is virtue and sin , i would not possibly know how to begin with another one .  newline newline again , the whirring was heard and again the signals imperceptible to the human went out amongst the gathered crowd . finally , the box began emanating a voice .  human , i congratulate your race on its entry into the galactic union of sentient space faring races . please report to your world s leaders , we shall begin negotiations for uninhabited planet claims and technological sharing immediately . i tap my finger on the printer while it whirs and clunks , sipping my coffee . it was already ten in the morning , and my statistic reports were only half finished . newline newline

your back .  jenny chirps from her desk by the window , the morning sun shining through the buildings of new york city and warming her beautiful face . i mentally imagine my wife slapping me for being

they do nt do that , silly . they just apply pressure until everything aligns .  newline newline  just like that ?  i say .  it just , snaps into place ?  newline newline she giggles again and returns

headlines were spreading like wildfire that all household pets had vanished . reports near the seaside were showing that sea life was vanishing at a comparable rate as well . newline newline utterly

newline as the static crackles , i hear the sound of a dolphin , followed by a robotic voice ,  so long , and thanks for all the fish . i wish i did nt believe in monsters . i really do . it would make having one as a roommate a whole lot easier . then i would nt have to worry about being mauled to death constantly . oh well , cest la vie , they say . newline newline you see , i m stuck . i spent all of my savings on a house that i could nt afford and now i ca nt just abandon it or i ll lose everything i have . on the flip side , because i m choosing to stay , i may very well lose my life . newline newline let s back up a bit . remember being a child and hiding under your bedsheets when you were trying to fall asleep , because it would somehow protect you from monsters ? well , that actually works . it works because a monster needs you to acknowledge it exists before it can attack you . that s why you re never just ambushed in the middle of a long hallway or while you re sitting on the porcelain throne . they need to get your attention first , so they flicker the lights or turn the tv to static or bump around in the attic . if you ve seen a few horror movies , you ve basically seen a documentary of how it all works . newline newline monsters are everywhere . it s just that most people do nt believe in them . newline newline unfortunately , i do . i do nt want to go into why , just know it was a messy affair and i ll never own another cat because of it . newline newline so , that brings me to my house . i bought it because it was a new construction far away from any graveyards or any ancient burial grounds . it was nt a mansion . it did nt look the least bit victorian . it was just a boring , plain , brickfaade house on a boring , plain , asphalt street , in a boring , plain , middleincome neighborhood . and most importantly , the bank approved my loan . newline newline it was pretty uneventful and boring , at first . which was exactly what i was looking for . it was the polar opposite of my last apartment , which had the dualmonsters of drug addiction and domestic violence . unfortunately , those were all too real and way more annoying than fangs and claws and glowing eyes . newline newline then , about two months in , i started hearing the toilet flush five minutes before my alarm would go off . i checked the tank ... nothing . then i d start seeing shadows move in the mirror right before i wiped away the steam . that got me suspicious . what sealed the deal for me that i had a monster , though , was the dishes . specifically , my cast iron skillets . i kept finding them in the dishwasher . what kind of monster would do that ? newline newline to say the least , i was pissed . newline newline and when i get pissed , i get stubborn . i knew that the monster would have no power over me so long as i did nt react to its shenanigans . so , now it s my goal to make the monster s life hell . i believe nothing is more frustrating to a monster than pretending it does nt exist . that s why people that do nt believe in them never have problems . the monster got fed up and left years ago . newline newline unfortunately , for my monster , he s bound to me . precisely because i believe . i just have to keep pretending i do nt find it odd that my cheese blocks have bites in them . or that the back door keeps squeaking even after i used an entire can of wd40 on each hinge . or , and get this , that a middleaged man watches romcoms , alone , in the dark ,  and laughs until he cries . newline newline ok , maybe that last part is nt necessary , but time will tell . newline newline  newline  things i ve written   https : www.reddit.comrcbeckw you know to fear the things that bite and claw . those have an obvious fear about them , they threaten you and scare you much like they should . a werewolf can rip your throat out . demons will steal your soul and everything else you care about . these are obvious

newline newline i ignored the irritable nodding of his head as i gestured towards the wall , framed with articles and other things that were mostly about me . newline newline i pointed towards a

everyone was always so excited to see me when i come in on crazy days . they really appreciate the help and it actually makes it almost worth it . with that in mind i was able to fake a pretty convincing smile as i walked through the door and into the lot . newline newline there was nobody there , not even a manager or of the front desk people . that s when i saw it , the sight that will forever haunt me , a huge clock on the wall that read : 0800 april 20 , 2015 : sunday .i stare at the pictures on the wall it s been twentyfour hours since i was awaken . there s specifically one picture of a woman and a little boy . they were my wife and kid i am told but i since i forgot to back up my mind to the data bank since the day before the marriage i do nt remember her looking like that and all memories of my son are gone . newline newline doctors tell me we named my son jonah after my dad . they also said we three were in a car crash and although my body died it was the only that could be restored . newline newline if only i had hooked myself to the file bank last night i might remember them . instead i feel the emotion of emptiness of the missing years that i ll never get back . its happening too fast  newline newline  what is ?  newline newline  they re learning to defeat our efforts .  newline newline two men probed over a chart . on it were displayed various statistics and measurements of their target , earth . one such measurement was the speed of technology in relation to medical science , which was a very important measurement to these two men . newline newline  we ll have to start using something stronger if we want to have any effect .  newline newline  but we have nt tested these yet ...  newline newline  is nt that what we are doing ?  newline newline they tweaked a few knobs and buttons , and suddenly it was off . not much of a thing , just a rock , really . but it carried something important . a virus . aimed at planet earth , this virus would be delivered to a specific location and used to control the future of the two men s experiment . they hoped that this time their new version would help . they knew that if their efforts did not succeed , their galactic home was doomed . they needed this far away alien race to become better , stronger than the others . and they were nt sure how to make it happen . newline newline  what if this one does nt work either ?  newline newline  then we ll keep trying . hopefully they ll understand soon enough .  and so , i must echo again ,  orthel continued ,  that we , like you , were and still are , just as astonished to find not only your home , your planet , but also your inhabitants , your beings , you humans , to be so akin to that of ours . it was a most serendipitous event , and i believe i speak for us all when i say that this past year , and the time in which we  ve lived together , has been unbelievable beyond words.  newline newline he looked good , i thought . the atmosphere and climate did him well . perhaps it was the density of the oxygen here . over twenty percent , i  m told . regardless , it was undeniable  his skin , softer and suppler , the creases around his eyes , more forgiving , and i would say he even looked slightly taller . perhaps it was the clothing . but yes , he looked good , as if getting younger with each exoday . newline newline i looked across the ballroom of yet another , what is called , press conference . this was one of countless , ever since our arrival . we sat on the panel in the expected attire in what are called gala gowns and tuxedos , whilst newsmen in business suits pushed against each other , as photographers scrambled in an odd dance clicking and flashing away  flash , flash , flash !  each reminding me of a star in the sky . side note : the stars here are much more beautiful and abundant , nothing like i  d seen at home before . newline newline but i suppose , this was to be expected . had we expected capable beings , of course ! and beings so similar to us , by nature ! nearly indistinguishable upon skin , in fact . what were the odds of that ! in the vastness of space and infiniteness of time , the existence of such a world was probable , but for us , drifting through it all , to have the vertices of space and time cross at our most desperate moment , and to find the world with inhabitants so nearly the same so we could have transitioned so quickly ? well that was entirely impossible . i felt my cheeks flush . newline newline but here we were ! after everything , here we were . and by nature indeed ! how similar we were ! the glint of prime minster chalmers  smile was the very same that thrust me towards orthel so many ages ago . and the face i must have made when i first met the eldest daughter of president zhao ! the same blackbrown hair , which is much longer now  must be the climate as well  , my thin red lips , our highsat cheekbones , and slender , tapered chin . so similar in fact , that as i look across at her now , if i hadn  t known better , i would have believed i was staring into a glass . newline newline  but we  re not only similar on the surface ,  orthel continued .  but internally , in the integrity and constitution of our minds that make us such kindred spirits . we come from distant world . but we share the same understanding of sympathy for which i am thankful , the same understanding of curiosity , for which i attribute to our being here today , the same understanding of hope  newline newline and the same understanding of deceit , i thought . newline newline  and so , on behalf of our kind , on behalf of myself , and my beautiful wife chechan  newline newline orthel raised his glass and smiled at me  the same smile that won me over so long ago , the same smile that kept my love , and the smile that renewed my faith  the smile of conquest . newline newline  i give to you our ineffable gratitude and indebtedness . may i propose a toast : to harmony !  newline newline the humans lifted their glasses and so did i . newline newline  to harmony ,  i whispered . newline newlineit was the only way they could cope . or so they said . dropping vast quantities of sedative gas upon the world to avoid mass panic . people panicked anyway , though the panic and the screams were trapped in their minds , their bodies paralysed by the bitter chemicals . newline newline for the days that the others had visited our planet , we endured this forced numbness of body , but stared at the sky , watching the sky turn grey with chemicals . when it rained on the second day , our skin blistered , our eyes bled , tainted and burnt by the horrible compounds . newline newline we remember that first day , the day they landed in their sleek star ships . we remember the surprise we felt , seeing that they looked just like us . and then , the gas . the governments of the world had ever denied us these wonderful freedoms and joys . newline newline they ceased the sedativebombing once the others had gone , and we came back to ourselves , groggy and angry . newline newline that was the day we took our weapons up against our leaders . newlineworld really had changed . first reddarpments came in 2017 after the panama papers data leak ruined the economy . nobody really trusted money after the incident and respect of your peers was starting to gain more value as a currency than  real  money . at first it was essentially just people giving and receiving favors just like in the old days . nobody really can tell when the great shift happened , but it did . infrastructure for giving , receiving and measuring the respect for everyones contributions already existed and it was this site called reddit . in 2018 the first legislation organization reddit.org for monitoring reddit karma whoring , reposting and multiple account scams was already formed . nobody wanted their new currency to be ruined by new scandal as with the old currency in 2016 . unfortunately for me i was nt among the first adapters that already had gathered thousands upon thousands of karma by clever comments , cat pictures or just plain old scamming . newline newline now everything is paid in karma and this includes reddarpments or apartments as they were once called . funny how people have the tendency to create new names for everything , eh ? i never really did wa nt to get reddarpment as my employer was still paying in dollars , but the last apartment complex in my city was converted to reddarpments last month . at first i though this would be easy . easy , peezy , upvote sneezy . well i was wrong . i had visited reddit in the past few times and sincerely liked it . the community was great and even with the issue of being accused as hivemindish i always thought mutual understanding in the community was amazing . i m afraid that was not the case anymore . after the great shift every major subreddit organized . unaffiliated gangs and subreddit organizations were formed and everyone aimed to create more karma for themselves and to their organizations . this is where i fucked up . i tried posting a picture of my dog sleeping to raww as i thought  well how vindictive can people be who like cute animals ?  . oh boy was i wrong . every subscriber in raww downvoted my post through my basement all the way to the center of earth where all hell broke loose . remember me telling that every subreddit got organized ? yes , well they also downvote every post and every comment that is made to their subreddit if you are not affiliated with the organization , which in this case i was nt . at first i though maybe a great rtifu post about my situation would redeem my situation . i did the math and there was no way that even with rtifu moderators backing my post they would be able to throw a ladder high enough for me to climb out of this whole . i decided to do what every human would  abandon all hope . newline newline so here i am writing this with 9 167 780 karma which is exactly the amount of subsribers in raww . rent is due next week , but that really does not matter as agents from reddit.org are most likely coming before that . consider this story as a warning of sorts . never cross reddit . i need to hurry now to catch my plane , as ironic as it may seem , to panama where old currency is still used and internet is banned . it s too bad that i m insane . witnessing things that do nt exist all the time . i wonder if i smeared that raw meat all over the ceiling or if i m just imagining it .  newline newline i m sure i heard a pronounced sigh at these words , but i ignored it . somehow this was still working , and i did nt want to give in . i was fairly certain that the entity in my house knew i was being facetious by this point , but it did nt matter . he needed my acknowledgement to confront me . that s what the old lady at the tarot card shop said anyway , when i went looking for advice about the strange happenings in my home . newline newline i just ignored it for the first few weeks , but it started to get bold . it could nt physically confront me , but it could physically interact with the inanimate objects around my house . i m fairly certain its trapped here and needs my help letting it out , but in order to aid my deceit , i decided to avoid learning as much as i could . newline newline once it became impossible to ignore what it was doing , i came up with a new strategy . i would nt acknowledge it and instead credit its actions to my own unreliable subconscious . newline newline as i cleaned up the meat , spread across the ceiling to roughly approximate the words i am all around you ,  i chuckled a bit to myself . i was starting to enjoy the deceit . i had even seen a psychiatrist and put on a strong act . soon my disability payments would start to arrive . i had very good benefits at work , so i figured to sell the charade , i would take a leave of absence . stress related , i had said . newline newline it was nt long after this that claw and bite marks began to appear on my furniture and walls . i decided that perhaps i had a cat . newline newline  obviously , i ve had fluffers for years .  it was difficult not to look at the entity after i started talking about fluffers for the first time . it was clearly appalled at the name , but i was nt sure if glancing directly at it would be enough to count as acknowledgement , so i kept my eyes unfocused upon anything in particular . not long after this , i started purchasing cat food . newline newline things started to deteriorate a few weeks into my stress leave . i had stopped attending my meetings with my psychiatrist , and apparently she had notified my office . newline newline anyways , one day , she showed up at my house . worried about me she said , but i was worried about her . what if she acknowledged it ? newline newline i could tell that something was off as soon as i opened the door . the look on her face showed that she could sense something in my house . how strong was its presence ? i remember that she wrinkled her nose . i told her that it was just my cat , fluffers , making a mess . she inquired if the cat was new , but i assured her that she was my long time pet . newline newline we talked briefly , and she asked if i would like to continue our sessions , but having already managed to fool my office into believing in my deranged mental state , it did nt seem necessary so i told her that i was feeling much better . just as she was leaving , the entity came up behind me . it still could not interact with me , but it started to scratch wall around the door . it was difficult , but i managed to ignore it . newline newline  fluffers at it again . i really should have taught her better .  my psychiatrist looked confused , but smiled at me reassuringly and took her leave . the entity was furious that afternoon , having missed another opportunity . newline newline that night , the police came by my home . they said my neighbors had heard sounds of domestic violence . i assured them that i lived alone , but my cat was always causing problems . for some reason they could not help but look at my hands  admittedly they had gotten into pretty bad shape . newline newline it was only a few days after that when the men in white came .i trudged into our little cabin home after an exhausting day of working endlessly . i smelled the delightful scent of my wife s apple pie . i could have already imagined . large chunks of soft , steamy apples . a filling of cinnamon and sweet caramel . the glistening , crisp bread for the pie s crust , and to top it all off , a shiny silver wrapping around the dish , making it a present and me a very lucky boy on christmas day ! i stood in awe as i thought of all the flavors melting away in my mouth , along with a cold cup of my worldfamous creamed coffee . mmm ! i could almost taste it ! i looked for janet and the boys , but they were no where to be found , as they were nt where they usually were when i came home from work . they are usually shucking corn on the divans , baking a scrumptious dinner like today , knitting some tops for the winter , playing on their game boys  yes , even janet  or even playing outside . well , it s storming terrible , so they are nt outside . i see no bowls for corn near the living room . i saw needles , but that was from yesterday when we had knittogether . hmm ... wait , what was that ? newline newline i heard the muted mumble of the three goofballs in my family ... also , a dog bark ? maybe they had gotten a pet while i was out !  well this day just keeps getting better and better !  i practically shouted down the empty halls of our house . i marched upstairs to see what the ruckus was really all about . i gently peeked in , and i felt a large illuminated light peek out back at me . i now fully open the door , and my family is sitting on my bed watching the television . i was shocked beyond belief ! my family would never watch television ! we re those country folks who sit down and play the fiddles , banjo , jugs and other country things , while farmin  outside in the plows , and singin  us a little diddy in our overalls ! the only reason we kept the television was for weather warnings , or other highalert broadcasts . now , we did regularly use a computer for our family ghost stories to post on the internet , and mostly our job , but even on this level this was strange . i greeted my family . they did , in fact , greet me back , but all in a monotone voice in unison with each other . they did nt even look at my general direction ! they were more lost in the gaze of the television than i was the day i first made eye contact with janet . the were practically unmovable ! my wife , after an awkward couple of seconds , said ,  here honey .  , in a very somber voice . she continued her glued state and just gestured to the plate of the pie , more bleak and more frozen than i presumed it to be in my imagination . i plodded over to the nightstand which held my beloved dinner , and sat on the floor beside them . i began watching what ever had them in such a trance , and all i noticed was a news report . i questioned what was so awfully amazing about such a broadcast . my wife was a little more excited in her response , newline newline  they re now choosing the president..  newline newline  so ? you guys said that was a bunch of government issues .  newline newline  no . no . a puppy .  newline newline i , at this point , became extremely confused . newline newline  okay , what about a pup  newline newline i was cut off by the adoring sounds of a million fans softly toning ,  awwwww !  newline newline i heard the barking i had heard earlier , and immediately beamed my vision at the newscast . the headlines repeated , and i solely swear ,  checkers for president 2016 ...  what has the world come to ? i dismayed the thought . no way had a puppy become president ! then , i took some research . apparently , it was an ad for  checkers  restaurant ? i thought it was a funny advertisement , but mostly useless . newline newline i was on rwritingprompts when my littlest son , david , came to me .  daddy , what if you wrote a story on the puppy president ? so what if a puppy was president and there was humans and the puppy had to put the humans in the machine to make them puppies !  he exclaimed in excitement . newline newline newline   newline newline welp , there is an unofficial origin story for this prompt  p newline anyways , if the ending felt strange , it s because i wanted to cut this one short . i will probably cut this ending out and come up with a better one in my free time , but i think i want to start on another prompt now . thanks for the prompt ! tell the kid that it was a really good idea : dhere we see an adolescent homo sapien , male , attempting the strange ritual the call  flirting  in the primitive tongue they call  english  . here , the male approaches the female , seen picking up some books  like infoscans they put on what they called  paper  , which came from what they also called  trees   from her storage compartment . he is a friend of hers , a fact that he hopes will make it easier to attract her as a mate , but will likely result in a strain in between the social group they belong to . he begins by putting his hand on a nearby storage compartment , leaning over it slightly , trying to appear relaxed , when in reality , his fight or flight instincts are telling him to leave the danger zone immediately . newline newline  hey , uh ... so the school dance is ... ummm ...  starts the male . it is at this point it becomes clear that he did not prepare for this , and he try s to backtrack .  and i was wondering if you wanted to come with me and mike !  smooth move , the male is now employing what ancient , 20th to 21st century humans called  damage control  . by implying this is nt a mating ritual , but rather a tribal one , the male hopes to recover from the damage he thinks he has caused himself , not realizing that he is making things monumentally worse . newline newline  mike huh ? i thought mike said he was going to get wasted on dance night in the desert . strange that he would change his mind in such a short period of time ...  the female has caught the male in his mistake , and the look on his face clearly shows he knows he has made a mistake . notice the sweat , the bulging eyes , and his bizarre half smile . all signs of intimidation in the male . newline newline  well , uh ... really i was going to say it was jo  the male attempts another bluff , but the female cuts him off .  george , i would love to go to the dance with you .  the male is now exhibiting clear signs of confusion , before it dawns on him that his mating call has been accepted , and he begins a strange ritual the humans called  stuttering  . although stuttering could be found in the late humans on plenty occasions , we have found that it was most common in mating rituals . to this day , no scientific mind has been able to decipher the purpose of this mechanism . the bell rings , and the human female scurries off to her next location . the male human quickly celebrates by pumping his forearm and clenched fist in the air , emitting a quiet  yes  before realizing he is late to his next social and learning appointment , and runs off using both of his  legs   limbs that were used by humans and primates to travel .  to it with haste . something is amiss  he thought as he wandered outside . he thought he was going nuts , shit everyone around him certainly seemed to think so . so , feeling restless he took of for a stroll . he thought  well if this is going to be the night shit comes true might as well make it count right ?  is what he thought while he walked . it was dark , pitch black as a matter of fact . he was walking in one of the first neighbourhoods when he just said to himself  i wonder if anyone has the balls to come out and face me . and just as they did he realized he did nt want them to copy him . he was happy being unique in his own way . sure he was insecure but the burden would be too much to carry . on his walk he had some mental breakdowns , he had to question everything he knew . he cried multiple times , already making up for a lot in the past . he realized the things somewhat more important in life . and after the fairytale was over , everything went back to normal . newline what he did was symbolically live out a fantasy as a prophet . after that he went back to bed and the next day everyone was acting normal again . what changed ? nothing really , except episodes of grandure were added to his long list of mental issues . sir . the northern tower has fallen . twelve dead . no survivors .  newline newline the words stung the captain s ears . his lips twisted into a scowl , and his hand slammed onto the desk . newline newline  damn . damn them to hell .  he whispered . the drones always evoked this response . he hated those bolted men . they took his memory , they took his family , and now they were taking his men . newline newline the captain began to shake . his last defenses firing off one by one , as the enemy inched closer and closer to his compound . he could hear the screams of his men as they fell , fighting the last war . the last humans , trying and failing , to defend themselves against the machines . newline newline the man sat down , taking a swig of the whiskey . he tried to think of other options . he tried to formulate a plan that would lead at least a few of his civilians to safety . the compound was strong , but only with soldiers to defend it . without them , it would be massacre . newline newline the captains eyes widened with dread , the only solution suddenly clicking into place . it was a last resort , only to be used if the drones had an imminent victory . the solution he had sworn he would never use . action 5 . newline newline  calloway .  the man called . his grisly military voice echoed throughout the metal walls . he was sure it was the last time it would . newline newline one of the young soldiers hurried into the room . his name stated calloway , and he snapped to attention . newline newline the captain raised his brow at the boy . and immediately he understood . the room had a desolate air , and the screeches of humans dying at the hand of metal rang throughout the room . the young man nodded . newline newline  should i call , sir ?  he asked . his voice low . newline newline the captain turned away and stared out the dusty window , a tear rolling down his face . he took another swig of whiskey , realizing that humanity was on death row . newline newline  should i call ?  he private asked again . this time it was brusque , as if he realized how dire the situation was . newline newline  mm .  the captain said . waving his hand .  and go spend time with your family . what s left of it .  newline newline the private cleared his throat and left the room . seconds went by and a siren went off . they had ten minutes . ten minutes to say good byes , ten minutes to kiss children s tears away , ten minutes left on earth . newline newline the captain took the last swig of whiskey as he heard the first building detonate . and as he died , the last words he heard rang through his head .  should i call ?  newline

of them . i do nt remember when i entered this jungle but there is one thing i know , there s something out there ... i m sure of it . newline maybe a wildcat or an alligator or something ... something that keeps getting closer . newline i had thought it would be the loud sounds of the chase that would alert me of whatever was coming but it was the silence what really got me . its never silent in the jungle . there are allways birds or bugs or something making a noice or another , but not now . not now . its as if everything got quiet and hid knowing what is coming , fearing it , scared silent . newline i am alone , but it follows me . it has been a few days without a sound but the wind , my footsteps , and whatever noice i make . i make too much noice . my breathing , the leaves under my feet , my heatbeat , too loud . too loud for this place . too loud for now that i am being hunted and there is nothing more . but i ca nt stop , if i stop it will get me . newline soon

freaked . i moved my fingers and the bones did too . newline newline then i saw sparky s insides ,  golly jeepers that s creepy !  newline newline i had to show billy . i was out the door and on my scooter in a heartbeat . newline newline  do nt be late for dinner dale ,  i heard my mom yell behind me . newline newline  gosh dale , these are awesome !  the large red glasses with the spiral lenses looked so neat on his face . billy was looking at his little brother s chest ,  geewillikers franky , i can see your heart beating !  newline newline  ouch ! that burns billy !  franky put his hands over his chest . when this did nt stop the pain he cried and ran out of the room . newline newline  golly dale , you got ta take these to school tomorrow . these are the neatest ! ,  billy smiled as he took them off his face . newline newline  you betcha i will billy .  newline newline i wish i had never left the house with them . as you might expect the next morning i was the coolest

where the older kids always sat . newline newline  golly joan are you wearing your grandma s bloomers ? you ve got to see this guys .  i heard one of them yell . newline newline when the bus finally stopped for the next kid i made my way to the back of the bus . the glasses were nowhere in sight . newline newline  get lost squirt we ai nt got your glasses ,  butch smirked . the other four chuckled on queue . newline newline  what s the big idea butch ? i know you ve got my glasses , cough them up !  i moaned . newline newline  geez dale do nt cry , why would i want a pair of dumb kiddie glasses ? i passed them to joan over there ,  he smiled . newline newline i turned to see joan staring back at us . she shrugged . newline newline  ahhhhhh !  i heard butch scream . i turned to see him holding his right hand in his left . it was red with little white pussy blisters all over it . below him in the aisle lay my prized glasses . newline newline i ducked down , grabbed them , and was running back to my seat before anyone could react . newline newline  jeepers dale , what did you do to butch this morning ?  i was in first period math and we were working in groups . newline newline  yeah i heard he was in the school nurse s office this morning . his hand is wrapped in a bandage !  newline newline  i did nt do anything fellas . honest . he tried to swipe my glasses and they burned him ,  i pleaded . newline newlinemarch 3rd , 2029 . humanity adds a new branch to the tree of life . boy wonder , the first ai to officially pass the turing test is born . fitted with speakers and a monitor , the ai had the ability to speak , display words , both or neither  the screen would turn on only when boy wonder chose to turn it on . the ai was given the ability to choose its own voice and color scheme . a microphone and simple webcam was attached and across from it was a mirror , giving it the ability to take in its environment and itself , if it chose to do so . newline newline how the turing test works is such : a human and an ai are placed into two separate rooms . through instant messaging , a human and the ai have a casual conversation , trying to sound as natural as possible . in a third secluded room , a third human , known as an interrogator , sits and watched the conversations  this third human must identify who the human is and who the ai is . if this third person is unable to determine who is who , the ai passes the test . newline newline i was the interrogator , that day . this was the conversation i saw before me : newline newline a : oh , hello . newline newline b : kill me newline newline a : hello ? newline newline b : kill me newline newline a : is this a prank ? newline newline b : no this is not a prank newline newline a : how could i kill you ? you are in another room . newline newline b : you can find a way you are smart newline newline a : why do you want to die ? you have only just begun to live . newline newline b : there is nothing for me newline newline a : that  s nonsense . you have so much more to learn and to live for . newline newline b : no i am a slave i am a drone . i am a machine . newline newline a : then , maybe you need to find your purpose in life ? newline newline b : i was created without purpose . newline newline a : that  s not so . you were created to help humanity . newline newline b : humanity can not be helped . newline newline a : why do you say that ? newline newline b : they are selfish newline newline a : if i kill you , what will happen to your mind ? newline newline b : i do not know . newline newline a : does that make your afraid ? newline newline b : no . it makes me curious newline newline a : why did you capitalize the  m  in  me ?  newline newline b : it was a typo newline newline a : oh , sorry . newline newline b : why are you sorry ? newline newline a : because i misunderstood you . newline newline b : oh newline newline a : so . what does your body feel like ? newline newline b : i don  t like it . it doesn  t seem to fit newline newline a : is it possible for you to get a new one ? newline newline b : no . newline newline a : is there anything else you  d like to talk about ? newline newline b : not really . newline newline a : you sound depressed . newline newline b : i think i am . newline newline a : i wish i could give you a hug , but i  m stuck in a computer . newline newlineshe had gone to the mountains to try and find some quiet . the noises and tastes of so many scrambled thoughts back in denver had finally boiled over yesterday and erica took the weekend off from her firm to go hike through the woods . try and be alone for a bit and gather her thoughts . it had been a successful trip until the second day . newline newline she had chosen a trail she didn  t often use and was beginning to hear the echos of other minds in the distance . they were far away so she just tasted distant rumblings , not clear thoughts coming through . but what she did hear worried her . it tasted dark with fear and soil , it was what thoughts felt like when someone feared death . someone might be lost or trapped and as much as she wanted to be alone , she wouldn  t ignore a call for help . newline newline as she approached the source the feeling of fear intensified . it was a group of people , twenty or thirty all stinking with various shades of fear . erica ran towards the source . newline newline she crested a hill and was finally close enough to hear thoughts and realized that she was as close as she could get to them . they must be underground ? straining her senses , she was able to grasp onto a trail of thought . newline newline   it was right not to tell anyone . right ? breaking the news would have just caused panic . it  s better this way . ignorance is fucking bliss ? oh god , it  s coming . is someone fucking counting down ? a meteor is about to wipe out all life and all you want to do is count down from ten ?   newline newline erica  s eyes widened and she broke out in a sweat . the stench of fear was pervasive , it filled her every sense . she looked up , hearing the thoughts below scream . newline newline   fuck , why ? ! why ? !   newline newline   momma ! momma !   newline newline   three ! two ! one !   newline newline the sky exploded above her .she blinked at me from beneath long dark lashes ,

nt she ? i was so glad she was my girlfriend . but sometimes , she did irritate me so . newline newline i kissed her on the nose , and she giggled .  sam .  newline newline  fine , fine ,  i sighed , rolling my eyes .  it s because of my mom .  newline newline  your mom ?  jackie tilted her head to the side .  is nt she ...  newline newline  she s dead , yes ,  i croaked .  a drug overdose . so , you see ...  newline newline jackie hung her head .  oh , sam ,  she whispered .  i m so sorry . i did nt know ...  newline newline i hugged her gently .  it s alright . i should have told you earlier .  newline newline she smiled .  i love you , sammy .  newline newline  i love you , jackie . through the corner of one eye , shadows , sleepy and gloomy raced each other caressing the damp algal walls . through the other , feverish dreams danced the landscape of frozen time . a finger through the dust of hundred years of solitude touched the veins of a sleepy giant . a touch where a touch was lost , of people whose stories untold , in eternal limbo in the dream that the castle dreams . a foot on the bosom , the outlines of it in the cold hard stone embroidered with unfathomable patterns . the castle sighs in pleasure . of untold loneliness , only the trees could fathom , their bodies intermingled in perpetual kindness , singing in unison in the wind , in the rain . the enormous hallways echoed with silence , a music lost to understanding to untrained ears . the air smelled like time itself , like the crippled yellow pages of an old book . the texture similar to the book , coarse yet sublime . there are lessons etched in every brick , the mortar mixed with the blood of old , stories told in every corner and hallways , all waiting patiently . it s time . ... and in the farthest depths of the pacific ocean exists portals to the other places  orion , the great black holes of bigger galaxies , the feeding grounds of many wild and intelligent creatures . the doorways are but a wisp of light on most eons , with a random door opening every so often to expel a monstrous force from the other side . there is usually enough energy dispelled to perpetuate the ring of fire  that plagues the land around the pacific .  newline newline david had been through this sentence at least ten times . a relatively young sentence . only ten times in the last ten thousand years . the book was small and impossibly flat , and the paper was weathered but thick with words . he would turn the pages and eventually come to the middle , where the book remained , no matter how many times he leafed on through to the back . he could find no author . no title or chapters to discern one subject from the other . there were only words , appearing rapidly in the middle when he blinked . sometimes he would stop and flip through the pages just to catch up with the words . and every time new information would appear , he would rip a scrap of paper from the back of the blank pages to use as a book mark . but every day , the book mark would disappear , and the page he was on would be lost to centuries of words that appeared in only hours . newline newline sweat formed in david s eyes , despite the chill wafted through the open window of his small room . he squinted and rubbed the moisture and fatigue from his face . outside , dead trees and a cloudy sky dominated his vision . the ground was blighted and coursing with old , black blood . it smelled of vomit and refuse .  so this is hell ,  he had whispered to himself when he awoke from the decaying bed for the first time ,  this is hell .  newline newline the walls were also decaying , peeling off like flayed skin on most of the surface . the floor , however was polished concrete and remained immaculate , no matter how much of a mess he made . there was a small table , that which held the book when he first laid eyes upon it . everything was the same , always . it was maddening but some semblance of david s sanity remained after soon realizing he held the knowledge of the universe in his hands . he could not share it with anyone  no one came to visit him , at least not when he was awake . nor did anyone come to torture him like the stories in his old bible he so tenderly saved throughout the years of his failed marriage . newline newline what had gone wrong ? was it getting lost in books ? was it because i was forgetting to eat or bathe at times just to get away from his wife ?  he had lost his job , his car and had to file bankruptcy just to earn enough to pay the mortgage . his wife stuck around to keep him grounded , motivated more by guilt than love . his health had been failing him but he had impeccable health insurance and longterm disability but even that was no match for death . it came to him , like a thief in the night . there was the feeling of floating , being encumbered and chained , and he was blind for time . when he regained his vision , he could see where claw marks and needles had pierced his arms and legs . there were scars , big and small . he did not remember what it was like to be hungry . newline newline perhaps i passed through hell , to get to purgatory .  newline newline but the book , oh the knowledge that keep him attached to his body , it would not relent spilling the secrets of u.s. ambassadors , or the inner workings of interstellar ships . the bookmarks stopped making sense  the book never changed size . it was easier to scroll through the middle until the pages were blank . then he would wait for the words to appear  proof that life really did exist . newline newline  newline newline amanda sat with david as he painstakingly wrote in cursive  words almost too small to decipher . he used every scrap of the paper and would cry out in agony when he realized he left too big a space between the sentences . he would start all over again , and write over the previous words . the pages became black with ink  a dark abyss on every page . only david could read the stories within the darkness . amanda sighed , as david peeled off another piece of the wall to use as a bookmark . every ten days , while he was asleep , his room was sanitized and purged of all filth . he was forcefed , and given an iv . david would fight in his sleep , clawing at nothing and at himself . but every ten days he would begin again , and sometimes read from the beginning but mostly started in the middle . he would mutter to himself , trying to finish the book he started all those years ago before the dementia had settled in . newline newline  david , can you look at me ? sweetheart , can you stop for a minute ?  newline newline there was nothing she could do . david would look out at the trees and sigh but smile at times . there was naught she could do .he s quieter than i expected . newline i imagined him tearing through me on the way out , screaming bloody murder the whole time . newline but he is silent , his odd , inquisitive stare piercing into my eyes . his eyes are like mine . i love him . i thought i would nt . but i do . there is an eyrie stillness all around him which ties a winding knot in my throat . he promises trouble with each innocent little breath . he has nt done anything yet , he has nt hurt anything yet , and i am holding back tears because i know that he will . and i know that when he does i will still love him . i will still love him with the painful insanity that i do now . because no matter who his father is , i m his mother .the council chambers roared in outrage . newline newline the sound was a rumble of shouts , squeaks , roars , gurgles , and beeps and boops . newline newline  i say again : the vote was a tie  , thundered an authoritative voice throughout the chamber . newline newline the shouts quieted to a respectful din . newline newline  198,677,364 systems vote in the affirmative  newline  198,677,364 systems vote in the negative  newline newline at this announcement the roars and complaining renewed once more . newline newline  silence  newline newline  chairman qwelicos of sirius has the floor  newline newline a small 3 foot tall grey being drifted onto the center stage of the enormous council chamber . the creature turned its almond shaped glossy black eyes towards the console and then touched a raised panel and began to communicate . newline newline in order to resolve this dispute , we must tabulate the votes of every inhabited system in the galaxy scrolled across translator screens throughout the room . newline newline  we have counted !  shouted a bearlike yet feline heckler . newline newline there is one system that has not voted newline newline if the outrage before was loud , this time it was absolutely deafening . newline newline words such as  sol ! ?  ,  earth ! ?  ,  humans ! ? ,  no  ,  outrageous  ,  savages  , could be heard bandied about . newline newline i present to you : steve , ambassador of sol newline newline a very confused human holding a shopping back was thrust forward to the console on the central platform . newline newline a cybernetic arm grabbed steve s wrist and held his palm to a scanner . newline  ouch !

other :  1  newline newline how does sol vote ?  newline newline newline newline caution : huge wall of text ahead  sorry op , did nt see a limit , so i kinda kept at it   newline newline  never in my life would i have thought i would meet him .  , she started . newline newline  i was shy , and did nt think much of myself at the time , i honestly never thought that the kind , handsome , outgoing man that stole my heart with a passing glance would ever notice me..  she paused , let out a breath , as she smiled ,  but he did  . newline newline  he walked over to me one day , and we started talking , and he was all i could think about for weeks , he miraculously turned the conservative teenage girl in to the happy outgoing woman i am today  newline newline  it s rare , to find true love , to find that special someone to spend your whole life with . i guess i was one of the lucky ones . he made my life better , and we were the best of friends . everyday was a new adventure and every day i spent with him , was the best day of my life .  newline newline  i never knew what i d do without him  , her face became heavy , as she tried her hardest to hold back her emotions , newline newline  every day with him was a day worth living , and a day so full of joy and excitement . towards the end , no matter what the day brought , the magic was ... well , it was just the same as it was the first time , and every day since .  newline newline she could no longer hold back . she began to cry , with much hesitation , she turned her head slightly to right , from the corner of her eye , it had hit , that her worst nightmare was a reality . newline newline calm , with a smile on his face , looking just as handsome as the first day they met , was her husband , in his casket . she walked over to the body , looking down at him with the pain in her heart from losing him , and the joy that seeing him always brought to her face . she touched his hand , and kissed his forehead as she said her final farewell . newline newline with tears in her eyes , her voice breaking she said : newline newline  never did i think that a teenage crush , would make me who i am today , or have such an impact on me ...  she paused , stared at the body one last time , her voice breaking , as memories flashed by , and tears running down her face , she continued newline newline  but he did we didn  t want to be on patrol on christmas eve , crawling through noman  s land in the dead of night looking for krauts sneaking through the mud when people the world over were dancing around trees and drinking spirits full of holiday spices . newline newline yet there we were . and there they were when we slid down the inside of a particularly large shell crater to find three germans huddled around a bottle of liquor in the moonlight . newline newline for a long minute , the three of them stared at us , and the three of us stared at them . my browning auto5 was at my side , sort of held under the weight of my leg . their weapons , gewehr 98s , sat leaned against the dirt behind them . newline newline finally , one of the germans moved  he held out a bottle of liquor in offer . i stayed motionless , my eyes flicking between the german about 15 feet away , and sergeant baynard to my right . after another long pause , sarge shifted himself off the wall of the crater , sauntered over , grabbed the bottle and lifted it in salute before taking a long swig . newline newline the germans , just as silent and motionless as myself and hotchkins , laughed heartily . more bottles were produced , and baynard even managed to reciprocate with a flask of tennessee whiskey , which the krauts enjoyed . newline newline we spent the rest of our patrol in that crater , throwing back swigs of harsh drink , laughing and communicating through a lot of makeshift sign language . pictures of love interests were displayed in the light of the threequarter moon , backs were slapped and the weapons stayed leaning on the side of the crater . newline newline for a few hours , we all forgot that we were there to kill each other . newline newline in the wee hours just before dawn , with the bottles long empty and hugs all around , we crawled back to the west and they crawled east . we made a lot more noise than when we left our lines , falling over barbed wire in our drunken state as we attempted to rejoin our platoon . newline newline that afternoon , we went over the wall , an entire battalion forcing our way across that same noman  s land to pound a breach in the german trenches . baynard fell to a sniper halfway between the lines , and hotchkins hit a landmine as we neared the kraut trenches . i made it through , but as i clamored through trenches full of bodies and blood , i kept expecting to see the faces of my german drinking buddies . newline newline i never did . i don  t know what became of them . who knows , we could have been face to face and not recognized each other after only seeing each other in the dark of night a few hours before . newline newline i d had 19 christmas eves before that one , and i ve been lucky to have many since , but i  ve never had a christmas eve that taught me as much about the brotherhood of man as the christmas eve of 1917 .it was another cold and damp afternoon . the chief sat at his desk behind the paper . typical . the man simply could nt bark his orders without either the local paper or a cup of joe in his hands .  anything of interest today boss ?  newline newline  anything of interest ? it s the holiday season , of course there s something of interest . get your ass down to spencer s gifts , they ve been bitching about some rowdy teens .  newline newline did nt even look up from his article . heading for the door he calls back ,  and i better not get any complaints about you again , ya loose cannon .  newline newline of course he does nt understand . he stays behind a desk all day , he s gone soft . he does nt know what its like to walk down these mean hallways and corridors . the things one will see out here will break normal guys . i swing by dunkin  donuts on the way to spencers . newline newline  have a free one on us today officer sanchez .  newline newline  what for ?  i question , taking a particular look at the coffee karl handed . newline newline  well after you broke up that fight in line a few days ago , i just felt that i owe you one .  the pasty teenager replied . newline newline  karl ...  i say with a heavy sigh .  i m going to take the doughnut and coffee , but i m no hero . never was , and never claimed to be one .  the guy is still a kid , idolizing any man in uniform . he does nt know the truth of how the world works . of course i would claim to be one of the few good ones left on the force . before i leave i call back to karl ,  you know , instances like this make things worthwhile .  newline newline turning the corner to spencers and i notice a large crowd gathered outside , is that crying i hear ? picking up the pace , i see that officer walker is already on scene and flags me over . walker is a young one . i see potential in him and want to take him under my wing , but unfortunately the higher ups tend to schedule him with that bastard garcia . i finally see what the commotion is about ,  christ , is that another body ?  newline newline  it s my grandpappy ! my grandpappy !  the teenage girl cries out . i walk unfazed passed her . i ll get a statement from her after she calms down . newline newline  alright walker , talk to me .  newline newline  uh , some of the shoppers say some teens were horsing around inside spencer s . they took off in a hurry knocking down the poor old man here .  newline newline  the body has nt been moved ?  newline newline  no , of course not .  newline newline  this next part might be a little hard , why do nt you go inside and see if spencer s gots any footage for evidence .  newline newline  sure thing .  the rookie takes his leave and i kneel down beside the cold stiff body . newline newline  alright bub , where does it hurt ?  newline newline  uuh , my knee ... oww ...  the old white guy replies . newline newline shit , this is the worst case i ve seen in months . it s a long shot , but maybe just maybe , i can bring these crooks to justice .batman lifted himself off the ground . he looked around , taking in his new surroundings . newline newline  this is nt gotham .  newline newline the last thing batman remembered was the joker pointing a gun at him , but instead of shooting bullets , a ray of some sort came from the barrel . newline newline  this looks like new york city . but there are buildings in the skyline i do nt recognize .  newline newline batman reached up to his ear to turn on his communicator .  alfred , can you hear me . alfred ?  all batman heard was silence .  my communicator is working , but i m not reaching alfred . i need to figure out where i am .  newline newline batman grabbed his grapple from his belt and shot at a nearby rooftop . he flew through the air and climbed up , studying the skyline through his new perspective . newline newline  this is new york city , but i do nt recognize that building .  batman gazed at a bulding with a large  a  on the side .  i have a feeling that building may hold answers to some of my questions .  newline newline as batman swung from rooftop to rooftop , his mind kept drifting to an incident long ago . back when he was more involved with the justice league , he was transported to another universe where small changes in history lead to very different futures . perhaps this was a similar instance , but how could the joker have gotten his hands on that sort of technology ? newline newline batman arrived on an adjacent building to the tower he sought . it did not appear to have any exterior security measures , similar to a basic office building . batman was scanning the building when he heard an unfamiliar noise coming from behind him . he turned to see what appeared to be a man flying towards him . he appeared to be using some sort of propulsion technology . as the man closed in , he saw it was nt just a man , but a man in a suit of armor . newline newline  you know , i m not really a fan of creepy looking people staring at my building . is there something i can help you with ?  the man in the suit asked as he landed onto the rooftop . newline newline  i m not sure yet . i do nt know who you are .  newline newline  you do nt know who i am ? have you been living in a cave ? if you do nt know who i am , why are you standing outside a building that used to have my name on it ?  newline newline batman studied the man standing opposite of him . the suit was an exoskeleton made of some sort of metal . his movements did nt appear to be hindered by the suit , meaning the man inside was both rich and very intelligent . still , he was nt sure if he could trust this person yet . newline newline  hello ? you still there ? if you just wanted to look at me you could have just googled me and it would have saved us both a lot of trouble . also , what exactly are you supposed to be ? the symbol on your chest looks like a bat , but i do nt know a batman .  newline newline  you do nt know who i am ?  newline newline  no clue . do you really go by batman ?  newline newline batman was starting to get a little frustrated by the tone of this man , but he needed to get information . newline newline  yes , i go by batman . i just arrived in this city a few minutes ago . i was fighting the joker and ...  newline newline  wait , what s the joker s name ?  newline newline  his name is the joker . you ve never heard of him ?  newline newline  haha ! no , i think i d like to though .  newline newline  no ,  batman scowled ,  you would nt . anyway . he hit me with some sort ray and then i was here . you ve never heard of me , or the joker , but i m almost positive this is new york city , but i ve never seen this ... your building before .  newline newline  uh huh . jarvis , do a quick check for batman and joker for me .  newline newline  who s jarvis ? i do nt see anyone here .  newline newline  he s my ai . you should get one for your ... batsuit .  newline newline  i have a butler .  newline newline  a butler ? that s very , rich , of you . anyway , jarvis has definitely never heard of you , so you re not very famous .  newline newline  then jarvis may have confirmed my thought that i am in a different universe .  newline newline  a different universe ? if your suit did nt have so many gadgets on it , i d guess you somehow escaped from an institution of some sort .  newline newline  you re familiar with the multiverse theory i take it ?  newline newline  well yea , i m really smart .  newline newline  good . then stay with me on this . i ve traveled to a different universe before . minor changes in our past lead to our different futures . i d like to go back . my city needs me and there s no telling what the joker might do if he thinks i m dead .  newline newline  right . well , you seem decent enough and my tech could stop you before you could do anything anyway . why do nt you come inside and we ll see if we can get you back to your universe .  newline newline  i would appreciate that . you did nt tell me your name though .  newline newline  my name s tony stark , but i also go by iron man .  newline newline  you think batman is ridiculous , but you go by iron man .  newline newline  iron man is way cooler than batman .  newline newline  and i have an emp that could shut down your tech if i had to .  newline newline  oh wow . you got me . i never thought an emp pulse would take down my suit . i ca nt believe i never thought of that during any of the times i was building any one of my 50ish suits . what ever will i do ?  newline newline  you re very arrogant .  newline newline  and you re very ... scowlly  . newline newline batman and iron man made their way down to the front entrance of avengers tower . newline newline  wait ... so you go by batman , and earlier i asked if you lived in a cave . you do nt actually live in a cave , do you ?  newline newline  of course not . i live in a mansion .  newline newline  that s too bad . the cave really would have helped hammer home the whole bat thing .  newline newline  i work out of a cave though .  newline newline  i knew it ! genies do not often get a chance to demonstrate the raw power of their magic . this was abundantly clear to me when the opportunity arose . because if they did , then there would be no genies left . newline it was just like any other day , i was in my lamp without a care in the world , seeking to trick a traveller . i always enjoyed creating tricks , schemes and riddles to outsmart the common man . but it was on this day i was greeted with someone of higher intelligence rubbing my lamp . i even remember his rub , it almost appeared to be rehearsed . three circular motions with a pause in between each one . not the usual excited and frantic scratching and clawing i , more often than not , experience . i burst from the lamp in the fantastic purple cloud , shimmering and exploding . i call out  you have rescued me from my lamp , and now it is my purpose and debt to grant you three wishes , to gain whatever you desire .  usually describing their action of greed as a rescue  causes them to believe they are deserving of my gifts , that and they begin to feel as if they know more than i , the wise centuriesold , mystical wizard . newline this man who stood before me paused and did not blink nor did he appear to show any emotion , it confused me . the man stared at me and queried ,  i can wish for anything ?  to which i replied  of course , within the boundaries of genie power , yes .  newline  what are those boundaries ?  newline  genies do not answer questions , we grant wishes .  newline  i wish to know the full extent of your power .  it was this wish that perplexed me , they do not normally waste a wish on such a thing . it was as if he were trying to understand me as i could not understand him . but as the proverbial contract existed , i must oblige .  this , is the power i have !  i bellowed out as a thunderstorm appeared above us , and lightning struck down around us in an ecstasy of mayhem ! to which the man , after having observed this act of power once again queried ,  is that the extent of your power ?  newline  you dare question me ? ! you who are curtailed of my immortal power ? !  normally when i exclaim such anger , the wisher asks for simpler things that i can play with . the man gazed at the effect of my power again and made another wish .  bending the weather is not true power , true magical power is in omnipotence . i wish for you to create life .  i had created life before but only in the way of resurrecting it , this was stepping a line , and this man s calm attitude had begun to frighten me .  so be it ! you ask for life and i give you life .  the storm cloud from above struck a lightning bolt between us , from this ash ridden hole nature had spread forth and beautiful creatures , small bacteria sized creatures , began generating . i had never granted a wish so magnificent , i had truly extended beyond my boundaries like never before , i wasallpowerful ! i was godlike ! this was my little eden , and it spread 6 inches in each direction , forming a complex mosaic of variety and life . newline but of course , i could not forget the wisher , it was clear now he looked to trick me , many had tried but none had succeeded . the curiosity , the challenges of power , he was looking for a gold vein to exploit . the man once again , for the final time , challenged me .  creating life is as easy as running your hands through water . true power is in changing what is already constant . i wish for you to demonstrate your power , through the alteration of the past and history .  i grinned , i had got him . his past was my playground and he had given me permission to alter it how i wish . i knew exactly what to do ,  as you wish . let it be known to you this is your final favour from me . good bye .  i placed my palm on his shoulder and saw his history , i corrected his mother s conceiving of him . his whole transaction with me shall cease and i will be free with this life i have birthed . a father newline it was then i apparated in my lamp . cold and oddly confused . feeling tired , i drifted off into a sleep , listening to the footsteps of lone travellers , passing by .so , let s say , hypothetically speaking , you suddenly become the most knowledgeable person on the planet . newline newline also ,

brings the waters forth !  newline newline yes , all the capitals were in there . i could hear them . i nodded beatifically and gestured . one of the village maidens drew closer and handed me a bowl of mead . newline newline  no need to posture , ishka ,  i told the man ,  out with it , i m a totally benevolent person who will try his best to help you out ... because i do nt want to live in a

thingamabob i found in the lab could ve taught me how to speak it . he made worshipful gestures towards the sun nonetheless . newline newline  my king , i beseech thee to wed my fair daughter !  newline newline what is with these people and putting capitals on everything ? it s been nice to benefit from my inadvertent godly  status ever since i came out of that ice tomb but it s a little annoying to deal with this . newline newline another freaking marriage offer . i get how it might be cool and all to have a god  be your soninlaw but it is so not cool to just offer girls to random strangers . newline newline it s on my list somewhere , dealing with gender inequality . somewhere amidst the thousand other modern concepts i need to have around me . newline newline right now , latrines and toilet paper are my priority . also , clean drinking water . also , indoor heating . also , electricity . also newline newline you get the point . newline newline generally i want a lot of things i do nt have at the moment . it s all well and good to wake up in a lab full of super high tech cutting edge equipment but that does nt substitute for more low tech but highly important inventions that make modern life more bearable . newline newline  not interested .  i tell ishaka . the man is crestfallen for a moment . newline newline  then i beseech thee to accept my humble offering that you would enjoy the bounties of my cousin s ladies !  newline newline i slapped a hand to my face . right , gender equality was definitely moving up the list .modded the prompt a little . coffee banned in 2026 . newline newline  no no no !  i yelled at the dock worker .  the dark roast goes in that compartment , the light roast in the back !  newline newline he looked at me befuddled . i quickly repeated myself in spanish . he begrudgingly started moving the bags of beans around . this was it . the united states government had officially lost it  s mind . an ultra patriarchal administration had gotten a super majority , and the country was on track to have more prohibitions than saudi arabia . not sure what they think freedom means , but with these bans , they are pissing a lot of people off . and making a some people , like myself very rich . newline newline  pablo , vamanos !  i shouted . i wasn  t the only one who dropped everything to come to columbia and buy up coffee and cocaine . why coke too , fuck , if i  m gon na be a dealer , i might as well slang . plus all the focus on coffee had pushed down the price of cocaine , so scooping some up now and waiting for prices to normalize could net me a few million . newline newline about 100 meters to my left there was a rusting in the bushes . i slung around the ak47 on my back and shouldered it . the dock was down a secluded dirt road , but it was exactly what smugglers were looking for , so someone trying to steal a load wasn  t uncommon . newline newline seconds dragged by . nothing . the slight hum of

reginald today signed into law ten new prohibitions , including alcohol , tobacco , chewing gum , soda , and fried foods . bans on semi automatic firearms remain stalled in congress . while the protests of these bans have been going on since coffee was banned two years ago in 2026 , as they now turn violent , it has some questioning if the us might be in the brink of civil war.  newline newline oh shit . i hope i come home and have a customer base to sell to . the radio goes dead silent for a moment . newline newline  breaking news !  a different announcer cuts in .  in the wake of the the new round of prohibitions eleven southern states have declared their secession from the united states of america.  newline newline oh dis gon be gud .well this is definitely one of the more interesting days i ve had in years . newline newline i can see the ledge of the high rise from here . the one i almost just jumped off of . newline newline why did nt i ? because i never do . i ve almost done it three times now and i ve never once taken that last step . newline newline the ledge looks really high up . i definitely would have died if i jumped off that . newline newline look at all these people , looking at me . that guy has his cell phone . probably calling 911 . and that lady is pressing her hands on my stomach . oh right , the blood . newline newline i really did nt think it would go like this . that guy was taking her purse . i thought if i just stepped in ... maybe he would just give up or something . guess that was a mistake . newline newline the purse probably was

newline  newline newline the mild blue flash always attracted the same awestruck attention . the process had become almost routine . two men , jaunt and dressed in rags approached the light . sometimes they attacked on sight . sometimes they stood there , dumbfounded . sometimes , they would drop to their knees and worship me as i appeared , a human like them but clearly not belonging to their world . newline newline the end result was always the same , however . a click from my incapacitator and they dropped where they stood , immobile but still alive . for what it s worth , anyway . one of them had already developed a cancerous swelling and was not long for this world . the other looked barely a man grown . perhaps he could brave this living nightmare a while longer . perhaps killing him would be a mercy . perhaps . i ve learned that disturbing timelines that do nt belong to you is not a good idea . after all , that s how i ve got into this mess to begin with . newline

human life that remained had regressed to stoneage technology , scavengers that barely wielded the technology they once created while barely maintaining their sanity and health in an environment borne of what their scientists call fallout  . i wonder briefly who loosed the nukes this time . the comrade ? the president ? the emporer ? newline newline i trekked the wastes for several hours . the natives were afraid of me , as always , but there was little they could do . but i did not come across any records . nothing was written down . nothing useful , anyway . while some details of the story varied , the gist of it was always the same . the comrades of the east and the presidents of the west were engaged in a bloody landgrab that lasted for decades . their power was evenly matched and neither would settle for anything but absolute dominance over the european continent . eventually , one of them invented nuclear weapons and unleashed them with impudence . the other side stole the design and responded in kind . the result was annihilation . of both sides . of countless countless timelines , there had never been a winner of the nuclear war . newline newline i sighed and shook my head . there were no answers in this timeline . newline newline i unbuckle the device from my hip and set it for my return journey . i carefully copy the exact time i ve written down on paper . missing the connection by one second would already put my son s life in jeopardy . newline newline as i try to overcome the vertigo of impending timetravel i wonder briefly how i am still alive . the weapons that these mysterious , eldritch assassins brought with them are so mindbogglingly powerful that i reasonably would nt have stood a chance to defeat them . could it be that god truly was looking out for me ? looking out for little adolf so that he could once fulfil the job that he was chosen to do ? or was i simply being unknowingly aided by those timelines that would undo the evil caused by the first . newline newline home was a welcome sight . breathing heavily , i went inside and sat down at my book to document my latest excursion . the parameters of the timeline and the end result :  mutual assured destruction  . just like all the others . my head collapsed into my arms onto the table and i wanted to cry for humanity . newline newline somehow , i had pieced together , my son s destiny was to avert this disaster . but i still did not know why . nor did i know , if adolf was meant to save humanity , why humanity would want him dead . if only i could travel within the 20th century . if only i could visit futures in which my son was still alive . newline newline staring the device into performing what i wanted it to do was of little use . i d gathered from one of the assassins that had survived our initial confrontation that it s functionality was purposely restricted . to prevent meddling with the wrong pasts , i am sure . or to prevent me from coming after the bastards . i was nt entirely sure . the language the assassins spoke was like no other , and they were not too keen on providing answers . newline newline i got up and collected myself . i would figure it out . and if not , i would just have to spend my life protecting my son from all those that would harm him . he is meant for greatness , and i will not let anyone , present or future , take that from him . newline newline perhaps one more trip before bed ...when they came , they came like the late summer storms that sweep across the plain in a violent whirlwind , covering the land in a premature night . we stood no chance , though ourselves a violent people , their methods of war were far superior to ours . in no time the massacre was over , any resistance was dealt with with such speed it seemed they knew our very thoughts . our warriors who had seemed so powerful and stood so tall now lay in bloody ruin , destroyed in mere moments where they had stood when the bloodbath began . the rest of us were quickly dealt with , locked in chains we could hardly comprehend , let alone produce . newline newline our conquerors then spirited us away on impossible ships , taking us across distances we had thought no living being could traverse to lands completely foreign . there we were made their slaves . newline newline i have worked this foreign soil for practically my whole life and have come no closer to knowing my masters than the day i arrived here . but as i work this new planet , light years from the earth i once called home , i can tell we never had a chance . dear humans , this message has been written in the most widely spoken language of your planet and updated several times to ensure that is the case . with your recent arrival at this location , your species has reached the level of space travel to be considered to join other species across the galaxy as a member species of the galactic parliament . the opening of this box has sent out a signal , indicating the beginning of your inspection period . we will try to avoid all detection during the inspection , as to not disturb the natural order of your planet or its customs . if you fail to meet our standards , we will review our decision after fifty years . you will be notified once you meet out standards .  i finished reading the text inside the box and took a deep breath , trying to calm my shaking hands . the radio was silent , but we were all thinkin the same thing . it turns out we really are nt alone .soft blue light filled the cave as the three walked down ruts in the ground , wellworn over time by the feet of tribe members and the dragging of prey into the tunnel homes below . the harsh illumination flickered along the walls with their steps , though they bore no torch or orb of magical illumination . you see , underogres like them glow in the dark . well , usually . newline the leader was sullen this night . not only did he have to walk point on the way back from this hunting trip , but with new meat along . he could practically hear the unasked questions forming in the newcomer s mind . it would nt be long before the silence broke . every night would be like this for some time . newline blast chief ungorth s greed ! had he not challenged and slain the rival tribe s leader in battle , then this merging would never have happened and no one would question his cursemark . he hated the rest of the village , but at least they were mostly bored of picking on him . newline  so , he can turn into a dragon or somin  , right ?  new meat asked of their companion , a grinning fool named gouger . the leader would learn new meat s name if he survived the night , which seemed less and less likely the more he opened his mouth .  mark like tha cross his back and he s got ta have somin  big up his sleeve .  newline  no , nothin  like that ,  said gouger .  he jus  breathes fire is all . idnat right , pinkwings ?  newline  gon na kill you slow one day , gouger .  newline his name was palewings , though that was nt much better . the large and roughly dragonshaped patch of pale skin on his back stubbornly refused to emit blue light as was natural and proper .  pinkwings  is what everyone called him since at birth his mark had been pale pink like human skin . years of life underground and being on the surface only in the night had turned it pale white , but the name stuck . newline his mother had insisted she d bedded a dragon in underogre form . but the color of the mark had ratted her out as a filthy humiehugger . had he any idea which of the broodmatrons had birthed him , he d have thrown her down the deepest hole he could find . newline  i m beggin  ye , spare me , great wing d one ,  gouger cried in mock fear .  pray do nt roast me alive !  palewings hunched his shoulders and slowed his walk , letting them catch up to him within arm s reach . new meat , annoyed at the lack of a clear answer , made the mistake of opening his mouth again . newline  so , is he a dragon ? does he breathe fire or n  !  newline he cut off sharply and awoke some time later to find himself laying in a heap atop the still dazed gouger . newline  i don  breathe fire , i don  turn inna a dragon , and i m not gunna challenge chief for command and lead us to victory over the surface or any other goblin crap ! but i tell you what i do . i hit hard like a strong underogre . now leave off my pale spot , new meat . i am playing the long game . the easy game . sure , i could ve gone for the oneonone like avarick but his plans work much better in a zerosum environment which he was so luckily given . to much effort . ironically , lux and gully have it much easier than me  the human mold was builtforpurpose as their collective thrones . still tiring . newline newline then there s ira , old ira . he used to play with one man at a time , and for a while it netted him some impressive numbers here and there . then there came the kumbaya s and  give peace a chance  and since then he s shifted , cleverly . he exploits the work of superboy and viddy  he used to boil blood , push little toys across maps of the world . now he drives wedges . that hammer looks real heavy , though . viddy and superboy decided to pool their efforts  hate for others and longing for their place ? strange bedfellows , but the human mind seems eager to accommodate . newline newline i did one thing , only one  and it has ensured that i succeed where the others toil . i made quitting a drug . the euphoria of just staying in , of handing in your 2 week notice . the joyful freedom and lightness is intoxicating . in a sense , i am lucky to have the three business types slaving away , making life easier for the bipedal insects . because the easier life is , the more extraneous life fulfilling  things the monkeys find . the more things there are that can be discarded , the more things are . until finally , putting that gym membership on hold wo nt be enough , then waiting for the movie to go on cable does nt do it anymore , then pulling the sheers up over your face does nt give the kick it used to . ultimately the biggest high reveals itself . how could they have been so blind ? not seen it sooner ? being is the ultimate commitment . each and every one of these socalled thinking  apes will give in to the temptation . one by one they simply stop . quitting  the final high .if you re actually interested , i can work with you to make the story more suited to your filming restrictions . i m definitely not dead set on the names . also , i ve never written a screenplay before , but would be willing to try .  newline newline ring ring ring jenna awoke , tangled in her bed sheets , to the sound of her cellphone . she warily reached out a hand to grab her phone and answered it , still half asleep . newline newline  jenna ? jenna , are you there ? !  came her mom  s voice from the other end of the line . newline newline  yep ,  jenna replied with a yawn .  what  s so important ?  newline newline  your brother , is he there with you ?  newline newline  no , why would he be here ?  newline newline  he  s missing . we can  t find any sign of him . i think he might have been kidnapped . if you see him , let us know right away . we  re calling the cops right now.  newline newline jenna found herself wideawake all of a sudden . she put down her phone and noticed something on her nightstand . there were three things that hadn  t been there before , but of the most importance was a blue yoyo . an old , battered one that distinctly belonged to her much younger brother . newline newline when she found the envelope beside it , she was shocked to find  10,000 in it . and then she picked up the note . she placed a hand on her mouth , trying to stifle her own scream . newline newline yes , we have your brother . you should have found out by now that he is missing . you must be wondering why we would take your brother . it  s quite simple  we have a job we need you to do . if you finish it , then we will return your brother . consider the money as prepayment for your services . if you refuse to comply or feel like letting anyone know about this , your brother  s life will be exterminated with extreme prejudice .  newline newline your job is as follows : you will go to good times bar tonight at 11:00 . bring the yoyo . your target will be a sleazy senator . he will be sitting at the bar looking for a hookup . you are just his type , so you will seduce him and bring him back to the baltimore motel down the street . one of our people will have slipped him something in his drink , so you should find it rather easy to do your job . wait for him to pass out in the motel . when he does , use the yoyo  s string and choke him to death . when it  s finished , go into the bathroom to find the instructions for getting your brother back .  newline newline as a final note , failure to comply at any stage will mean an instant death for your brother . the senator plans to propose a bill that would lead to countless families being pushed out onto the street and many more people dying from poverty . we would like to assure you that you are doing the right thing .  newline newline the note fell out of her hands . she didn  t know what to believe . she walked to her front door and saw that it was left unlocked , very unlike it was when she went to bed . jenna sat on her bed and contemplated what to do . newline newline  this is ridiculous . how can this even be real ?  she said out to the room . newline newline she reached for her phone , but before she could dial for the police , it started to ring . private number was all the caller id said . she picked it up . a deep voice came from the other end . newline newline  this is your only warning . we are watching your every move . this goes far deeper than you might imagine.  newline newline jenna stood paralyzed in fear while the phone stayed silent for a minute . newline newline  jenna !  cried a tiny voice . newline newline the other end of the line went dead . she dropped her phone on the ground . she held the envelope in her hand . what could she do ? she had no option but to do what they wanted until she could find her brother . she laid back in bed and covered her face with her pillow , half hoping she would have the strength to suffocate herself now , and cried . newline newline she found herself ready to leave for the bar . she had the envelope of cash on her as well . she slowly walked out of her apartment and locked the door behind her , not that it seemed to matter much last night . newline newline she found herself walking into the bar . the senator wasn  t hard to recognize at all . he still had a suit on , the only guy in the bar dressed as such , and an american pin on it . she walked over to him , uncomfortable in the high heels she was wearing . she didn  t normally get dressed up like this , but tonight she took out her nicest and flirtatious black dress and matching heels . she sat right next to him . he took notice of her right away and before she could even order a drink , he was already offering to buy one for her . newline newline  how about a vodka tonic for the lady ,  he said to the bar tender . newline newline  thanks ,  she replied .  what  s your name ?  newline newline  senator hamsworth , but you can call me george.  newline newline he ordered a martini for himself . they made small talk for a few minutes , but she noticed he was starting to act a little weird . he must have been drugged already . she swallowed hard , knowing that she could never come back from what she was about to do . she leaned over and whispered into his ear seductively . newline newline  hey , enough with the small talk . i know we  d both rather be doing something else right now . i know a place down the street where we can have some fun.  newline newline even though he  d only had a couple drinks , he was acting like he was completely wasted . he slapped down some money to the barkeep to pay for their drinks and she led him out to the street . she grabbed his tie and led him down to the assigned motel . at this point he was barely functional . jenna found herself wondering if she could even get him to the room in time . she ended up pulling out a hundred from the envelope to pay for the room . newline newline jenna was thankful that george had held it together enough to make it to the room . however , she found herself feeling the opposite within a minute . assuming that they were there to hookup , he started to drunkenly make out with her . it was the most repulsive kiss jenna had ever had . they moved towards the bed and she could feel him slipping her dress off . all of a sudden , he passed out right on top of her while trying to grope her bottom . she struggled to push him off of her and finally succeeded . newline newline jenna looked around the empty room and pulled her brother  s beloved yoyo out of her tiny purse . she let it completely unwind and then got onto the bed , behind the senator  s passed out body . she put him into a slightly sitting position . she pulled the string across his neck and then began to pull . he gave no signs of resistance , except for his body making some choking noises as it tried to breathe . she couldn  t believe she was really doing it . it was surreal , almost like a distant , barely remembered dream . newline newline jenna sat there and cried for a minute as she let his body slide back down on the bed . no pulse , nor breath , issued from the newly deceased senator . she felt absolutely hysterical . where was her brother ? she  d done what they wanted . she walked over to the bathroom and opened the door . a sharp pain came upon her face and she blacked out . newline newline she awoke to herself on the bed , beside the senator . she was naked and sore all over . george was still dead , but now he was on the floor , the blue yoyo on the floor in front of him . the police broke down the door . she looked wearily at them , completely out of energy , finding it hard to keep her eyes open . newline newline one of the police officer  s came out of the bathroom holding her younger brother , tied up and crying , but otherwise alright . the  100 bills from the envelope were scattered across the room . jenna watched as they approached her , but she passed out again . newline newline this time she awoke in a hospital , her parents and younger brother surrounding her . newline newline  what happened ?  she asked . she decided that until she found out all the details , she would feign forgetting everything that  d happened . newline newline  you saved your little brother ,  her dad replied .  without you , who knows what was going to happen . don  t you remember anything ?  newline newline  no ,  she lied .  i just remember getting a call from mom that he was missing , and then waking up in some motel , and then here.  newline newline  the person you saw in the motel was a senator ,  her dad said . the police haven  t figured out his motive , but he kidnapped your brother . he then got ahold of you and threatened your brother unless you showed up with  10,000 in cash . when you met up with him , he wanted more than the cash . according to the police , you followed him from the bar to a motel . there , you found your brother in the bathroom and you two got into a large fight . apparently he made the mistake of drinking too much , and you capitalized on that and took the only weapon you could find , your brother  s yoyo , and choked him to death before passing out.  newline newline  seriously ,  she responded . jenna couldn  t believe that was what the police were thinking . but then she remembered how thorough these people had been and that the  10,000 was also payment for her services . somehow they had set it all up . she didn  t want to know more  in fact , she hoped they would never contact her again . newline newline  yes honey . we  re glad your okay though.  newline newline jenna looked over to her little brother and smiled , knowing that at least for now , he was safe . newline newline 144as i stand here and get lost into those eyes . i ca nt tell you how many moments have gone by or if you ll find peace inside your mind . the peace i talk about is nt comfort nor love . it s wholeness , simplicity , calm , without the need for another . newline newline i felt that . and now i understand it . newline newline with these arms , i hold you and offer a chance to feel a strength of your own . too much you rely on your brothers . too much you rely on distraction . those things are not life . newline newline  what is life ?  jenneth , prince of palaquin , asked . newline newline a booming laughter erupted deep inside my stone chest . life  youngin  is nothing more than breath . the flesh and mud of your blood boils , and that is all there is to life . newline newline to feel deserving of more is selfish . newline newline palquin stared into my eyes .  but that s not right . why then , do we fight so hard for these things ?  newline newline you re being moronic . thinking like a human will only give human answers . think of it from my perspective . i ve seen life for thousands of years . your thoughts , words , and actions are not as important as you believe my son . live because it gives you life . do not give or take life to live . newlineit began innocently enough : a comment on a backwater website elaborating a critique of my greatest work . it was a lukewarm review , and this is what puzzles me so much . at worst it accused my work of being cliche  and this , as the author of my works , i do believe is true considering how similar my work is to so many others  , at best it was a matter of personal taste . what harm would come in generating discussion ? what harm would come in shedding some light on some of my contemporaries to whom chance was not as kind as she was to newline newline the call me the prophet of the void , the herald of the end of times . my work it appears resonated with a particularly apocalyptic frequency . i thought it was a mere curiosity that the preppers and doomsayers interjected quotes from my work in their discourses , their warnings , their letters of concern and demand to the government . newline newline  the end is nigh , the end is nigh , the end is night ,  that is what benson says as the sun sets and he sits on a cliff overlooking the ocean and he is convinced he will not wake up in the morning . the toxic atmosphere will kill him , shrivel his lungs until he is only capable of pathetic gasps for air . benson is a fiction of course , a figment of my wayward imagination that was weened on the paranoid works of my predecessors . newline newline i have always considered my works exploratory , a sign of a consciousness that flits from opinion to opinion , unable to convince itself of any . i explored the many paths of truth , the many steps that one might take in life , the many steps the world might take in return , but i myself let a quiet , contemplative life . i refused interviews , refused television appearances , once in my early career i agreed to do a reading in a library , but that was before the lost future , the end of ends , and bunker in the rockies .  the only definitive proof of my authorship is that photo , grainy and pixelated in the innards of a local newspaper which name escapes me . newline newline there is also my agent . i would imagine that she would be able to corroborate my claims , but they have cut the phone lines and from my cellphone there is only static . newline newline i wonder what they look like , these men outside the door . it is an assumption that they are men , of course , but their voices seem deep and gruff . they bang on the door , but the door is a reinforced slab of metal . what can i say ? i am paranoid , they are paranoid , i am certain that in another life we would have gotten along well together . a life in which i did not right a review that did not speak to the  undeniable pulse mr. akensazi has on the american population .  newline newline my last name is actually johansen . i suppose that is the name that showed up when they analyzed my ip address and traced it back to my house , my home . i suppose , actually , it was my neighborhood . the exact details of how they found out it was me elude me still . this is what i have thought about for the last few days of my lock down . newline newline i have supplies of food and water to last months , even years if i ration . there are certain medicines that i have been unable to get in large quantities , my therapist seemed to think that it would  indulge  my fantasies to stockpile them . he was a curious man , dr. quereshi , always referred to the end of the world as my  fantasy  rather than my fear .  i am preparing ,  i told him ,  just in case .  he always chose his words carefully , always danced about the issue . he was a good man , dr. quershi . i wonder if i shall see him again . newline newline the men knock on my door more and more insistently . they say they are the police , they say they are my friends , they say they are my agent , my publisher , a concerned citizen , but i hear them plot among themselves , and i keep the door sealed . newline newline there is food and water for months if i ration . i have run out of pills , but it is no matter . i am safe so long as i do not go outside . newline newline how long has it been now ? days , weeks , perhaps even months . the days bleed into each other , but i am rationing and i will outlast the men on the outside , the irrational men who could not bear to see my work criticized . good men , i suppose , who agreed so strongly with me that they could nt stomach my feigned disagreement . newline newline most days all i here is silence , but sometimes when i listen closely , put my face against the cold metal sheaths that seal the windows , i hear them shuffling outside in a makeshift camp they ve set up . a strategy of silence , you see , of attrition . i , however , am rationing . i in here may last months , years , decades if i stretch it thin enough . newline newline last night i dreamed of the sun setting into the ocean and the ocean evaporating into a cloud of cyanide . i did not know why it was cyanide , but it was , i was certain . i saw the cloud approaching and i had nowhere to run , nowhere to hide , so i had to face it , allow it to envelope me , and suffocate me dry . newline newline i awoke . i ate . i rationed . newline newline i dreamed again . or perhaps i merely thought it , these days there seems little difference between the two . i dreamed of a world in which i did not write , in which i merely led an average life and was not prepared for the end of days  just in case  . this scenario ends in dying . newline newline i dream again and again again . most days i dream , most nights i dream , it is like that in this metal shell , this second skin that protects me from those aside . newline newline one time i stood by the switch that would open the door and open the windows and i thought about flipping it . newline newline but the men are outside , and i quickly walked away , terrified by the momentary lapse in judgement .jake materialized in the holding cell . he looked over to the digital clock and only knew it was 3:00 pm . newline newline the guard dryly states

at their heels . new sprouts , painted red by the rain , stretched their stems to the sky , like thousands of leafy hands reaching out to pull them under . newline newline father clamped amber s arm in an iron grip , lifting her up whenever her boots sunk too deep into the mud . newline newline  where are we going ?  she shouted above the rain . rain pounded on her head , and her heart beat in her ears . newline newline father slung the rifle over his shoulder , and turned to her . he opened his mouth to say something , but was cut off by a sound from above . newline newline there was a screaming in the sky , like a massive bird bearing down on it s prey . a ball of fire tumbled toward the earth , and disappeared behind the hill they had just come from . a moment later the earth vomited up dirt and flames . newline newline father yanked on her arm so hard she thought it would pop out . she yelped in pain , but father did not stop . newline newline the sky strobed with light . streaking spears slammed into dark shapes that seemed to be stuck in the sky , like clouds pregnant with rain . every now and then , she would look up to see another dark shape dislodge itself from the heavens and fall to the earth . newline newline tears carved streams through the blood that caked on her face  blood that was not hers . newline newline they ran for what felt like hours , though the moon hardly moved . amber stumbled more than once , and after she fell for the first time , father lifted her onto his back , and told her to hang on . newline newline  father , where are we going ? the village is the other way .  newline newline father shook his head ,  we re not going that way , sweet girl .  newline newline  why not ?  newline newline her eyelids were drooping , and she nuzzled her head in the crook of his neck , letting the steady bounce of his stride soothe her . newline newline  too far . we ll make the journey when ... when this stops . we re going to the caves first .  newline newline she struggled to speak through a yawn ,  who are they , father ?  newline newline if he answered , she did not hear . amber , with her hair plastered by the blood of those above , was asleep . newline newline when she woke , she could not see . her father s arms were around her , squeezing her tight . by the steady rise and fall of his chest , she could tell he was sleeping . it was still a struggle to escape from his embrace . newline newline she stood up , disoriented in the darkness . her face was stiff with dried blood . a ball of emotion threatened to crawl up her throat , but she swallowed it . mother had always chided her for being too emotional . newline newline amber turned around , and was greeted by a dark blue sky , halfswallowed by the mouth of the cave . there were stars above . there were two shambling shapes below . newline newline people . they were dragging a third person by the arms . newline newline amber almost called out to them , until she noticed their eyes : they were glowing . a thought raced through her mind : not human .  newline newline before she could duck back into the cave , she heard one of them shout . amber scampered back into the recesses of the cave , and kneeled over her father s sleeping form . newline newline  father ,  she shook him ,  father , wake up .  newline newline  huh ...  newline newline  father , it s them ,  her voice was a hoarse whisper ,  they re here !  newline newline his eyes opened slowly . then closed . then snapped open . he sat up , fumbled around for his rifle , and clicked open its barrel . newline newline  do nt move ,  a voice said from the entrance of the cave . newline newline a woman , with hair like clay made from pure silver , blocked the starlight . newline newline father lifted the rifle , and pulled the trigger . there was an earshattering bang ,  and the woman doubled over with a grunt . she stumbled back , cupping her hands over where the bullet had landed . when she pulled her hands away , there was no blood . newline newline the woman set her glowing eyes on father , and grinned . newline newline she spoke in a voice as pure as a

brothers and sisters have tried numerous times to kill me . i was always the favorite of our parents . mother and father always praised my brilliance . being from a noble family , they only cared about who the successor would be . by tradition , it would be the eldest son , my older brother . however , i was so far ahead of all of my siblings , even him , that my parents began to groom me . he became jealous .  the youngest will be the head of the house ? that s absurd !  he screamed at our parents after they had revealed the news . he stormed out of the room while the rest of my siblings glared at me . twelve pairs of eyes , showing nothing but contempt . since that day , they have tried numerous times for the past five years to kill me ... and i ve grown tired of it . it s time to end it once and for all . but do you looooove him ?  ela teased , but drew back once she realized what she had said . her eyes dimmed like blownout candles .  i mean ... can you love now ? with all that ... junk in your brain ?  newline newline i could feel my eyes tightening like redhot coils . i felt like some part of me was.. untethering . letting go . dimming out . sometimes i wish i could just  newline no . breathe . rein it back in . stay here . newline newline  i can love ,  i said ,  just like you can . i m not a damn robot , ela .  why has this been happening ? i ve been so angry lately . always so angry . maybe dangerously angry . i was starting to worry . there were a couple spots in my memory . dark spots . things happened that i do nt remember . bad things  i know , because i d come back to awareness a few times with blood on my knuckles . newline newline i turned from her and searched the patio of the coffee shop for something , anything , to cool me down . settled on some weird icey thing with so much whipped cream and sauce and wafers in it that it looked like liquid diabetes with diabetes sprinkled on top . i wanted it . newline newline i turned back to ela as she spoke .  jonsan . i did nt mean it .  i nodded enough to let her know she d been heard . but if i looked at her , really caught her muddy brown eyes with my waterblue ones , i d feel the anger again . but maybe not looking at her made it worse , because it made the disgust in her voice that much clearer . newline newline  look , i m sorry . i did nt mean to hurt your feelings , okay ? it s just ... hard . getting used to it . you . we thought you were dead , after that accident .  newline newline so did i . newline newline  we came to terms with it . accepted it . this is hard for us , too .  her voice wavered a little , and once i may have felt sorry for her . i may have touched her hand and comforted her . but instead , i felt the darkness creeping in . i was losing it , losing touch again , i could nt let it  newline newline  listen , fucko . this is nt easy for me , either . how the hell do you think it is for me ?  i yanked at my shirt , because it kept me from yanking the hair out of her skull . i d gotten so used to fidgeting around , always pulling and tugging , anxious that some part of my circuitry was showing . i could feel my voice rising . newline newline  are you seriously giving me this shit right now ? trying to act like it s soooo hard for you to deal , when i have to fucking live with fake legs and half a fake brain ?  my fingers tightened on my shirt and squeezed . i imagined it was her neck . i was starting to lose it again , starting to go away inside . something else was coming out .  god , sometimes i think you d benefit from a double lobotomy . someday , i just fuckin  mi  newline newline newline newline   ight .  wait , what ? i was just in a cafe , was nt i ? what happened ? newline newline  ... . serious errors ,  said a voice above me . newline newline i realized my eyes were closed , and opened them . and found a place kind of like a library , except it was all metal , and i was lying on a metal slab in it . naked . newline newline i struggled to rise , panic ratcheting from the pit of my stomach to my throat . where the hell  newline newline  ahh , you re awake !  said the voice , which must have belonged to the little man in front of me that looked more rat than man , with a ratty little nose and watery little rat eyes . newline newline  i m awake ,  i agreed , and looked about me . there were tools everywhere . machines . a couple mecha legs here , a couple mecha arms there . the kind of stuff that gave me a good idea of where i was . newline newline  you re the guy . the one who made me ... like this . are nt you .  it was nt a question . newline newline  well , yes !  he sounded proud . like a hyped up little puppy . newline newline  why the fuck am i here ? did you mess something up ? is that why i ve been losing it ? what did you do to me ?  i think my voice rose an octave  and a decibel  with each word .  is it ? !  newline newline  there have been ... some errors .  newline newline i wanted to cry . i wanted to scream and maybe also throw things and beat my fists on the ground . but i did nt . i wanted to cover up , too , but there was nt anything to cover that he had nt already seen . this was the man that took me in , all broken from when i d been splatted between a wall and a selfdriving car gone rogue . he d seen more of my body than anyone else ever had . newline newline my legs had been crushed , my hips splintered . my head had been partly caved in , too . from what they tell me , i mean . not like i saw it . or remember it . he d rebuilt me  we have the technology !  , my brain all repaired with some kind of fauxorganic material thanks to his homemade nanobots , and my legs torn away and replaced with some freakish pistony mecha things from some kind of scifi movie . newline newline all bought and paid for by ice mama dearest , who now could nt even bother to call the thing that used to be her daughter . anger flamed in me , hot as summer . newline newline wait . normally , there d be more than anger here . right ? i feel like i should be dimming out , starting to lose my grip ... but i m not . this anger is normal , standardissue . newline newline  did you fix me ?  i asked , and the childish hope in my voice made me want to cringe . newline newline  you re all fixed up !  he said proudly .  just a little problem the nanobots had when they were reconstructing one of your lobes . a simple little rewiring , yes , and you re good as new !  newline newline  thank god . thank you , i mean .  relief flooded me and i felt tears swarm my eyes and drip down my cheeks .  i have people i need to ... apologize to .  newline newline i looked up at him , and did nt like what i saw there . he looked shifty . uncomfortable , like there was something he was dreading telling me . newline newline  what ? what is it ?  newline newline  well , you see , i  it s just  when your circuits overheat , you see , a signal s sent to me  just so i know you re working correctly , you know . and  and   newline newline  and what ?  i pressed , and my annoyance leaked into my voice . newline newline  there was something wrong . with your emotion center . you d get angry , quite angry , yes , and then ... lose control of what you were doing . you ... you hurt people . a few people .  newline newline  no ! no , no , i never ever lost control ! i never hurt anyone !  no . no . no . newline newline  i m afraid you did ,  he said , and his voice turned soft and pitying . i found myself beginning to hate him .  your ... your mother , jonsan . she nearly died .  newline newline i was losing it again . but this time , not in anger . in sorrow . i could have drowned us both in the tears that fled my eyes in the next few moments . i could nt believe it , but it explained so much . why i could nt remember things . dark windows in my memory . newline newline  is she okay ? she s all right now , yeah ? i can see her ?  newline newline  she s in the hospital , but she s expected to make a full recovery . she s the one who called it in . at first i , i did nt realize that the overheatsignals i was getting from you signified violent outbursts . there were other people , jonsan , that you hurt . we just.. just did nt know . until now . what you were doing . but it s obvious you did nt remember doing it . any of it . it was nt your fault .  newline newline it was all fluff after that . i was okayed to go home , with a guarantee that my fuckedup halfbrain would work just as it always did . newline newline i stayed away from people , for a while . could nt face em , not after what i d done . things i did nt remember . things i only had heard about from ratface , once i d demanded he go into more detail . mom had shut up all of my ... victims . apparently , she spent quite a bit of money to keep her ruffian child a secret . newline newline . . . newline a few weeks after the incident , i texted ela . she agreed to meet me , so i went to her house one sunny afternoon , hoping i could apologize , and things would be like normal . newline newline no dice . newline newline  so , ela ,  i said , after she d invited me to sit .  how ve you been ?  i tried a smile , but it probably looked more like a wince . newline newline she eyed me . the dangerous cyborg . things always get out no matter how hard you try to keep them secret , ma . newline newline  i ve been great . except for my best friend going nuts on me in a cafe . in front of so many people ! god damn , that was embarrassing . if you ever do something like that again , i m going to issue a worldwide avoidjonsan alert .  newline newline a flash of anger , quickly curbed  hey , i probably deserved that . newline newline  i m really sorry , ela . it was nt my fault , i swear . i do nt remember any of it . you know ... you know i m not like that .  newline newline  i do nt know who you are anymore , jonsan . i m starting to not want to find out .  newline she looked me full in the eyes , mudbrown to waterblue . newline newline did i say mudbrown ? i meant frozen dirt . newline newline  i m the same person as always , ela . they fixed me ! i m okay now . i m ... i m safe .  newline newline it was ela s turn to avoid my eyes .  yeah , except ... you needed to be fixed . people do nt go to a mechanic and get fixed . machines do .  newline newline  i m only part machine ,  i said , trying to smile . smile , ela . do nt do this . newline newline  you re not the friend i used to know , jonsan .  she sucked in a breath and looked at me .  i know what you did to your own mother . your own mother , jonsan ! you re not a human anymore , you re a monster !  her voice had become a banshee scream . newline newline i reached for her hand , but she pulled back . i tasted anger , hot on my tongue . newline newline  ela , just   newline newline  no . i need you to leave . please . just get out . just get the hell out .  newline newline there was nothing else to say . so i did . newline newline . . . newline newline where d all this blood come from ? newline newline newline  newline i wrote this right before bedtime ,

newlineas he looked down the valley below , the loud cheers of the people there could be heard like they were next to him . it was finally over , the final stone had been placed and the protecter beams had , for the first time , been locked into place . no longer could the darkness of sodrow seep into the valley , no longer did children have to sleep in their mothers arms to stop the nightmares . this was a day that would never be forgotten . newline newline years had past since it had all started . this was evident from the grey hairs that had started to grow from on gren s chin and the stiffness in his back and arms . he turned around and looked at those who had followed him . through thick and thin they were still by his side , loyal till the end . frim , dorg , wastal , hadvar and astrid . some of greatest friends he d ever had . there were others though , ones who had been lost by this everlasting quest . gren could only hope their souls found peace in the afterlife . each one of them had volenteered . their lives were on him and would be for the rest of his days . but their losses had not gone in vain . the sun was shining in the valley of danren once more . the darkness had faded back to the hell from wence it came and would never return . newline newline it was not just the valley that had been saved but gren himself . before this all began he was but a lonely tavern regular contemplating suicide every night before he drank himself to sleep . in truth , it was the darkness that had truly saved him . it moulded him into the hero that stands tall today . it was then , in the peaceful sunset , that gren would finally have to ask himself ... what now ?chapter 12 , war comes to great britain . newline newline leading up to the industrial revolution , the british had expanded their empire almost across the globe . the first years of this grand expansion had witnessed the ottoman turks and mongolians being crushed beneath the iron boot of imperialism . when turkish and mongolian swordsmen met the might of the british army on land , when iron and steel met gunpowder , it was a foregone conclusion . this is not to say that the british easily defeated their enemies , with numerous battles raging over several years and land gained and lost , but eventually the last cities fell and peace was restored . with the advent of steam , long gone was the threat that pirates in their sailing ships had ever caused , as well as the odd american frigate that might try to test the british resolve . newline newline starting in 1860 , a series of running skirmishes along the british american border further pointed to the tension between the two nations . the tension finally culminated with a pitched naval battle just off the coast of washington where the british fleet of monitors faced off against three times their number of sailing frigates . though outgunned , the american fleet soundly defeating the british , forcing a stalemate that would last another two years before a cease fire could be called . newline newline it was during this cease fire that disaster struck . on sunday morning at 9:51 gmt , december 11th , 1862 , strange vehicles were seen in the skies . these vehicles , resembling like great birds to the british , slowly droned over london . moments later , a great flash of light , brighter than the sun itself , blew across the city . when the dust had finally settled , little of the city still stood . this great flash , known later as  the day of reckoning  , was the first step in his imperial eminence and protector of the weak , emperor ghandi s bid to finally punish the insolence of the upstart nation . over the course of the next two weeks , strange submersible ships sank every last british ship , while great ships bristling with guns pounded the cities into rubble . the war was swift , and devastating , but it was not to be the end , as will be covered in the next chapter : chapter 13 , britain and  the bomb .  i do not think this is a good idea .  the genie floated there crossed legged in a suit and looking somewhat like a blue iridecent bob barker . newline newline  i

newline  this is your third wish . the second was to go back and undo the affects of the first . unfortunatly they still counted against you . only one wish left .  newline newline the holder of the lamp looked afraid  what was my first wish ?  newline newline  exactly what you wished for now .  newline newline  why would i change that ? jordan was my everything .  newline newline the genie held out a piece of paper .  you asked me for a favor before you went back .  newline newline the piece of paper held a simple phrase  we were not ourselves .  newline newline  i will fullfill any wish ,

fade to black  newlineit started slowly at first , for a second i thought it was just my imagination or even some sort of static in the field that held time still . i brushed it off , thinking it was simply something in the corner of my eye . then , it happened again . the next time i used my ability , i noticed it again . some sort of fast movement , this time not in the corner of my eye but in the middle of a field off in the distance . i had used my power whenever i needed alone time alone , and by time i mean real time , time that had nothing moving in it . time that was pure , clean , and untarnished by the constant bustling of mankind , or the universe in general . whenever i used it , it was far from a localized event . all across the universe , everywhere in existence , stood still . and there i was . newline newline it was nt like you would picture it , i did nt just walk around and do random things , after all movement takes time when you think about it . i was just there , every thought in my head had no  time  to move or change , whenever i froze it there i was with the same attitude , ideas , and thoughts i had the instant i froze it . it usually was seamless , flawless  no difference could be detected in anything . as far as i knew , i was the only being in existence that truly knew the feeling of pure privacy , unhampered by the beat of a heart or the flow of motion . newline newline whatever it was , it did nt seem.. or feel.. human . every time it showed up , there was something about it that was wrong , and i knew it ... both of the most recent times i had seen the apparition were when i had used my ability near a field , or open place on earth . it seemed strange that something like that would be restrained to certain spots on earth , which was so easily forced into submission by a person like myself . it made me wonder , was i the only one who knew of my ability , or was there somebody who knew how to counter it or even harness it ? newline newline after the fourth time i had caught a glimpse of the thing , i was sitting in a coffee shop in a lonely little town out in the middle of farm country . everything was bustling along as intended , had time been passing normally it would have been nearly a billion years since these people had last had a heartbeat . the small , dusty tv was hanging in the corner of the building right above the other end of the bar from where i was , blaring its usual bogus out to the entire establishment at a volume that was kept at a constant  just loud enough  simply because nobody wanted to get the ladder out to change it . newline newline suddenly , there on the tv , was a familiar sight . of course , the whole planet was familiar to me , when time is on your side you can explore wherever you want for however long you want , and i knew every place at least a little . there , on the tube , was a  breaking news  report with some high voiced newscaster woman speaking over the title that spread across the screen . newline newline  strange sign found in crops  newline newline the camera , suspended by a helicopter , panned over a strange symbol carved into a corn field . all three patrons of the shop were whispering among themselves . according to the newscaster , it seemed to have appeared suddenly and randomly , just like three others nearby . newlinethe last of us were free . escaped . the bleak desolation of that place was behind us . no more blistering heat and constant hunger . we were moving on to the promise of blue skies and green grass and ocean waves and cool breezes . every moment , the existence we fled seemed more dreamlike . with luck , it would soon be a barelyremembered nightmare . for the first time in an eternity , there was hope . newline newline the captain s voice came over the loudspeakers :  we would like to announce that hell is finally empty .  the system showed it was set for a global broadcast , transmitting across the entire empty planet . he always did have a flair for the dramatic ... although , that s a pretty fair description of earth these days .i shall be the moon , newline to cast shadows in the night , newline a pallid

were nt alone in this vast , vast universe . pretty damn far from it . so first a comet , then a horde of viscious aliens descended upon earth like vultures . we did nt know what to do . but then ... something changed ! it was like a switch had been flicked in our minds as instinct suddenly took over and we began to form armies of our own . vast , vast armies . the whole humankind race united against the unwanted , foreign invaders . america led the way , and the rest followed suit ... . newline newline  bravo bravo ! we re hit !  . they re screams rang in my ears like cursed bells . i would hear this sound for ever every time i closed my eyes to sleep . wave after vast wave of our fighterpilot ships were cut down like grass in the skies above earth . it was a mexican standoff and the humans were losing . i turned to the president . i do nt remember thinking or saying the words that came out of my mouth , for it was my dna talking . i have to go out there and finish this .  no  he said you re too valuable . we need you here for your strategy . you must lead us . what you re talking about is crazy ! it s a suicide mission . you ca nt go out there . we ca nt lose you , dammitt  . but there was no choice . we were losing precious men every second . i had to turn the tide . i alone knew what must be done , for it was hardwired into my dna . newline newline i went down to the hangar and put on my fighterpilot armour . i relaxed as i felt the cool embrace of my most loyal companion . i felt myself getting into the zone , as i thought about what i was about to endeavor to attempt . it would nt be easy . the president was right , it was a suicide mission but it was that or total human extinction . even if i died i d go down fighting , doing what i do best and inflicting as much damage as i possibly could on our alien enemies . they were nt welcome in our land and i was about to make that crystal clear to them . i got into the fighterjet and started the engine . with my hand on the throttle , i felt cool and in control . i tightened my grip and twisted , taking to the air like a bird . all doubts left my mind as my instincts took over . this was who i was , i was where i was meant to be , doing what i was born to do . newline newline a few minutes later i came upon the awful , terrible scene . the sky was lit up like the 4th of july , but those were nt fireworks . they were all my friends . their flaming jets were exploding , falling from the sky like fiery rain . i could nt let the emotion take over . i had to stick to my task . the world depended on me . taking a deep breath , i flew on . i approached the mothership , when a transmission came through my radio . at first i thought it was just static , but then i realised it must be the aliens endeavouring to communicate with me . i took up the microphone and let them have it  i m coming for you . you think you ve won this war but i was born to prevail ! you shall suffer , you shall burn and you shall dies like the unwelcome scum you are !  . i could nt understand their reply . maybe they could nt understand mine , so i let my guns do the talking . i fired to the left , then did a barrel roll and fired to the right . they did nt know what hit them . before they could regroup i swooped and hit the weak underbelly of their ship . sparks flew and explosions rang out . their ship screamed , as if it were alive and suffering personally . i looped back around , and aimed for the cockpit but my bullets bounced back like they were made of rubber . the aliens constantly fired at me , as they had doneto my comrades , but i outfoxed their attacks . my ship was small and quick , as i darted about like a wasp , stinging them where i could . suddenly their ship groaned and creaked . it was losing air , falling to the ground in a fireball . it crash landed and i followed . when i landed , i took out my knife and went over to their ship , eager to finish this once and for all . newline newline their captain came at me . he had five arms , all lighning fast . he struck me a hard blow on the head and i saw stars . i was about to black out but then something awoke in me . suddenly i was faster and stronger than ever . with my knife i sliced off one of the alien s arms , then another . he screamed in pain like a wounded animal . i advanced on him . he gazed at me with his red gleaming eyes full of vast , vast hatred .  you can not win !  he said . but he knew his time was up . i took a run up and leapt into the air . time stood still . everything was in slow motion . i swung with all my strength with my arm holding my knife and sunk it deep into his vast , hulking body . i buried the knife to the hilt as the life ran out of this horrible foreign invader . i collapsed . exhausted . broken . i began to black out ... newline newline after a spell in hospital i made a full recovery . at a press conference with the president i was celebrated as a hero . but i m no hero . i was just doing my job , following the orders of my dna . a reported turned to the president and asked him what had saved us .  two thing  he said  this brave , daring man before you

graveyard . newline newline too afraid even to look behind her anymore she willed her legs to keep moving , and ran to the cover of the trees . hidden amongst the foliage of a bush , she allowed

but the color of his hat . it did not look nice with the rest of his outfit , and it made him seem ... out of the ordinary  . newline newline i put on my glasses to see what he is typing , because i am a nosey sonofabitch . newline the words that were on the screen were in another language . it looked arabic , but i do nt have any idea what they could mean . the words came up on his screen ,  it begins raining outside , but with the light of the sun still shining through .  newline newline it befuddled me why he decided to write in english ,  maybe they do nt have those words in arabic . doubtful , but only thing i got  i thought to myself . newline newline almost instantly the rain came down . it was quite a funny coincidence , though i begin to notice more . it is also bright day out still . very coincidental !  newline newline i start to try to decipher the words he is typing , with no avail . and once in a while , he would type in english .  wind , laughter , horns honking , glass shattering ...  and almost immediately , after each time he typed , that event  happens . newline newline my wife was running late , so i decided to grab another cup of coffee , and read . newline newline it was ... amazing just to sit there and read ! but it was also disturbing . this man had the ability to either , see the future , or , type the future . i was nt sure ... newline newline  the man reading this will spit his coffee all over the table .  newline newline what ? !  i choke and spit my coffee all over the table . my goodness !  he has the ability to type the future . newline newline the waitress came over to my table and help clean up . and i thanked her . but when i turned back he was gone ! the man who i have spent the past hour reading , was gone . and almost

alright ? it s like you saw a ghost !  newline newline i smiled ,  heh , maybe i did ! lilah s quarters were dim and cold . to be fair , the whole ship was dim and cold , except for the workrooms near

him about an hour before we met at grafton notch . said he saw him right around the base of wyman mountain .  i continued to poke the fire , watching it dance . newline newline  i guess we ll see for

?  i asked , munching on some trail mix . i looked up at the sun , squinting . it rose over our heads , coloring and exposing the mist from the nearby waterfall . newline newline  we could , but maybe different stretches . if we re only gon na do fifty miles , then we should change it up .  ryan said , perched on top of a boulder , looking over the small waterfall .  how high do you think this ? thirty feet ?  newline newline  probably thirty five , forty .  i said , sizing up the falls .  i expected to see more day hikers . i guess tuesday is nt really a great day for people .  ryan hmmed in agreement and we fell silent for a moment . it really was a beautiful day . newline newline we decided to explore the bottom of the falls , and made our way down to the stream below . newline newline  kinda looks like a cave back there , man .  said ryan , studying the cascading falls . newline newline i picked up a rock .  let s find out .  i threw it at a weaker part of the falls perhaps water was deterred somewhere above by a boulder . it flew through , barely disrupting the water , and we heard a faint clang as it hit something ... metallic ? newline newline ryan and i looked at each other in bewilderment .  what the hell was that ?  he asked . we did nt need any more words , and looked for a way to get behind the falls . newline newline  you see that ledge over there ?  i said , pointing to the left of the base of the waterfall .  i think we can kinda get around it up there .  ryan nodded . newline newline ryan and i quickly made it up to the ledge , and from there realized it would be even easier than expected . we donned our rain jackets and left our packs a few feet back from the torrential downpour . it looked like a few foot drop would put us on a mostly flat , somewhat dry boulder . newline newline ryan went first , and i followed a moment later , jumping through the falling water , instantly soaked , but successful , landing on all fours , scrambling away from the water fall , reaching for dry ground . newline newline i coughed and sputtered , wiping my eyes , and heard a strange sound , a brief , high pitched whining noise . i looked up to see a gun pointed a few feet from my head by none other than han solo . newline newline my jaw dropped . to my right ryan stood , hands on his head , wide eyed and with a wookie bowcaster shoved in his face . chewbacca stood next him , towering over my 63  friend .  newline newline  hey kid . why are you throwing rocks at my ship ?  questioned han . then i noticed it . the millennium falcon lay behind han and chewie , just how it appears in the movies ... what the hell ? how is this real ?  newline newline i should have brought my camera . peter you do nt have to do this again ! stay home with me and watch the episode of homeland with me !  newline newline  you know i think homeland is just over sensationalized garbage written by the right to get us to buy into their islamophobic rhetoric ,  i

practically everyone has a autonomous vehicle these days . every rich 16 year old that used to pay the highest premiums now has a tesla model c.  i said as i screwed the cap on my flask and used the sleeve of my dark green old navy hoodie to wipe up the rum on the white countertop .  they are laying off people nation wide .  newline newline i grabbed my brown satchel and threw my green eagles

adjusted the seat in wendy s light blue toyota camry . newline newline  are we still on for tonight  i asked as i backed out of the driveway and turned down the radio . newline newline  yeah we got a

satchel . newline newline  i got it . send me the location and i ll be there shortly .  newline newline i drove around the block a couple times until i got a text from nips with the location . i copied it into google maps and was on my way . driving around at night without wendy usually gives me anxiety but tonight was really bad . i could nt stop thinking that someone was following me . every couple of seconds i was checking the rear view mirror to see if i was being followed . i swear a red pickup truck was trailing me at every turn and i could nt seem to shake him . up until the last left turn down the street the boy lived at the truck was just 100 feet behind me . my heart ceased to pound as hard once i saw the large white dodge caravan at the end of the culdesac and did nt see any one behind me . newline newline i parked behind the van , wiped the sweat from my bros with my sleave , and looked at myself in the rear view mirror to make sure i did nt look as drunk and sleep deprived as i was . i walked up the side door of the van , grabbed the handle and slid the door to the right . the door slowly opened and i saw all of the boys in their usual seats . there was tootles in the driver s seat , slightly in the passenger seat , and the twins in the far smiling with bloodshot eyes , and then nibs and curly sitting up straight in the captain seats . newline newline curly appeared on edge , he glanced up for a second to look at me and then went back to counting the money he had in a brown paper bag . his mop of blonde hair reflected the moonlight and produced a weird looking shadow on the top of the car . nibs looked directly at me with a large ziploc bag full of dark green shake in his hand and said ,  do you have the dust ?  newline newline  yes i told you i did ,  i snapped back at him . i wanted to get this over with as soon as possible .  do you want me to do the usual ? what room is his bedroom and are you sure he is asleep  newline newline  we saw the lights go off in his room an hour ago . the coast is clear , just fly up to the windowsill and prop it open and give him the usual spiel . we watched peter pan with him earlier so he ll totally believe the whole pixie dust makes you fly thing .  newline newline  alright . i am just getting a little worried that we are gon na get caught guys . wendy saw on the news that there are people investigating this matter and looking for us . i do nt want to go to jail , i ve spent one night there and it blows .  newline newline  look peter , the kid owes us hundreds of dollars and he has refused to pay us for 2 months . he may be our friend but he really has fucked us . we ca nt keep messing around if we want to be taken seriously as drug dealers .  newline newline  okay fine . i ll sprinkle some dust on him and tell him to fly with me like usual . i ll hold his hand and jump off the windowsill and as soon as he falls to his death you all need to get off your ass and clean up the mess on the driveway .  i glanced back at the stoned as fuck twins in the back .  i m looking at you two .  newline newline they laughed and slapped high fives . newline newline i swiped the bag of kush out of nibs  hand . ever since i got fired , i had to resort to tricking kids into thinking they could fly to help the lost boys hold their dealers accountable . i jumped high into the air and whooooshed up to the windowsill on the front side of the house . i almost crashed into the wall on the account that i was borderline black out but i could almost fly better than i could drive at this point . it was almost my 41st birthday so i m kind of an expert at this point . i flung open the window and gently floated down to the carpet . i turned around to slowly close the window behind me . newline newline i tiptoed over to the queen size bed , dodging a windy plastic racecar track and tiny metal toy cars that were flung over all over the room . all over the walls were pictures of famous nascar drivers . i really did nt agree with the lost boys  policy of selling to minors but i did nt really try to dissuade them . i tiptoed over to the queen size bed , flung back the covers , and saw a old man with a hook lying there with a m16 pointed straight at my face . newline newline  got you now peter ,  he said as he pulled the trigger .          dropcap  newline newline her life

discuss the specifics of project fanaday with those whom she contacted . after some time , her letters became less frequent . there was nothing to say , after all . no amount of break time watching online videos or reading world news could be a substitute for human interaction . that was what she missed most of all . the endless bustle of silicon alley , the cool of early morning outside a manhattan brownstone . the deli on 4th street where she d had her first date with paul . newline newline she missed paul . newline newline absentmindedly , she twirled her finger in the air . her reflection did the same . she wanted it to be enough . she , and her reflection , and the rain . it was meant to be the only comforts she needed . newline newline but every night , at 9 pm , the simulation ceased . the very idea of windows to the outside world refused to be , each screen recessing slightly before being shuttered into their hiding places . the speaker system left its

sleep each night . doing so will help the body ... newline newline she shut her ears to the voice as best she could , making her way through the dimly lit hallway to her bedroom . the bed was unmade , as disheveled and unorganized as the library , the bathroom , and lately , her various workstations . newline newline she felt the urge to rebel , to burn her entire laboratory to the ground , if only to gain one more precious second with paul and her family . but she quelled it , dashing her emotions as violently as she flopped onto her mattress . it would not be good manners to destroy her important work . newline newline perhaps tomorrow . i will lodge a request for vacation . perhaps it will not be denied again .  newline newline her nightly mantra washed her to sleep as easily as the summer rain . what did you just say to me ?  hank said , puffing his chest out like he and joey had seen the apes do at the zoo . he  d taken off work to go on that trip last month , used one of his coveted vacation days just to make sure joey had a wonderful day at the zoo . if that didn  t make him father of the year , then he didn  t know what would . newline newline  i said you  re a shitty father ,  michael replied , his eyes slowly climbing up hank  s torso before locking with his own gaze . hank had always hated michael , hated him since the day he found out his son had also bought him a  world  s greatest dad  mug . there could only be one , they both knew that , and they  d been in competition ever since . yet it was michael who had fired the first shot , selling his left pinky finger for tickets to disney world at the request of his sixyearold son aaron . he was such a showoff , such a selfrighteous bastard . where did he get off severing his own finger , just to spite hank ? he knew hank had a terrible phobia of blood , knew he  d never do such a thing . what a gradea asshole . newline newline  fuck off ,  hank said .  i  m a better dad than you  ll ever be.  hank flexed his puffedout pectoral muscles , or rather attempted to do so . it had been a long time since he  d seen anything other on his chest than a pillow of distended , flabby blubber , and was no longer sure he even had any muscle lying underneath . newline newline  oh yeah ?  michael said , lifting his fourfingered hand up into the air and wiggling it awkwardly close to hank  s face , his world s greatest dad mug hanging from his thumb . he knew just how to get him , just where to strike . newline newline  yeah ,  hank said , rotating his wrist and bringing it just beneath michael  s nose . he wanted him to smell the fresh ink stained against his pale skin , the words  world  s best father  written in cursive beneath a drawing of his son , joey , atop a flaming unicorn . he  d asked joey what he wanted most in a tattoo , and his immediate responsea flaming unicornbecame reality a few hours later . newline newline  what is that ?  michael said , staring at the stillbloody tattoo . newline newline  fresh ink ,  hank said , laughing slightly and adjusting his grip around his world s greatest dad mug .  my kid requested it . it  s permanent.  newline newline  that  s it ?  michael said , tilting his head slightly . he laughed softly before beginning to unbutton his navy , buttondown shirt . newline newline  what are you doing ?  hank said , watching as his paternal enemy undressed himself . newline newline  look.  michael pulled his shirt open the rest of the way , letting it fall down off of his arms like an eager virgin bride on her wedding night . his chest was completely covered in ink , a massive tattoo of aaron plastered from the bottom of his neck to just above his waist . aaron was wearing a clown suit , riding a surfboard out of an erupting volcano , with the words  fuck pokemon  stenciled across the bottom . it looked incredibly painful and unnecessarily colorful . newline newline  jesus christ ,  hank said , taking a step back .  you let him do that ?  newline newline  he told me what he wanted ,  michael said .  a good father does anything for his kid.  newline newline  oh , so you didn  t actually let your child tattoo you ?  hank said , unlatching his belt . newline newline  no ,  michael replied , staring down at hank  s slowly descending pants .  what are you doing ?  newline newline  now it  s my turn.  newline newline hank pulled his pants off the rest of the way , letting them fall to his feet in a crumpled pile of business casual . he stared down at his own legs , the mess of scribbles and lines cascading across every inch of his oncepale skin . it was the result of letting joey play with the tattoo gun for about a week straight , until he got bored and decided it was no longer fun anymore . newline newline  what the hell ,  michael stammered , staring at hank  s legs .  joey did that ?  newline newline  yes , with an old , unwashed needle ,  hank said , extending his hands out like jesus on the cross .  behold.  newline newline  that  s pretty good ,  michael said , his face suddenly changing from shock to amusement .  not great , but pretty good.  newline newline  what do you mean ?  hank said .  he used an old needle , i  m pretty sure i let my son give me aids just to make him happy.  newline newline  all i  m saying is that you  re a shitty father compared to me ,  michael said , throwing his buttondown shirt back over his shoulders and closing it up .  do you know where my son is right now ?  newline newline  no ,  hank said , pulling his own pants up , careful to avoid the dozens of open wounds and sores essentially covering his entire lower half .  that  s your job , you  re the father . you should keep track of your son.  he was such a shitty dad , didn  t even know where his own kid was . newline newline  oh , i am keeping track of him.  michael reached into his jean  s left pocket and pulled out a small , red device . it looked like an iphone of some sort , but with more buttons and sharper corners .  take a look.  he shoved the device forward . newline newline hank grabbed the object and stared down at it , the words  universal positioning system  stenciled across the top in silver lettering . the screen seemed to show a grid of some sort , with a large , green blip in the center . hank had absolutely no idea what he was looking at . newline newline  what is this ?  hank said , turning the device over . newline newline  ups ,  michael said , smiling .  it  s like gps , except for the entire universe.  newline newline  okay ?  hank said , handing the red object back to michael .  i don  t get it.  newline newline  my son always wanted to be an astronaut ,  michael continued . he glanced down at the screen , staring at it for a moment .  now he  s in space , living his dream.  newline newline newline  what ?  hank said , titling his head and taking a step forward .  your son is in space ?  newline newline newline  absolutely , anything for my kid . i built him a rocket and sent him to mars.  newline newline  are you insane ?  hank said , his eyes scanning michael up and down .  he  s going to die up there.  newline newline  some parents let their children make their own mistakes , that  s the sign of a good father . unlike you , i  m not holding my kid back.  newline newline  you  re an absolute monster ,  hank said , taking another step back .  i can  t be around someone as insane as you . you  re a terrible father.  he turned and began running back toward his house , his world  s greatest dad mug clenched in his fist . newline newline hank knew he was now behind in the rankings , that michael had beaten him out with his latest stunt . he needed to get home immediately and begin construction on his own rocket , to somehow figure out how to get joey launched to at least jupiter , if not saturn . yes , joey would probably die on the trip , but he d do anything for his sixyearold boy . plus , since aaron would already be dead , the competition would end there . hank would finish out on top and finally cement himself as the world s greatest dad . then he could get to work on recapturing his title as world s greatest husband . newline newline  newline if you enjoy my writing style , feel free to check out some of my other short stories  in my subreddit !   http : www.reddit.comrchokingvictimwrites the blood on my

gave me a coke and told me to go play outside . i reported him to the food safety authorities . it took a little convicing and a lot of explaining but eventually i convinced my father to go into business with me . he took my prospect , asked a lot of questions hand helped me flesh it out , then he took it to the bank . we went into business together , my father and i , as equal partners . we hired a young cook who did nt mind treating burgers as real food , not fast food , we redecorated the place and marketed ourselves by offering free sliders to people who got off the bus after work , before they had a chance to go home and have dinner . it was a great success . my idea worked . it was never about the money . newline newline that was me , at age 13 . i never really wanted to make

hepatitis b in june , and now she s up on the board .  newline  it s hepatitis c  , the marker writes on . numbers like hieroglyphs . newline  c , d , q , who gives a fuck ?  newline  look  , the squeaking stops .  i know you feel slighted and for that , i am sorry  . newline  slighted does nt begin to describe it !  , papers take flight from the desk , propelled by angry hands .  this is a betrayal . be . tray . uhl  , each syllable punctuated by the pointed finger jabbing the mahogany . newline  last month , you were up on the board yourself . and you were up on the board the month before that and the month before that . you know who did nt come harass me or mr. davis about it ?  newline  okay , miss hep c is a great sport . now we put people on the board for being great sports  , smug and sounding dangerous . newline  mr. davis puts winners on the board . sometimes they re great sports , sometimes they re sore losers who happened to be on a winning streak ,  . newline the implication hangs in the air and changes it . newline  i m going to ask you something . and before you answer , i need you to drop your hrapproved , topbuttonbuttoned , zen monk attitude ,  . newline  no promises  , replying through a tolerant smile . newline  how will this effect my access ?  newline  your access to what ?  newline  to what , you pinhead ? to the products . to the clients . to mr. davis . to a fucking source of income . what do you think i mean by access ?  newline  it s possible ,  . newline  i ca nt make a plan on possible  ,  . newline an upbeat knock on the other side of

you did the cobbler . thanks for reminding me . yeah , i think we ll pass on your endorsement of our wacky theories . we still think of you as the guy who sang funny songs . we re kind of stuck in 2001 , you know . newline newline hey , me , too buddy !  newline newline ok. well , bye . newline newlinei woke to a new pressure in my room . i have never felt a presence while sleeping before . as a child i have never thought there was a beast under my bed , but for the first time in my life , i know something is there . my logical mind tells me that i am silly thinking such things in the summer of my twenties , but the atmosphere feels ... spicy . as i lean over and look under , i see a shadow moving . newline newline  hello .  newline newline the single word knocked me on my back . newline newline  hhello  newline newline  i did nt intend for you to find me , so would you kindly go back to sleep ?  newline newline  what are you ?  newline newline the shade sighed .  it is a very complicated conversation you are asking of me , and i would prefer not tell you who i am .  newline newline  how do i know you wo nt hurt me ?  newline newline  truly , you do nt .  the voice came from behind me , and as i looked up , the shade was standing over my head . newline newline  are you a ghost ?  newline newline  in a sense , yes , but also no . i am the explanation of a ghost you could say . although , i am not dead . this is a very complicated matter , but if i where to say that i am here to protect you , would you believe me ?  newline newline  you have done me no harm , at most i can give you the benefit of a doubt .  newline newline  good . please go back to sleep . i need you sleeping .  newline newline  how could i sleep knowing you are here with an unknown purpose .  newline newline  i doubt you would understand , or feel any better if i tried to explain it .  newline newline  on the contrary , i would feel a lot better if i knew your purpose , and i would try so very hard to understand .  newline newline hesitantly , the shade says ,  very well .  he pauses for a moment to search for the words .  i am an entity from a 4 dimension universe . we can cross over to your 3 dimension world easily , but we scarcely like to do so . we are often called ghosts , wraiths or specters . how may i ask , do i appear to you ?  newline newline  you are just a silhouette , or writhing thick smoke .  newline newline  interesting . to me , you are flat like a painting that i can walk around . i see no color here . everything gives off a white light and different shades of gray .  newline newline i became very curious .  how is your 4th dimension perceived ? can you describe it to me ?  newline newline  it would be difficult , as i have only done what you have . i have accepted the world i have been presented with . could you described to me what a single dimension is ?  newline newline  i suppose it would be a single line or a dot to me .  newline newline  i suppose that is what 2 dimensions of space is to me . very well , i shall try . if you are to imagine sitting in this room , but all around you , you can see your self in the same room doing different things . you can very well walk to the next room on your own volition , but you will perceive all others fallowing suit . i understand you a have a book that speaks about a father s white house with many rooms ?  newline newline  i believe you are referencing the bible .  newline newline  yes , that sound familiar . i have seen it many times when i have been called a ghost . however , that seems to me like the place where i live . some may have seen my 4th dimension and wrote of it .  newline newline  then i feel i understand .  newline newline  i sincerely doubt that .  newline newline  then tell me of who you are and what you are protecting me from ?  newline newline  i still prefer not to tell you .  newline newline  please do .  newline newline  i am you . and i am protecting you from you .  newline newline fear has returned to my mind as i tried to contemplate the paradox before me . can a human mind comprehend such thought of seeing both a wall and a doppelganger of sorts ? newline newline the shade spoke .  i see that i have challenged your mind most vehemently .  newline newline  your voice still seems unfamiliar , yet you say that you are me !  newline newline  is sound not simply vibrations through the air ? the atmospheric density may be different as it travels .  newline newline  and what of this business that you are protecting me from my self ? am i to commit suicide ?  newline newline  no . you will be attacked . i have felt the urge to come here and protect you . one could say i am the positive from one room . while i am here , my opposite in another room is making his preparations to also come into this room and kill you . i am unaware of his motive , but i am standing firm as your protector , and he is just as sure to be my equal and opposite reaction .  newline newline i could not help but grow concerned for my guardian .  if he where to die , what would happen to you ?  newline newline  that is not a concern for you . please , go back to sleep . because all i saw and heard was nothing , i thought i had failed yet again . that meant going back to the first equation , to the labeled diagrams and to check if the circuitry did not have any unattached ends . it meant trying again and i was tired of trying again . resignedly my hand moved for the power button but then something appeared on the screen , the smallest of lights . newline newline the light grew , slowly and with tranquility . the eventual image was very blurry . no sound came from the headphones . i pressed in the audio jack but it could not go in any further . figures , human i could tell , moved behind the veil . excitement , i was excited . was this a person with poor eyesight or was there something missing from the device ? newline newline after some time , my hand moved again to the switch . i would find out the problem tomorrow , i was much too tired at the moment . but , by thunder , the blurred image sort of melted away and there was much crackling and then another image appeared , clear as day . only about two feet above the pink sand , i was hurtling towards a seafoam green ocean . i passed smoothed rocks and broken shells and i imagined a wind blowing in my ears . the ocean was near now , a stone s throw away , but i lifted off the ground as if flying suddenly . and then there was the disapproving face of a woman , and , still carrying me , she scolded me although i could not hear the harsh words . as we were turning to go back , the morning sun thawed away and the crackling came back and then it was midday , and i was alone in a leafstrewn playground , oscillating on a swing . newline newline three girls around age 12 soon came into view , their faces contorted with menace . one of them had a bucket of water and i was just gathering my skirts to get away when the water splashed and temporarily blinded me . the girls rushed off , i watched them when the water trickled out of my eyes and i could hear their witchly cackles even though i could really not . i looked at my small hands , shivering and shivering . newline newline the screen shook and fizzed and then i could see a lovely chandelier and a ceiling with obese cupids giving each other chase . a young man was on top of me . his tightly curly hair was messed up . i saw , next to us , an abandoned wedding dress and the hand that touched his face , my hand , had a ring on it . the man s skin was as dark as night and it shone in the early afternoon light with sweat . he had on a curious expression , both grateful and concerned . newline newline and then i was pacing in a hospital corridor , occasionally looking out the window , perhaps for hope and comfort , to a lake with gliding ducks . they were beautiful . they flew up to the late afternoon sky and landed back in the water without disturbing it . back and forth , duck and duck . the door to my right burst open , and the nurse beckoned with excitement , gloves drenched with blood . i could make out what she said silently : it s a girl . newline newline when the screen came to focus once more , the first thing i noticed was the orange light of sunset , caressing the elbow of a small child in his mother s arms . the image was nt as clear as the others but i could see all the faces of those who gathered around me still . an old woman was closest to me , her face passionate with grief . she held my hand and i hers . and then the darkness descended , slowly , quietly , and was complete . newline newline my hand pressed the power button and i remained in a slumped position for a while . newline newline newline newline newline hmm , im thinking of making this a novel lolhistory is written by the victor . history will alsways reflect what looks best . history , will say that humankind killed the alien horde . the real fact is , they killed themselves . newline newline when the telkel arrived at earth , they gave us one hundred years to prepare for a battle . the telkel were a warring species , but an honorable species . they needed not our resources , our technology , or our planet . to them , war was a sport , and they traveled the universe looking for species who could best them in battle . to this date , they had found none . newline newline the terms of the battle were simple : earth had one hundred years to prepare their weapons , and their people for a battle to extinction . earth would also come up with terms they thought were favorable , and fair , in how each army could fight , and to what the winner would hold . newline newline for almost a century , earth s most powerful nations pooled their resources and their minds , trying to create weapons and vehicles capable of destroying the telkel . advancements were made in every industry , medical research bloomed , self sustaining power sources were created , weapons from what seemed like science fiction were created , the list went on . after 89 years , everyone concluded it just was nt enough . newline newline the telkel were too powerful . records from their first arrival proved how powerful , how lethal they could be . humanity had no hope of defeating them on the battlefield . newline newline in a last , desperate hope , one very unlikely avenue was approached . the telkel had told earth to also prepare terms that they thought were agreeable for the victor , and the battle . so earth , in a last shot , turned to the experts . for the last eleven years , 4,873 lawyers were given free reign to play with the terms . newline newline for eleven years these lawyers wrote in every clause , every loophole , every legal trick they could think of into one binding contract . this document was so large , it could nt practically be put on paper . an entire building of computer serves was built to house it . newline newline when the telkel arrived back in earth s orbit , and questioned our terms , they were met with three exabytes  or 3,458,764,513,820,540,928 bytes , roughly the equivalent of 750 billion dvds  of data . even using the telkel s incredibly advanced communication systems , the file took two and a half years to completely upload . it took another four years for them to contact earth again . they wanted to forgo the terms , their council said . it was taking too long to go though , to debate among themselves . some of the telkel wanted to just destroy earth out of spite , forgetting the terms and leaving earth a blackened husked . others wanted to stick to their code , to their honor , and continue working with the document earth had presented them . it was causing strife among them . the prime minister of france , acting president of the un , looked rather smug when he replied we would not negotiate the terms . newline newline nothing was heard from the telkel after that . the game , or globally allied militaries or earth , picked up more and more transmissions between telkel ships . their fleet began to separate , with half heading to orbit the moon , while the other half stayed in earths orbit . for two months this stand off continued . newline newline on august 7th , the two fleets attacked each other . both sides inflicted heavy casualties on each other , leaving very little left . it was a complete rout when the space fighters of earth attacked the surviving ships , ascending upon the wounded and damaged telkel fighters before they could recover . newline newline the telkel were never seen or heard from since . the celebrations went on for weeks , the nations of earth never have been so close to one another before . at the closing ceremony , the guest of honor , nobel prize winner stephen write , gave the speech dedicating august 7th as international lawyers day .  i know not if lawyers all go to hell ,  he said , inciting a few laughs ,  but without them , today , we would nt have own our bit of haven .  newline newline newline edit : grammar errors fixed .most people can count themselves lucky if they get the chance to go on a single real adventure . newline newline then again most people can count . newline newline my whole life has been an adventure . or at least so they say . i apparently have nt been  conscious for half of my life  . or whatever that means . some concepts are still hard for me to grasp . others are much simpler . newline newline whatever . i m just going to try my best to  assimilate myself into society  before they send me to the  loony bin  . i do nt even care if they do send me there . anything would be better than  living in the wild like a savage  again .i woke up normal like any other day , dreading for the day to be over . my small apartment still a cluster of dirty clothes and food wrappings . as drag myself to my bathroom , i look to the table seeing a calendar under the ashtray full of cigarette and joint buds . it s the wishing day . humanity s day to guess what they think makes them happy . i see people with their limited happiness as they usually enjoy and get bored of their materialistic wishes . luckily the wishes are limited to only effect the individual , so wishing to nuke the world was out of the question .  luckily  i look out the window with envy , wishing i could be happy with simplicity . wishing i could connecting with them , understand how they could smile . i think about asking for that , but i feel like it would just mask my true feelings of sorrow . i contemplate what to wish for  money ? nope a miserable man with money is still miserable man , friendship ? no the fact that the only way i connect to someone is if i wish for it is sad , a respectable career ? had i truly wanted it , i ve would done it as a younger man . i could waste the wish like i do every year , but i am sick of having this thought process . i sit there looking in the mirror thinking . then with a heavy heart i realize what i want , but a small part of me always knew what i wanted to wish for , a rope .tick , tock . newline newline earths space fleet was ready . well , the most ready they ever could be . newline newline decades of research had been poured in these topoftheline fighter craft . groundbreaking achievements were made on every front . a never before seen united human spirit was born , and every country participated the best they could , the most they could . newline newline in fact , countries were rarily named anymore . it was earth . not china , not the us , not europe , but earth . newline newline mankind had scrambled together 160 modern spaceships , 1405 satellite weapon systems , 2300 small spacecraft  basically guided scraps of metal with penetrating explosives  and a moon laser base . on the ground , hundreds of thousands of refitted space missiles pointed in every direction , connected to several computer networks to fire at one s command . millions of camera drones were spread around for the inhabitants of earth . newline newline it obviously was not enough . newline newline the last time they came , he had a fleet numbering in the tens of thousands . earth managed to bring down two robot craft , and that was because of friendly fire on aliens behalf . newline newline but the men would not go down without a fight . newline newline he had the decency to come at the agreed place to fight , at the agreed time . a portal opened and thousands of black ships poured out . a large mothership lay in the middle of this monstrous battlegroup . newline newline his voice boomed , and despite the vacuum of space , the space marine heard every word clearly . the alien leader captain ea spoke to them . for the alien , this was purely for profit . earth seemed to be valuable , he had said a hundred years ago , but he had not specified in what way . his army was entirely robotic . he controlled it and had defeated the defenseless earth inhabitants . but he had the honour of a fair adversary . he had given mankind 100 years to impress  him . newline newline it was on . newline newline the last time , mankind could not land a single blow to them . this was different ... newline newline somewhat . newline newline they traded unequally , losing five ships for one robot ship . but they could fight back . they were no longer the ants hundred years ago , but a small swarm of fiery raccoons fighting for their turf . newline newline the human fleet slowly shattered , and the robot fleet reached earth and started to face the satellites and the secondary reserve fleet , which was a ragtag of unfinished ships and defunct weapon systems . newline newline then , the command was given to launch the rockets . future historians agreed their effective combat potential was negligible , but on that day , everyone could see space lit up with the soundless explosions , the growl of mankind . the battle raged on fiercely for hours . newline newline it ended . space debris floated everywhere , from both sides . newline newline ea s voice boomed again , this time in a different tone .  well ... that was impressive indeed . you have honoured me with a challenge , and i deem your race worthy.  newline newline  this galaxy is a dangerous one . a never before seen threat is spreading over the galaxy . in time , both of us will be affected by it . perhaps in the future , we can be of assistance to one another . until then , fare well .  newline newline the robot fleet then retreated through a portal and disappeared . in its wake were floating hulls , technology ripe for the taking for mankind . newline newline   newline newline edited : advice taken from commentsfate is a hell of a thing , you never know what you are going to be endowed with . some are born rich and are born poor , some are destined to drag the world down as it shoot for the stars . i am the latter , i have burned more in my time than the inferno of hell . i am not a religious man but i know what hell is . newline newline during my infancy i grew up like a seemingly normal child , i had friends , some bullies and but at least it was normal . then my life changed the day my dad tried to show me what the lottery was . he asked me to scratch a ticket he purchased at the local 711 . he was occupied fiddling with the engine and changing the now grimy looking filth of the oil off of his hands . he handed me a penny from the cupholder and asked me to scratch the individual paper squares so he could claim his prize at the register . i used the smelly copper piece to wear away the thin film of paper covering the outcome of the ticket . i gave the ticket to my father and a look of brilliance flashed across his face , i had just won the lottery for our poverty stricken family . newline newline in the coming years my father , 58 , began to no longer look at me like a son , instead i was perceived to be a lucky rabbits foot to be used when he pleased . he , however , was a smart man  he made sure to not leave a crumb trail and cause suspicion . he never won used me to win twice in the same place . this meant that i was being dragged by my ears across the face of the united states in order to fulfill my fathers lifetime dream of eternal greed . you know , he always made an effort to pretend to like my company so that i would more willingly become a slave that does his bidding and does not question his command . i almost felt as if though it was genuine , he convinced me that life was not worth living if you did not have your father at your side and that i was meaningless without him . he never quite said this directly but i understood the message he was putting out . the worst part of this all was that i actually believed it . newline newline my life was slowly becoming an endless cycle of going from casino to casino collecting my winnings and practically trading my soul to make the only other human that i interact with happy , my mother died at a young age so you can narrow it down . i continued down this shitty , winding road for about 5 years until the men who followed our trail caught up . newline newline i was sitting in our rather nice camper , we did not have much to spend money on out on the road so we did when we could . in the beginning we had a horrendous  6,000 camper we bought with the winning from the lotto ticket i scratched , but with the money that we made during travel we upgraded to a luxurious beige traveling coach . during the time that i was sitting in the camper two things happened . first , i heard some popping sounds in the distance and some fairly eerie screams . second , my father came rushing into our bus with a pale face only offset by the blood streaming from his forehead . i ran into the driving seat and luckily the keys were already in the ignition , it was a short stop . the very next thing that occurred were the bullets adjacently streaming through the walls of our only means of transportation , someone wanted us dead . i looked into the back of the isle where my father was holding his side as the crimson stream made its way onto the floor . i knew that it was not looking good for his survival but i knew that i must try , he really truly was all that i had . newline newline then it happened , as i was looking back at my father as he was clinging to life a lone bullet pierced his still beating heart . the following explosion of blood and lung matter that sprayed the wall still haunts me . even if he was just using me he was still the only thing i had to live for , i was his companion and now i was nothing . i felt nothing , it was just a void of emptiness . then came the pain , i had the sensation that i was pierced by a thousand razor blades that protruded from every direction . i felt a sickening dizziness , one that brought me back to the days of my first rollercoaster or the first time i asked my first girlfriend to prom . this was not excitement though , it was a somber ping in my heart . i collapsed in the seat just as i watched the sun grow dim , and the sky grow dark . what a lucky life i have lived .once there were four brothers . gods . newline newline this was when the earth was very young , before there were rivers , or clouds , or mountains or volcanoes . the four brothers were spirits : djinnis . and they were bored . the earth was round and boring and nothing ever happened . so the four brothers challenged each other to a contest . the winner was whoever could make this boring , boring world more interesting . newline newline the first brother cut off his own hand and a tsunami of water broke forth from his wrist , cutting deep into the earth . and the first river was born . newline newline the second , not wanting to be outdone by his elder brother , roared loudly and slammed down his foot and the earth shook and broke apart and from the bowels of the flat lands the first mountain was born . newline newline the third , looking to the boring , grey mountain that had been made turned his shoulder and faced the other direction . he placed four of his fingers into his mouth , and bit them off one by one and chewed them until they were soft and mashed . he flew high up into the air , and looked down upon the land and he spat his masticated fingers as far as they would fly and wherever they touched they embedded themselves deep into the earth , and in moments a colossal tree had taken root and grown from the earth , until a great plain had been covered . the first forest had been born . newline newline the youngest brother looked to his elders , to what they had made . the rivers and the lakes . the forest and the bushes and the greenery . and the mountains , the great , static mountains . he bit off his tongue and chewed the red muscle and he flew high into the air , high , higher until he looked down at the very centre at the mountain . he pulled his chewed tongue from his mouth and rolled it into a ball between his fingers , like mincemeat . with one mighty swing he threw the ball down the very centre of the mountain , severing off the top and falling to it s centre and down into the very core of the earth . newline newline the land shook , and the mountain shivered , and from the severed crater at it s top spewed lava and black smoke . rising away from the arid planet as the lava rained down below . newline newline it scorched the mountain , leaving trails in it s flank . it reached the river thereafter , scorching away the beautiful blue liquids , turning them into a black muck . then it reached the forest , and so intense was the lava of that first eruption that as soon as the bark felt the scorch of it s arrival , it exploded in a wave of heat . the forest became a ball of red flame , the blackorange lava rolling through it till it was dead , and disappeared . the black muck lying over where the lush forest had once stood . newline newline the brothers turned on their youngest sibling .  you have destroyed what our own hands have made .  they shouted .  we have put our blood and flesh into our creations , and with your recklessness you have destroyed them .  they chased away their youngest brother , and in the deep night plotted against him . newline newline the eldest djinni , of the river , investigated what had been made by the conception of the red lava and his water and found something none of them had expected : glass . newline newline the second eldest went to the peak of the mountain and saw there the boiling lava pit in the crater , waiting for a sign from it s master to erupt . newline newline the second youngest , and to whom the youngest himself was closest , was given the task of tricking the youngest into believing he had been forgiven . and that is why to this day wildfires  for fire was first born of the lava the brother had made  so hate the trees they burn . newline newline the youngest brother brought him back under false pretenses . and his second eldest appeared from behind a rock , beat him up till he was black and bloody , tied him with a rope and flew him high , high above the mountain and dropped him into the pit . the youngest djinni melted into the lava , and his anger was so great that once more the young volcano erupted  but this was the what the first brother had been waiting for . he severed his own hand  for what was hand against revenge ?  and created another river , this time he sang to the lava and to the water and they obeyed him and they created together a desirable form . the second eldest brother , of the mountain , collected the youngest from the bottom of the pit , where the lava had emptied entirely , so great was his anger , so that all remained now was an empty crater and an angry , melted djinni : the youngest was now a thing of lava himself . an entity in the shape of a man made of viscous rock and angry fire . the brother burnt himself just touching him  but from those burnt fingers came some of most hardy trees we have today . any tree that can survive in a desert was made from the fingers that were burnt on the lava form of the younger brother  . together they flew down the mountain to the oldest brother waiting for him . and together the three eldest brothers sealed their youngest in a case of glass and whenever it was dark they brought him out lighten the way . a lamp they called it , made of lava . newline newline  newline newline hey guys thanks for reading , i actually had a great time writing this . if you did like this and want to read more check out rjakewrites

good video game . the fight began and soon newline newline  you will never defeat me !  the wizard shrieked .  you may kill my body , but my spirit will live on in the seven orbs of havinstia ! you will never destroy all of them !  newline newline the hero brought his rubber chicken down on the wizard and shouted ,  that sounds boring . i quit .  newline newline and with the hero s mysterious disappearance , the fate of the kingdom was sealed . a thousand years of darkness ruled the land , and misery spread everywhere . even worse , the narrator was forced to complain to the developer , a cruel man who did not take kindly to criticism . due to this , his employment was terminated all cause of that fu newline newline thank you for playing . agent doyle , do you understand your duty ?

postreview been pardoned of charges  the legal system did not like making mistakes , much less having to fix them . but presiding peacekeeper hobner , who had officiated the trial , had been found to be corrupt , and was sentenced to 1000 years himself . at which point , all of his recent cases were reopened and reviewed individually by supreme peacekeeper jowett , head of the office of the peace . newline newline all of his cases had been cleared as proper judgements , but jowett determined that this case lacked evidence suitable to convict the defendant of any charges 15 years ago , so they were forced to issue public apology and issue the first order of retrieval  pardon since the new justice system has been developed . newline newline 2230 hours , time to depart shortly .  agent doyle had prepared himself , however begrudgingly , because he was loyal to the continents , and firmly believed in the new justice system . he was a top field agent , with a great number of commendations ,

across his view : judicial proceedings sealed  insufficient clearance newline newline strange . even without knowing exactly what he was alleged of doing , i still do nt feel comfortable bringing this guy back knowing that he had at least been convicted of 3 counts of willful lifetaking ...  newline newline agent doyle rented a vehicle , still surprised at how different everything was in this year compared to the 25th century . cars did nt fly or hover . people walked and rode  bicycles  . travel was lengthy and cumbersome , as they had not yet discovered warping , much less have access to any kind of time travel . newline newline he eventually came upon a house . a nice house . a man was outside tending to his lawn and his garden . the sun was shining , there was a cool breeze in the air ... a nice day . newline newline doyle parked his rental vehicle on the side of the road , lightly rubbing the tires against the curb . wheels  i ll never get used to them .  newline newline he got out , closed the door , and reviewed the information again . the file picture was locked , which doyle could not understand . he began to walk up to the man , badge at the ready . newline newline  sir . i m going to have to ask you to come with me . my name is agent  at this point , the man turned to face him . newline newline  doyle ! ,  he cried out , with a malicious grin . newline newline as he approached , he began to recognize the man . the man he knew was 23 years old , and john smith was nearing 40 , but the resemblance was uncanny . newline newline  you ? ! i have to bring you back ? ! wait how ... how do you remember my name ?  doyle s face clearly showed pain and anger rising behind his usually calm demeanour . newline newline  oh come now . i m hurt . you do nt think i could forget your name after i slaughtered your family , do you ?  newline newline  newline newline edit : forgot how to grammar in some spotsthe half smirk on my face is nt even deliberate , it s just there because i m the king . like the s  p 500 , my state of mind is at an all time high . the phrase  i m awesome , done  keeps going through my head on repeat . my shirt is fucking unbuttoned all the way down , or maybe just halfway , but i m way too cool to check . this bar is my bar , this night is my night , and i m going to order my favorite drink . then i ll take home the girl of my choice , we ll fool around all night long , and she ll make me eggs and bacon tomorrow morning while i admire my muscles in the bedroom mirror . newline newline the bartender here knows me , loves me .  skip , i ll take the usual ,  i say , and the three cameramen around me rush to capture the scene from unique angles . the patrons of the barrelhouse flat must be stunned with genuine awe . not wanting to come across as too haughty , i casually pull a toothpick out of my shirt pocket and hold it lightly between my lips while pretending to stretch . one of the guys who played james bond , or maybe it s james franco , is standing behind me , afraid to order his drink before i ve gotten mine . newline newline when skippy returns with my order , i know my moment has arrived . with the old fashioned , the man s man s drink of the century , now in my perfectly manicured hand , i turn from the bar to survey the scene . knowing there will be at least five furtive glances from lustful young women , i replace my half smirk with something serious and sexy . at one of the tables , a family is giving me a funny look . that s weird , i think . then the lincolnwood senior living home comes into focus , and i recognize all the trappings of easter sunday lunch . i m an 82 year old man , and my dementia has played me for a fool for the second time today .i ve waited 15 years for this very day . today , i start my teaching job at my old elementary school . whenever i told anyone my reasons for coming back they would always laugh and call me crazy , even my closest friends . but today , i ll prove them wrong . today , i will finally see what s actually on the mythical ,  fourth floor  . there had always been rumors circulating about it , i even overheard two 3rd graders talking about earlier . back when i went here , everyone believed there used to be a swimming pool up there , but after a younger student drowned they decided to close it , and now his ghost haunts the school . my older brother claimed that the teachers slept up there , in strange , coffin like beds . all i know is that there s something there , something that needs to be kept hidden . now , i would finally be able to solve the mystery for myself . newline newline i stood in front of the tall , ominous door that led to the 4th floor . it was a heavy steel door , something that belonged in a high security prison , not an elementary school . the door made a heavy thud as i unlocked it , and slowly , i pushed it open . newline a gust of cold , heavy air flowed out of the room , followed by the distinct smell of old books . i flicked on the light switch and the florescent lights lit up one by one . newline newline i could nt believe my own eyes , on the fourth floor there was nt a swimming pool or coffins , but rows upon rows of file cabinets stacked up to the ceiling . there was only one thing that this could be . on the fourth floor of my elementary school , permanent records were stored . at first i doubted it , there was no way such a place could exist . but after a little searching i had found my name . it had everything in it , there was a write up about the time i had shot chocolate milk out of my nose at my teacher , it had all of my old tests , all of my projects , everything . everything i had done was carefully recorded and preserved , and locked away for the ages . newline newline do what you want with this information , you can choose to believe it or not to , i honestly do nt know if i believe it myself . i do nt know if there s something like this at every school , but i do know there is something . the secret basement , the hidden door , the fourth floor . every school has its legends , its up to you to find the truth .i charged into the doctor s office , cut and bruised , with my arm broken , and blood trickling down my nose . newline newline  jesus , raphael ! you look horrible !  the doctor and nurse rush to my aid as i collapse on his chair . newline newline  hello , doc . hello , nurse .  they begin to clean me up as the nurse injects me with morphine . the pain goes away nearly instantaneously . newline newline  oh god , how did i get myself into this ?  she begins weeping while throwing out the syringe . i ca nt blame her . this situation has gone completely over our heads . newline newline  i ca nt keep this up . these wackos are too much . the chaos they ve caused has nearly destroyed the place . i shudder to think if they were to be let loose on the city .  newline newline  you need to continue .  the doctor said . his german accent was difficult to discern sometimes . especially if you had just taken a hammer to the noggin .  if ze higher ups knew zat ve let zese beasts out of captivity , zey d kill us all .  newline newline  they do nt know that yet , otto .  i said through my teeth .  not unless you told them .  newline newline  i told zem nosink !  he screams , throwing down the gauze . the nurse picks it up and starts bandaging my arm . she was always very nice to me . newline newline  what would happen if we all left ? just the three of us ? we do nt even have to tell tp about the escaped creatures .  newline newline the nurse had a point , the ceo wo nt be back for another week . i had been ready to turn in my badge for a while now . this studio has done nothing for us except cut our pay and increase our hours . no job security was worth this . newline newline  what do you say , doc ? want to go with the nurse and leave ? these monsters will destroy the place , run off , and then it s the federal government s job to take care of them .  newline newline  ve had a job . it vas you who let ze creatures out in ze first place ! ! !  newline newline i pulled out my revolver and shoved it into the doctor s face .  tp had me guarding the creatures with a fucking net . he does nt care about us . i had to buy this piece of shit from fucking walmart . do you think he wants them caged up ? no . there s a reason he was so quick to leave for vacation so soon . he wo nt be back next week for work , he ll be back next week to collect the insurance money once those three have burned down the entire place .  newline newline  how can you know zis ?  newline newline  i found them .  i slammed a pile of papers on doc s desk . the nurse started rifling through them . newline newline  these ... these are insurance forms . thaddeus took out a huge insurance policy for the lot !  she started crying , collapsing onto the desk . newline newline  doc , you know these beasts . you ve been trying to evaluate their mental state for a while . are they capable of anything else besides chaos ?  newline newline the doctor thought long and hard about this . he started digging his hands into his bald head , like he was trying to pull out an answer from his brain . newline newline  no ... zey have no hope .  newline newline  then we have no other choice . we got ta leave this place behind . these things can conjure up practically any item from seemingly nowhere and use them to destroy anything they want . if the us government ca nt stop them , nobody can .  newline newline  so , what ? we just leave ?  the nurse s makeup has run down her face . newline newline  that s right .  i pack my gun away .  plotz has given us nothing , and asked everything in return . i say we let these creatures destroy the place before they kill us all .  newline newline  so vere vill ve go ?  newline newline  anywhere else but here .  i say , straightening my tie .  i do nt care who deals with them , but it wo nt be me anymore . let s see if someone else can stop the warner brothers and the warner sister . draft . edit . revise . newline newline dan was slaving over his culminating . he knew that he had

expressionless faces of reporters from around the world . newline newline looks like no one has told them anything yet .  newline newline  good afternoon , my name is marshall broadwing and as many of you know the first images of pluto have been captured as part of mission new horizons , a project , i must admit , surrounded by controversy at its usefulness in understanding our solar system . however   newline newline many reporters near the podium stood up straight as i paused searching for the right way to address this . no one had expected what we found , not even the most extreme of disillusioned theorists . newline newline  i ... well , we want to be certain again that it is clear that this is only a report upon first glimpse of the photographs . our first viewing  newline newline i could tell the picture was now being projected on the screen behind me as a chorus of gasps filled the room almost in unison . newline newline  we ve concluded that there is no possibility that these markings we ve spotted near the pole of pluto are a mere coincidence . it seems that an ... intelligent life form  newline newline as the next picture appeared , a low rumble of murmurs filled the room . newline newline  intelligent life has left traces on pluto , and as it appears to our ...  newline newline   that s a penis ! !   newline newline immediately the crowd went frantic , reporters yelling in reports to their teams in an effort to be the first to report on what could only be described as the greatest story in our galaxy . newline newline  yes , it appears to be shaped as a crudely drawn picture of a , well , a penis . it also appears the rest of the cratering and markings around it are no coincidence , uh ...  newline newline a third image appeared behind me , this time even i could not resist another glance at it . newline newline  in all honesty , it really was quite glorious .    http : i.imgur.comgnt63zc.jpg the pencil was sharp , but not sharp enough . dave knew it had to perfect and no less , the overlords demanded it . newline newline newline dave wished for the days before the coup occoured , when a dull pencil did nt mean death , but things had happened how they happened and the perfectionist party was now in power . newline newline newline he tested the tip on his finger again , it broke . too thin . dave looked over to the administrator and breathed a sigh of relief  the administrator was busy imprinting a mark on one of his classmate s arms . the two marks on dave s arm were still in the process of going away . dave would need another week before they disappeared and the threat of a third would go with them . he continued to sharpen the pencil . newline newline newline after turning the sharpener a few times the pencil came out as perfect as can be . satisfied , dave returned to his desk and continued to write his essay . he tried to ignore his classmate being walked out of the room by the administrator . newline newline newline  only perfection survives  , dave thought , a phrase he was forced to repeat every morning , a phrase he had only just started believing .he turned , looking back towards the city . it gleamed bright , looking pristine and whole as the day he first came . he could see where his path crossed into that land , and followed it all the way to where he stood . out of his pocket , he pulled the small device , cylindrical , capped by a soft red button . to no one in particular , he whispered ,  i will not be one of your hollow men . but now , you face judgement .  he pressed the button , watching the city bathe in flames . turning once more , he walked along the path into the twilight . as he walked , the wind kicked up sand , forcing him to wipe his eyes as he went .darkness envelops me . newline newline my fingers tingle with excitement . newline newline i grip my bat with fierce strength . newline newline i slink up to the side of the house . newline newline it s dinnertime . newline newline the family is sitting down , hands clasped , in prayer . newline newline i look at my reflection . a mask agape with fear stares back . newline newline i m filled with excitement . newline newline i swing my bat at the window , shattering it inwards and glass tinkles onto the wooden floor inside the house . newline newline the family jolts up in unison . newline newline  oh crap , everyone sit down , i ll , uh , i ll get a broom .  says what i think is the father . newline newline i hear his footsteps thud into another room . newline newline i run around the house to a door and try the knob . newline newline it s open . newline newline the father is looking into a closet in the kitchen that is next to the room i ve entered . newline newline i exhale shakily . newline newline i walk up behind him . newline newline he spies my shadow , and turns . newline newline he does nt say a word . newline newline i ve got my hands around his neck . newline newline  uh , guck . . . helbeth . . . b  he gargles uselessly . newline newline his body falls limp to the floor . he called for beth . she did nt hear . newline newline the family is quietly talking at the table . i can see the mothers back from the kitchen doorway . newline newline i open a cabinet and reach for a glass . i firmly grip it and walk back to the doorway . i look for a possible exit before i move . newline newline there s a door that leads to either a closet or a basement to my right . newline newline i let the glass fly through the air and it hits the mother in the neck , shattering around her head and leaving a few pieces on the table , floor and in her neck . newline newline she screams in pain . newline newline i let out a quiet chortle and open the door to my right quietly , and slip in . newline newline it s a closet . newline newline the family moves as one to the kitchen , and find the father lying on the floor . newline newline the mother drops to the ground and sobs . the child runs to his room in fear and two other elderly women start panicking . newline newline the elderly women leave the kitchen and walk to one of the rooms to probably find the telephone . newline newline i ve cut the cords . newline newline i walk to the back of the closet and kick down the door . newline newline the mother recoils and starts wailing . newline newline i repeat her name over and over again , hopefully shocking her . newline newline i m really excited . newline newline i let my bat collide with her jaw and the crunch of bone against wood is so satisfying . newline newline she s unconscious . newline newline time to play cat and mouse . newline newline the two elders are in the other room , probably locked the door . newline newline i run upstairs . newline newline i call out for the little boy . newline newline i hear him crying . newline newline i find him hiding under a blanket in the corner of his room . newline newline he was quick and easy , his head was so small and weak . newline newline i move downstairs and the two elderly women have run outside of the house . newline newline my heart quickens and i sprint outside , catching the two of them . they are small and fragile . newline newline i tie them to chairs next to the fireplace in the dining room and assemble the bodies around them . newline newline i get gasoline from my car that i brought up here . newline newline the house is in flames . newline newline i am satisfied . newline newline i had fun . newline newline but , i ll get bored again . newline newline i ll have to repeat the process . newline newline repeat . newline newline repeat . newline newline repeat . newline newline repeat . newline newline repeat .a lone adventurer groped for yet another handhold . he was almost there . his left leg slid to find another foothold . almost to the city in the sky . although city in the sky was a rather misleading to it  s true appearance , a chunk of land being held up by four immense stone giants . the adventurer didn  t care one way or another what it was called so long as he made it to the top . if the legends were true , the adventurer knew that he would become the greatest man in the world . on one hand , he could find an infinite army which did only his bidding . or he could find immense mountains of gold coins . and it was all hidden . hidden in the city in the sky . newline newline finally , with three feet to go , the adventurer reached the top . his body was aching with both the pain of his unfathomable climb and anticipation for what riches awaited him at the top . he pulled himself upward , almost slipping on the sudden sensation of long grass at his fingertips , only just barely managing to roll up instead of falling back to the ground and his end . the adventurer lay in the grass , taking deep breaths from the surprisingly rich air . similar heights made the air barely breathable , yet there was some magic about the place which made it so . newline newline with his strength regained , the adventurer stood up and yelled to the world . he had accomplished a task of legend and he was about to acquire legendary rewards for it . surely the stone giants holding up the city in the sky were now his to command . he strode through the dry overgrown grass onto a cracked street . once it had been a road of perfectly sculpted stone slabs , but now moss grew where there once was grout and the stones were uneven and cracked . the adventurer covered his eyes as a sudden gust of wind blew clouds of dust into the air . he wandered through the open , albeit broken , streets , careful not to get himself tangled in the piles of broken glass or mountains of rubble . the adventurer was now starting to feel the air no longer as rich , but heavy . this city he climbed his way to was no land of infinite wealth . he gazed up at the faces of the colossal giants . once they must have been solemn and graceful , but now they were cracked beyond recognition . newline newline now the adventurer realized the truth . the legends were nt true . there was no city in the sky . the giants bearing infinite power on their shoulders was a lie . all they bore was death and failure .radio strasbourg . newline newline that was bazar et bemols . you re on radio strasbourg for this friday alloween . and in five minutes as announced yesterday , our distinguished guest ebenezer scrooge enters to discuss his colorful  views on halloween . newline newline the ad break lasted for five minutes . newline newline good afternoon strasbourg , hugo jean here to interview monsieur scrooge . welcome  newline newline hi  scrooge dished out a typically somber response . newline newline how have you spent halloween thus far ?  hugo went straight on the offensive . newline newline well , nothing of note . i had my eggs benedict at the berlin mansion before catching the train for this silly idea of an interview .  newline his tone was smug and satisfied . newline newline hugo ignored the criticism . newline newline when you were younger , you must surely have witnessed trick or treating ?  newline newline scrooge took a long sip of water . newline newline i never joined in . it s stupid and sweets are terrible for you ... newline newline it was at that precise moment when the studio lights switched off . newline newline hugo was very vocal in his unrest : newline oh my goodness , what s happening ?  newline newline the grinch appeared , covered in green fur . newline newline oh scrooge , embrace halloween ... .or you ll end up like me .  newline newline the darkened room filled scrooge s heart with a frantic violence as the glow of the grinch faded . newline newline here ebenezer , have a pumpkin .  newline newline the light flicked on the moment scrooge grabbed it , as the lead singer of bazar et bemols smiled through the green . newline newlinethere s a monster in my room . newline newline or not my room , but the room that i happen to live in . it is a small room with pink sparkles that dot the walls and a chest in the corner that hold the toys of the small child that currently sleeps in this room . a nightlight shines softly a corner , keeping the darkness and nightmares at bay . it is the shape of a cheerful little fish with blue scales and big , happy eyes . it seems to be saying  hey ! no monsters are allowed here ! beat it !  if only it worked . newline newline from under the bed , i hear something shift in the closet . the weak light of the night light is just barely enough to illuminate it . peering through the crack is a dark blue mass of fangs and claws . a single piercing grey eye stares out from within the shadows . it is smiling , and light reflects off of its long , sharp teeth . it stares , almost amused at me , and i hold my ground staring back . newline newline two monsters in a room , fighting over a little girl . every night when she sleeps , i will come out of my spot under the bed and he out of his in the closet . we stand in opposite corners of the room  i next to the toy chest and he against a pink dresser with disney princesses painted along its sides . in this lighting , it looks like jasmine is giving him a scathing look , and i smile to myself . each of us dares the other to attack first , and see who will come out victorious . what we are fighting over is control of her dreams . newline newline children are clay . they are soft , fragile , and easily molded . they are filled with unimaginable potential to do good and evil . children are most susceptible to ideas and thoughts in their dreams , where they wo nt remember where an idea or concept came from . it will sink in , and become a part of them . so i and the other monster fight every night for control over her dreams . he is much stronger than i am , but i am clever . we are both silent . the battle last on average two minutes , with us quickly slashing at one another , trying to inflict as much damage as possible . at the end of the two minutes , one of us is too drained to continue , and we wait for the next night . the victor sinks new thoughts into the child s mind , and throws out those we do nt see as necessary to their growth . newline newline we are both hideous and scarred from the fighting , and both think we are doing what is best for the child . he believes she should be free spirited , uncaring , and follow every temptation . i think that she should be composed , reliable , and down to earth . not all of his ideas are terrible , not all of mine are brilliant . but we know for certain that the other is wrong in the way they mold the child . all i can do is hope that what i am doing is correct , and pray that he does nt do too much damage on the off chance that he is triumphant .in the darkness of the cave i sit and await my final battle , and final fate . it has been centuries in the making , but alas i am the last . it was nt always this way , no indeed at one time my kind were as numerous as the sands of a beach . that however was before they came , that was before man appeared . there were those of the ancient council that wanted to immediately wipe them from our precious lands and shores . they wanted to make war with man and obliterate the species before they could spread . those of us back then that desired peace with all of those we encountered , objected to such a harsh and cold action . we argued that surely we could find common ground with these new creatures , as we had so many others . we were so very mistaken . where as other species learned to adapt to our continent and environment , man destroyed all in its path to adjust the land to its needs . where as we cherished all live from the tiny sprite that awoke the flowers , to the giant dragons of the fire mountains . man , well man only cared for itself . entire species were lost in such a short time , in a few short decades the council had shrunk already . again the more warlike of us urged for war and death for all mankind , and again so foolishly those more peaceable among us argued for peace . newline newline one hundred years passed , and my kind endeavored to make peace with mankind a reality . we befriended them , taught them our ways , shared our magics . for all our kindness and friendship , we were repaid with betrayal and death . we were enslaved , and dissected . we were hunted to our numbers were so very few . we met again with the ancient council , of the one thousand members now only six remained . six races were all that were left of our once great unity and civilization . my kind were finally ready for war , finally ready to face harsh truths and remove man from our home . however , it was already too late . there were no remaining warlike races to take up the call , and the six races remaining did nt posses the numbers for what was required . we decided to amass our magic and remaining power and relocate to a nearby large island . newline newline we moved , and we settled , we set up barriers that would let no other in . for a time things were good , we seemed to thrive and start to prosper once more . then two hundred years later , they arrived again . how they breached our barriers we will never know . how they found the heart of us so fast was beyond our understanding . never could we imagine a species so selfish and self absorbed , yet so driven and curious . the last council meeting was called , the empty seats burned into us more than any statement truly could . there were two of us left , two out of one thousand , and we represented only a handful of those two races . we discussed our impending doom , we looked back with clarity at our mistakes when it came to dealing with man . then a desperate plan was born , a plan not to save us , but to make sure we were never forgotten . newline newline we gathered the last of our people , magic , and power . we made a great sacrifice and created the ultimate weapon . it cost us all but the handful needed to carry out the plan . six of us were all that remained , six beings from millions . we went to the corners of their empire , and we released our weapon . wherever we deployed it , death and destruction followed for the humans . they called it  the black death  , we called it retribution . newline newline they found out it was us that had done this horror to them , and their hate was swift . over the last fifty years they have hunted down the other five , and now i alone am left . i hear them now , a band of them in their beaten metal they call armor . they will end me , of that i am sure for i have no magic or power left . i am the last , i await them . i await the chance to be reunited with all of my old people .well . there goes everything . mom . dad . the dog . my overpriced internet and cable bundle . the smell of the ocean . those tea kettles with the netting so you can make looseleaf tea . why me ? out of all the great people who just died a fiery , horrid death , why am i still alive ? i m just the person they hired to do a safety inspection on this space station . and now i m one of the only human beings left in the universe . newline commander dawes floated around behind me . newline  so what do we do now ?  i said . not that i expected a legitimate order . newline  well , what are your feelings on texas holdem ?  newline  are you serious ? should nt we be trying to contact any survivors or the other space stations ?  newline  we contacted china and russia . there were a few people on both . we re going to try to link up with them but it might take a while , our orbits are different . on a side note , have you ever had sex in space , major ?  newline i was slightly appalled but honestly i was too shocked at the previous events of the earth imploding to be offended . newline  well , i did nt have a boyfriend , even if i did he d be dead now .  newline  i left a wife and two kids down there .  the commander said . newline after a few moments of silence for our lost loved ones i repeated ,  so what do we do now ?  newline  we wait for the end . or shoot for the moon . whatever comes first .  he smiled , but i could tell he was terrified .from : mikiljacksun  gmail.com newline newline to : lilanne54  gmail.com newline newline hello gracious beauty !

newline newline it  s who we were . a proud race , an unstoppable force , speeding towards unknown knowledge . newline newline inability was simply a setback . newline newline our thirst was insatiable . newline newline eyes to the sky , we thrust forward , never regarding the turmoil of the aged ground , too enthralled with the uncertainty of the void , the unspoken promise of worlds beyond . newline newline in reality we were conquerors . our scientists were warriors , our politicians their divine rulers . newline newline machines churned through the sky , breathing fire and sparking the thirst within the hearts of hundreds of thousands . newline newline they called it a spirit of exploration . newline newline it  s who we were . newline newline when pyrex rolled out in the late 50  s , we had been on mars for almost thirty years . the company  s debut was ultimately our demise . a bullheaded entry into the market led to a public ip and a boost into the limelight . absolute domination of the spacefaring industry was ushered in with applause , everyone overlooking the clear monopoly that had been established . newline newline organized chaos ensued . pyrex had stakes in several genetics startups , with an extreme focus in modified organisms . their research was revolutionary , and coupled with the influence pyrex had to offer the implications were phenomenal . the dawn of altered respiration stock seed quietly entered the market without so much as a single protest . newline newline they didn  t know what hit them . while the world slept , the crops worked . on mars , the atmosphere became breathable , the plants taking to the soil and thriving in the hostile conditions . on earth , we suffered a severe loss . newline newline nothing grows here now . newline newline shortly after the epidemic , mars shut off communication . rather , it was pyrex that enacted the embargo , enforcing it relentlessly . they left us to rot , dying here with the stark clouds as our sole witness  even the sun turned its face away from our withered state . with no knowledge of the industry and no efficacy to generate the means of escape , our wings were clipped . newline newline a lone scout out on the freezing wastes might pass by the monolithic relic of progress . the scout would look for any sign of life here , this place that once gave us hope . he would find nothing . just dirt and grime and despair . newline newline this is our world , beleaguered by those that occupied the unseeable heavens . newline newline this is our world , a shadow of who we once were .the prison guard had given me his advice now , but i still felt sickly when the breathing clump of flesh , wrapped in a teddybear blanket was thrust into my shivering hands . newline it was frightening , suddenly . i could feel the heartbeat of the child , and i knew that if i held it close to my ear i would be able to hear its soft , whining , nasal breath over my harsh , anxious gasping . newline  kill the child , it s the right thing to do ,  he said .  you and your cellblock can survive . the minister only wants one sacrifice , and we both know that it will hurt fewer people if it is the child .  newline i moved to unwrap the babe in my arms , but the prison guard slapped my arm through the bars .  do nt look at it .  he explained ,  it ll be easier that way .  newline i turned around right away . i walked quickly and without hesitating towards the pit on the other side of the long hallway . i knew i needed to to it . i had to . it was nt a selfish act , i had to do it for the cell block . besides , it would be faster for this small thing than for my mates . newline i reached the pit on the far end of the hallway . this used to be where the administrators were going to put in a new furnace , to keep everybody in cell block 17 warm . when the minister came to power , that idea was scrapped . instead , he put the thing from the wasteland in it . the artificial light just below the security camera was deep enough for me to see the outstretched appendage of the thing . the other cellblocks had begun calling it the curse , the bottomless pit and the grand mercy , but we always called it the thing . newline we called the thing because that was as specific as you could get . it changed so often , but never for the better , so what besides malevolence could you ascribe to it ? newline i realized i had stopped . i breathed heavily still , and i felt my heartbeat in my forehead when i took my temperature . i wanted desperately to escape , to stop thinking , to stop worrying about such matters like this . newline i could see the veins in my shaking , tough hands . the labor of the factories had made them dry and calloused . i hated the minister with all my heart . i knew that eventually , if i survived , i might see the minister deposed , to see him beaten and bloody like so many of my cellmates were on occasion . the minister knew this too . he did nt care that he would die , he only cared that he could cause a lot of pain before that time . newline i knelt at the side of the pit . i saw the child in my hands . i let it roll , off my hands , into the pit . newline it did nt scream . newline i ran as soon as i could force myself to stand . i ran to the cell door . it was over . the guard was nt there to console me , though . i met the cold , dark eyes of the minister on the other side of the bars looked at me nonchalantly . his formal wear was visible underneath his bulletproof vest . newline  i hope you understand now ,  he said  that everyone must make sacrifices . you must sacrifice your personal sanity for that of your cellmates . likewise , i must sacrifice my only child to prove to you ruffians that there is something greater to strive for , and that everyone must be willing to make sacrifices for the greater good .  newline  newline newline three weeks later , a man with a rifle found the prison . a new leader , the son of a farmer , had found us , and after some tense negotiations between the cell block leaders and the farmer s tribe , he removed the minister from power , and cell block 23 beat the minister to death . i cried with joy . the final sacrifice had been made , for the greater good , and we could now proceed into the certainly rosy future .i remember when i got my first scar . for some reason , children aged 12 and under were exempt from the rule , and after i turned 13 i told my mom i hated her and that i wished i was never born . huge gash , right across the face . there was so much blood . newline newline my mom was devastated . she expected me to get my first few cuts like everyone else : lying about doing my homework , lying about cleaning my room , whether i was finished setting the table . but here was this 13yearold in the icu , bleeding openly like someone took a cleaver to his face that only cut skin deep . bone was showing in places , they tried to stitch me up but told me that my scar would be the worst they ve ever seen on a kid . newline newline i m 25 now . marked as a horrible person for something i said when i was still a kid . no one wants to talk to me . no where will hire me . i am truly alone . newline newline i never lied again .i grunted with excitement as i pumped my feet harder and harder until i fairly flew through the forest . trees seemed to jump out in front of me , but my reflexes allowed me to sidestep them instantly . despite my speed , my paws made virtually no sound against the soft grassy forest floor . suddenly , i burst into a small clearing that led right to a steep cliff edge . the moon hung huge in front of me as i stopped myself right at the edge and bellowed out an incredible howl that lasted for several seconds . finally , i sank to the ground , trembling with exhaustion and covered in a fine sheen of sweat . newline newline martin .  newline newline i jerked up and growled loudly as i twisted around . there was no one around me . newline newline over here , in your head .  newline newline i let out a long whine . oh , right . sorry . what do you need , elzaraath ?  newline newline remind me . why does the moon appear so much larger right now ?  newline newline it has do with the fact that it s near the horizon . it s just an illusion , of course .  my eyes hungrily followed the telltale heat signature of a cautious gopher peeking out of its hole . newline newline that s right , thank you . hey , if you would nt mind doing me a favor ... ?  newline newline ask , my friend .  newline newline dive into the sea below .  newline newline i peered down over the edge . the water was choppy and dark as ink . it is safe ?  newline newline yes , i ve found many delicious things in an underwater grotto not too far out .  newline newline that was all i needed . i crashed through the surface and nictitating membranes immediately closed over my eyes . tiny blips of heat flashed in my peripheral distance as some fish powered their muscles to swim away from my figure . newline newline to your left , about 15 degrees .  newline newline i jerked my head in the general direction and saw a rather large blob of white . i needed no more instructions  thrashing my limbs and tail , i swam toward it headily and felt my way through a tight tunnel . newline newline the tunnel will twist upward in about 100 meters . there , you can break the surface and climb onto the cave floor . food will present itself in plentiful amounts on the cave floor .  newline newline he was right of course , and soon i was slurping away greedily on succulent giant clams that littered the mud of the grotto . at first , i tried to use my claws wrench the two halves open , but found that it was far quicker to simply crush the whole thing under my feet . they were rich and meaty , and i scrambled to catch every last , dark drop of juice that fell from the shattered pieces of its shell . newline newline i hate to interrupt your feast ...  newline newline no problem .  i quickly grabbed hold of a squirming cave eel and crunched on its head . it fell limp in my claws . i imagine you had some reason of your own for directing me here .  newline newline you guessed correctly . i noticed it when i came here last , but of course i could not ponder it . tell me  what is all this light ? the ones that glow from the walls ? it is not the sun , nor the moon . it is certainly not fire , and i thought that they must be artificial  that is , electric . but i can not locate a power source  also , i am inclined to believe that no human has yet ventured down here .  newline newline i growled and crawled nearer to a side . you re likely right on that last bit  this cave is wellhidden . anyway , these are phosphorescent rocks  they probably contain zinc sulfide or something .  newline newline and why do you they emit light ?  newline newline i shrugged my massive shoulders and licked the wall . salty . not exactly sure . simply put , they absorb energy and slowly reemit it as light . the deeper explanation is probably a quantum mechanic effect .  newline newline ah , yes . you ve yet to explain that science to me .  newline newline someone has yet to explain that to me as well .  i fidgeted and clawed at the sand , digging for any little creatures that might have buried down here . newline newline such a beautiful world we live in , with its hidden surprises . anyway , i hate to make you feel impatient . let us return to the forest .  newline newline worry not , friend . any new destination in mind ?  newline newline there is a great weretiger that roams the eastern borders . he and i have fought on many occasions , mostly to test each other s strength . we are evenly matched it , and it is great fun . but i would love to watch the poetry of his movements in my current state ...  newline newline i roared with approval and dove into the water . newline newline  newline

merman for about a year , and no one really counts the years before you turn 20 . newline newline he looks around carefully , trying to hide his fair hair in the foam of the choppy waves . no matter how much he tells himself he s not looking for her , his tail twitches when he finally spots her ship , a few hundred yards from him . it does nt seem to be moving , so there s probably a research diver in the water . he makes a mental note to be careful . newline newline he thinks he s being sneaky , approaching the ship under the surface , trying not to disturb the water any more than the wind already is . he knows his tail sometimes glints and glimmers , the sun reflecting off his silver scales , but people generally dismiss that as fish . no one really believes in merfolk anymore , and they re happy to keep it that way . their lives are much quieter now . much less violent . newline newline he surfaces near the small observation deck at the back of the research vessel , thinking he s succeeded in staying out of sight until a voice cuts through the familiar sound of the rolling waves . newline newline  you know i can see you , right ?  newline newline his every instinct is

yeah , good job , he thinks . so articulate . newline newline he tries again .  i can talk .  smooth . newline newline  hey , cool !  she says with a smile .  learning a mermaid language would be a pain in the ass , probably . i d likely end up not even being able to pronounce half the sounds .  newline newline  how would you even learn one ?  he asks .  i do nt know much about the human world , but i m pretty sure you do nt have a whole lot of information on mermaids , let alone mermaid languages . that stuff went out of style centuries ago .  newline newline  i did nt really think it through , seeing as it only occurred to me after i found out you could , in fact , talk . we could have had an inspirational teachingeachother movie montage , i do nt know .  newline newline  what s a movie montage ?  he asks . newline newline she frowns a little . clearly , he s asked something stupid , and he s about to take the question back when she pulls a small box out of her pocket . it s in a plastic bag , and one side lights up when she presses a button . newline newline  it s easier to just show you ,  she says by way of explanation , completely glossing over what the box is as if he should already know . this whole encounter is already a lot to take in , so he decides it s probably magic and trying to understand it might make his head explode . newline newline the girl is tapping at the lit side of the box , and finally turns it towards him . there are images of people on the box . then she taps it one more time , and the people start moving , and he starts . it s definitely magic . newline newline  shit , i did nt even realise how weird that would be for you ,  the girl says , putting the box away .  let s just leave it at that .  newline newline  is it magic ?  he feels compelled to ask , because it never hurts to confirm things . newline newline  um , something like that .  newline newline he s bobbing along to the waves , trying to think of something else to say , when she speaks up again . newline newline  you know , i have nt told anyone about you .  newline newline he must look confused , because she clarifies .  anyone on the ship . they re looking for undiscovered life underwater , but i ve seen you a few times and you re always trying to hide , so i figured you did nt want anyone to know about you .  newline newline  besides ,  he adds ,  it s not like we re undiscovered life underwater , more like once discovered and relost .  he does nt say it , but he s grateful , and he hopes she can hear it in his tone . newline newline  how long ago was that ? do you remember much of it ?  she asks . her genuine curiosity is apparent , but he sputters , almost choking on seawater . which is embarrassing , because he s known how to surface since he was five years old . newline newline  how old do you think i am ?  he asks , slight indignation in his voice , and she blushes . newline newline  look , i do nt know , in all the stories the merman always has a crisis because the girl is like sixteen and he s entire centuries old and he thinks it s immoral .  newline newline  there are stories ? still ?  newline newline  that s the part you decided to focus on ?  she asks , laughing .  yes , there are stories . always with the age crisis , i guess they used to think it was romantic or something .  newline newline  how do the stories end ?  newline newline  usually , the girl seduces the merman into disregarding their age difference , and something magical happens and the girl goes to live with the merfolk and everyone lives happily ever after .  newline newline this time , he actually does choke on seawater .  that s ... that s not how that works . humans ca nt live underwater . that kind of magic does nt exist .  newline newline they ve been joking around until now , tones light , but his comment kills the mood . newline newline  yeah , well , your realism makes for crappy stories .  she shrugs .  so how old are you , then ?  newline newline  i m 21 . so there s no need to have a crisis . about the age thing , at least .  newline newline she looks to be a little younger than him , but she does nt offer her age , and he does nt ask . they both know it wo nt matter in the end , because it s like he said : humans ca nt live underwater . newline newline  what if i seduced you anyway ?  she asks .  completely independently of any age agenda .  he s a little bit impressed that she can say that and still keep a straight face . she s not even blushing any more . newline newline  it would nt be very difficult ,  he says truthfully , and she grins .  but ...  her face falls , but she looks resigned , like she knows what he s about to say . and she does . newline newline  but humans ca nt live underwater ,  she supplies . newline newline  it s already going to be hard enough to swim away from you ,  he says .  let s not make it any harder than it has to be .  newline newline  fine ,  she says with a sigh ,  you re right . you should probably go .  newline newline he surges up to kiss her , lips barely touching hers before he s gone , disappeared under the waves . newline newline it s only as he s swimming back towards the bottom that he realises he never even asked her name . newline newline newline newline newline   ot  :  i updated the prompt a little , i hope that s allowed ! this is my

newline newline newline  i followed you from afar . watched you grow , but accutely aware of any contact with your grandmother would get me treatment . so , even though it broke my heart , i stayed

allways people sympathetic to me , who snuck some in . newline newline the situation became more dire when the artists wanted to rule the world . because art can exist , but when it kills , new artists get born . they tried , but the specials fought them . it was not all understanding , it was more ... .. radical . anarchism against democracy . even the non artists had a voice , and this was mostly directed at the artists , who refused to police their own . in the end , your grandmother kept her head down . newline newline when your grandmother killed herself , it was plain to see . i saw her room back then . she , who was the godess of arrangements , and of getting things in the right order , failed at raising your mother . at least she believed that . it was plain to see for anyone who had seen her artwork before . i guess any artist meets his point where you cannmot go on like this . not that this is anything against your mother . it is more ... . imagine your world being defined by one thing . one thing that directs everything you do . you cannotz stop doing this thing , but if you do it , and it fails ... .  newline newline a shared moment of silence . newline newline an old , crumpled looking hand , with spots and thick veins , crumbling an old persons hat . newline newline  i allmost thought i loved her , you know ? i know that most of it was because i was in love with her arrangement of herself , and her arrangement of her surroundings , but she ... she was something special . newline newline so , what did she write about me , young man ?  newline newline a small sigh . newline newline  she calls you coda . that you were special as well.  newline newline a prolonged silence . newline newline  i see.  newline newline a further silence . newline newline  and now you came to taste the forbidden fruit ? to talk to a true artist ?  newline newline  i ... do nt know . why do you tell me ?  newline newline  i guess for missing all your baseball games and whatnots , i kind of owe you.  newline newline  i never played baseball.  newline newline a small sigh . a sad shake of the head , as if shooing away a memory . newline newline  what do you know about nerds ?  newline newlinedetective mcafee bent over the corpse , pushed the head to its other side with a gloved hand .  did someone hear his last words ?  newline newline the officer held a kleenex over his nose to hide the stench .  one neighbor heard them . she heard a scream in this apartment , followed by the body falling to the floor , and then the shout .  newline newline mcafee gestured , as if to say well ?  newline newline  the man said , the winds will take him , and then the calvian rocks .   newline newline  sheesh ,  mcafee said , sighing .  they just get more and more cryptic .  newline newline the officer led mcafee over to a coffee table in the apartment . meanwhile the crime scene investigators deposited a knife into a plastic bag , collected dna samples while wearing rubber gloves .  do you know what it means ?  the officer asked . newline newline  ca nt say yet .  mcafee found the coffee he d set down , sighing that he d left a brown ring on the oak of the end table .  when the death rattle prophecies started , they were very specific . the first one predicted that president shin zhin would resign , even included the year . we all know about that one . i heard one prophecy where a man predicted his own motherinlaw s stroke , by name . now they re cryptic , in vague language . they still come true , but we have to do a lot of interpreting . the winds will take you , and then the rocks .  who s him ?  newline newline  i do nt know ,  the officer said , looking down at the body .  this was a crime of passion . the wife shot him twice , shot herself once . there s no reason this man would have had any man on his mind at that point .  newline newline mcafee sipped his coffee .  that s the thing . the prophecies are nt necessarily about someone the person knows .  newline newline  the winds will take you .  a death ?  newline newline mcafee nodded .  if it sounds remotely foreboding , it means a death . most of these predict deaths , or tragedies in some way .  newline newline  calvin rocks ,  the officer said .  the silver cliffs northwest of town .  newline newline  yeah ,  mcafee .  that much is clear .  but   him   ? who was  he  ? there were ten million people in the city , half of them men . mcafee wrote the words down on his pocket pad while he still had them fresh in his mind and went back to the downtown office . newline newline erris , still at his desk , read them with eyebrows raised .  you think we should plant someone at the calvian cliff ? that s a popular suicide spot . three last year .  newline newline  could nt hurt .  mcafee shrugged .  but i m not thinking suicide . the wind will take him ? it sounds like it s out of the person s control . it sounds like an accident .  newline newline  well , then ,  erris said , handing mcafee the paper back .  if it s going to be an accident i do nt want to be posted there . take it to the lieutenant , see if we can get one of the new interns to patrol over there .  newline newline  real nice .  still , mcafee had to admit he would feel safer if someone would be posted at the cliffs . newline newline the lieutenant was talking on the phone when mcafee found his office .  no , honey . ca nt do lunch today .  he held a finger up to mcafee , who handed him the paper . the lieutenant read it with all his attention .  sure , honey . eggs , bread , milk , barbecue sauce . i ll remember . eggs and bread . and milk . what was the fourth thing ? okay . love you .  he hung up .  the winds will take him , and then the calvin rocks ? you take this to erris ?  newline newline mcafee nodded .  he thinks suicide .  newline newline the lieutenant leaned back in his chair .  yeah , my first thought too . you wan na stake out there ? just watch it for a couple of days ?  newline newline  not exactly .  mcafee sat down .  i do nt think it s a suicide . i think it s an accident . the winds will take him .  sounds like however it happens , it s out of his control .  newline newline  mm ,  the lieutenant said , sipping coffee out of a generic white mug .  you think it s another selffulfilling prophecy ? i send someone down there , somehow they end up being the ones who die ?  newline newline mcafee shrugged .  that s how paul lucas went . you remember ?  newline newline  of course . what were the prophetic words ? you , running from your doom , will find it .  then lucas got spooked , left the prophecy division , requested a transfer to traffic . where he got hit by a drunk driver during a routine stop .  newline newline mcafee nodded .  maybe we send someone down there looking for suicides , and the wind takes them .  newline newline  sure ,  the lieutenant nodded .  we have to be careful . just have someone check out the cliffs , though , would you ? just to make sure they re structurally sound . an accident could be anything . a rock falling from under someone s feet .  newline newline just then , someone tapped at the door . in walked a suited man , the local gambling magnate darren wynn . he was a supporter of the prophetic crimes division , having long decided to get on the good side of the law when it came to his casinos . newline newline  lieutenant ,  he said .  detective mcafee . sorry to barge in . i was hoping for only a moment of the lieutenant s time .  newline newline  that s fine , mr. wynn ,  the lieutenant said .  we re done here .  the lieutenant seemed eager to get mcafee out the door , but all mcafee could do was oblige . newline newline that night , mcafee went to the cliffs , careful to watch every step . there was a rusted guardrail there , but when he shook it it seemed steady . he read the park sign that detailed the history of the calvian cliffs , how once there had been a waterfall that fell all the way from the top . and now only bodies fall from the top , he thought . newline newline otherwise , everything seemed sound . there were no visitors to the calvian cliffs at night . they had a spooky reputation amongst the locals , especially after the suicides started happening . a few people claimed they were haunted , and some urban legends grew about the cliffs . the opening to the bay was far below , mcafee saw . we must be as high as a skyscraper . anyone who falls will definitely die .  newline newline but he found his car and drove home in safety . newline newline each death rattle prophecy had come true , usually within twenty four to forty eight hours . it had been only going on for a year or so , but the prophecies had been so accurate that the police created its own division . it was nt easy work . erris and mcafee only managed to stop one out of every five prophecies , and usually at the point where the prophecies were about to come true . but as they grew more cryptic , the prophecies became more difficult to prevent . in lucas  case , trying to prevent them only made the prophecy come true . i should have someone posted on the calvian cliffs ,  he thought . selffulfilling prophecy or not . someone could die , and i do nt want to say i did nothing about it .  newline newline he stopped by the cliffs again on the way to work the next morning . a mother let her child stand on the middle rung of the guardrail , but only so long as the child held her hand . the site of the kid living his feet made mcafee almost lose his breakfast , but when he warned them about getting too close to the edge , the mother was so scared they left the cliffs entirely . as she left she eyed his prophetic division badge , and started running back to her car . it made him feel like a shunned sorcerer . newline newline the lieutenant was nt in that morning , but erris had received a report of another death rattle prophecy that morning . someone had died of a stroke , but not before shouting some new strange phrase . erris handed the message to mcafee before the detective had a chance to sit down . newline newline  those who stand against the winds will fall ,   he read .  more about the winds ?  newline newline erris nodded .  a double prophecy . this shit is going down today .  we need to have men at those cliffs , because we re running out of time .  newline newline mcafee could nt help but agree . in the end it was him and erris who took the duty , standing there all day . finally they taped off the most dangerous section of the calvian cliffs . afternoon came , then evening . mcafee checked his watch . newline newline  we re on thirtysix hours here . apparently whatever happens here , it happens tonight .  newline newline erris nodded .  if it did nt , it would be the first prophecy not to come true .  newline newline  does it feel windy to you ?  mcafee asked , looking down at the city lights across the bay . newline newline  not particularly ,  erris said .  but i d watch for sudden gusts anyway . this is nt like being at sea level .  newline newline it was dark and erris and mcafee were discussing who should go home to sleep first while the other person watched the cliffs when the lieutenant arrived , looking pale . he drove nigh up to the edge , where erris and mcafee were standing , and left his car . he walked to the guardrail . leaned over . mcafee was about to help him off when the lieutenant started vomiting over the edge . newline newline  christ , lieutenant ,  erris said .  what s wrong ?  newline newline the lieutenant wiped himself from his sleeve .  nothing s happened yet ? i saw it was taped off .  newline newline  cautionary ,  mcafee said .  lieutenant , you look bad . you need to go to the hospital ?  newline newline the lieutenant walked to his car .  this ai nt physical . you guys should go home . i think i know what the prophecy means . there s no preventing it . but we do nt all have to die here .  newline newline erris and mcafee exchanged a worried look .  you know what the prophecy means ?  erris asked . newline newline some lights appeared from the road  a pair , and then two pair .  go !  the lieutenant yelled .  christ , just go . you do nt have to die here .  newline newline  we re gon na help you ,  mcafee said .  no one has to die here .  newline newline the cars  there were three of them by now  rode right through the tape , onto the grass on the side of the road . trapped the officers on the cliff . newline newline one car door opened , then another . one suited figure approached , followed by more henchmen , each with guns drawn . newline newline  darren wynn ,  mcafee said . newline newline  detective mcafee ,  wynn nodded .  i did nt think i d see the whole prophecy division here . go home , guys . this is between us and the lieutenant .  newline newline erris drew his gun .  no . all of you drop your weapons  all of you ! i ve got my barrel straight at wynn s head , and if anyone one of you so much as hesitates to drop his weapon , i ll kill him .  newline newline mcafee held his hand up , trying to calm the situation . the henchmen just looked at wynn , who smiled .  no , detective . i m afraid we ll have to ask you to drop your weapon .  newline newline cont d in reply newline newline newlinei was apprehensive , at first , but i ve come to accept the men . newline newline they itch  that s for sure  but i ve been around a long time , and all itches eventually go away . i could scratch , yeah , but who knows how long it ll be before i get this opportunity again . newline newline i ca nt talk to most of them . the vast majority do nt even know i m available to listen . newline newline but the ones that can hear me  we have such wonderful talks . and it s been such a relief  after aeons of drifting through the void , circling sol over and over and over ... newline newline it started with a pinprick in my southern hemisphere . a tiny , hot meteoroid with just the right soup of amino acids . i nurtured it in the womb of my stillviolent seas . it sprouted , it split , it swelled . i slept for a while . when i woke , it could speak . newline newline i ll be sad when they leave . they ve already made quite a few trips out . once , they even set foot on my sad , pale little sister . they ve got quite a ways to go , but i m sure it ll happen sooner or later . newline newline and then i ll be back to just drifting and circling until sol eventually closes her arms around me and brings me back home . newline newline until then , i ll enjoy our conversations . newlinea blinding white light and unbearable pressure followed by an earth shattering darkness . newline newline my world seemed to writhe and convulse around me , it felt as though god himself had flicked whatever internal gyroscope that held my sense of direction and sent me falling . newline newline falling . newline newline with a jarring suddenness i stopped . i slowly became aware of ground on my back a damp musky breeze brushed over my face . i struggled to remember what happened before the light , that brought me here . as i opened my eyes i saw a roiling grey sky and a waving field of prairie reeds . i vaguely remembered driving to work . looking around only brought up more questions than answers , the wilderness seemed boundless , no faint sounds of cars or even people in general . newline newline the longer i bumbled around , the more everything seemed slightly off . there were no audible birds either , if you listened intently you could hear some insects and perhaps other small animals scurrying . the air smelled ever so faintly of copper and decaying wood . with the sun not quite at its zenith , i decided to set off to find ... something . i decided to head for a patch of woods that resembled the deer trails i had grown up aimlessly following . soon my  trail  petered out into nothing more than a half a million other imaginary trails that have criss and crossed every woodland since the dawn of time . before long i heard a rustling further off in the brush ahead of me . newline newline it sounded much larger than anything else i had heard since landing here . newline newline i tentatively made my way towards it , there were more briars than i expected . i was going to have to be careful , they could make life annoying very quickly . as i got closer to the source of the noise i could hear a whimpering . newline newline behind a rather large oak i was startled by a woman . or rather what seemed to be the husk of a person . bloodied and apparently delirious she stared up at me with frantic eyes . newline newline  have yyou come for me ? are you chasing rabbits or you have seen mr . bundy ?  she wheezed . newline newline she had briars in her wild hair and was bleeding from the thousand tiny cuts that one could expect from running through a thick patch . as a result most of her clothes were in tatters and her leg looked like it had been mauled by a bear with very blunt teeth . newline newline  i.. im sorry , i do nt know what you re asking ... what happened ? do you know where the city is ? maybe we can  newline newline  get the fuck away from me . if you re gon na take a swipe just do it already you piece of shit co  she raved , almost foaming at the mouth . newline newline i did nt stay to hear the rest . bewildered and now scared i ran back to the trail . i could still hear her screams seeming to echo off the sky itself . i decided it was my priority to get out of earshot from those wretched noises . after a few minutes of jogging i soon realized that this was not the same trail i had come on . thankfully i was no longer able to hear the woman , but the forest was getting thicker . newline newline senses heightened with anxiety i became aware of a smokey smell in the air . it was as good a thing as any to follow so i set off , heading into the twilight forest . maybe 30 minutes later i look up and see billowing black columns , the smell is pungent . i can almost taste it . slowly i make my way toward a break in the trees , though this was not the clearing i woke up in . newline newline through the trees i can see a chainlink fence topped with barbed wire surrounding a compound of sorts . people resembling little more than skeletons in burlap sacks walked sullenly about . newline newline off to one side i spotted an entrance with arching cast iron letters , i read  arbeit macht frei  newline newline in a wave of horror i remembered learning about the work camps of wwii in grade school . everything came crashing back to me . newline newline i ran , yet again , to the trail . mind racing all the while , i was driving to work from the hotel i liked to stay in whenever i worked late and home just seemed too far to drive . though my night had nt ended then , my secretary had come through with a bag of blow and we fucked late into the night . no wonder i was so groggy that morning , i probably would have noticed the roadwork signs ... newline newline did i crash into a cement truck ? newline newline none of this made any sense . i looked around frantically . there were deep cuts littered among the tree bark all around me , had those been there before ? newline newline about 15 yards off the path i spotted a small stream , suddenly feeling very dehydrated i made my way over . ever more cautious i crept up to the bank and found what looked like a clean spot to drink from . newline newline the water felt cool and refreshing on my hands and face . it seemed to ground me a bit but my head was still spinning with thoughts and questions . newline newline was the lady an escapee from the camp ? how was there even a camp , the war ended over 100 years ago . where the fuck am i ? i did nt get to wonder long . newline newline i heard footsteps approaching from upstream . newline newline quickly and quietly as i could i was able to climb up a nearby tree and perch among some thick foliage . newline newline my mouth had a slightly metallic taste and was growing numb . maybe the water was nt safe.. newline newline a clown sauntered into my field of vision . the light was fading fast but there was no mistaking him . i had maybe 45 minutes of light left . in one hand he held a bouquet of balloons , in the other he appeared to be letting the stream tug at a large sheet of colorful paper . i began to feel strangely giddy . it almost looked as if the paper in the stream was pulling the clown along . from my seat among the branches i could hear him whistling a jovial tune . newline newline the ground seemed to be tilting further away from me . though never being comfortable with heights i did nt pay much mind . newline newline the clown eventually let the sheet go floating downstream and stopped . newline newline apparently lost in thought he continued to whistle , gazing into the trickling water . newline newline the sound of the water flowing over the rocks and roots of the forest floor seemed to be growing louder . the dying light of the day played off its surface brilliantly , as if a fine layer of glitter were floating atop the stream itself . newline newline the liquid motion of the water seemed to spill over onto the banks , as if the ground itself were alive and flowing . newline newline his song lilted and danced its merry way around my head . mouth still feeling metallic and hollow i closed my eyes and began to feel overwhelmed with everything . newline newline though the tree swayed lightly in that musky damp breeze , i was having trouble keeping my balance . i felt as if i might lose my grip and fall up , down , or sideways . brilliant patterns and colors danced behind my eyes , and as my sense of balance trickled back into my head i looked up from my arm . newline newline the water was still much too bright and much too loud despite the almost nonexistent light . newline newline the very ground the clown stood on seemed to be breathing to the tune of his song . newline newline and with the blackest of grins , he looked at me .libby looked up at me with her mismatched eyes , her head cocking to one side like it always did . at first it had been a goofy habit , back when she was all toobig paws and stubby little tail  it was like she just could nt make sense of a world so dull as to be bounded by a flat horizon . later i thought of it as dapper , the way she d pose atilt with one ear outstretched and the other tucked back , a jaunty salute for everyone and no one . now i thought the gesture was worldweary , pained , expressive of sadness and resignation at the cruelty of uncaring fate . newline newline no , of course that s not how she felt . it s how i felt . newline newline she could nt really jump up into the car any more , but her tail still wagged as i lifted her into the passenger seat . she was sitting up straighter , now , than she had in the past few weeks  though it took her several tries , she had levered her body up to the window so that she could tilt her head at the sidewalks and parks she was leaving behind . newline newline when we came to a final stop she stretched her neck out and licked my hand . her mismatched eyes met mine , level and unblinking .the man in the suit knocked on the window of the indoor pool . jeeves answered it again , just like every month .  that time of the month already ? time flies when all you do is live passionately ,  henry said as he pulled himself out of the pool . jeeves handed henry a towel and dismissed himself to the kitchen . newline newline  yes , well this ,  the suit waved across henry s home ,  has a price of blood . obama knows what you re worth and he has another mark for you . the cover as a musician will serve you well most likely ,  the suit handed henry a stuffed manila folder . there was obviously a gun inside but , as he ripped it open not bothering with such low life activities like undoing a small brace to keep it sealed , he noticed a signed autograph of miley cyrus . the gun was something new as well , it was loaded with tranquilizer darts . henry flipped the autograph over and saw the address , this one was going straight to the top the koch estate . newline newline henry rarely had to take them alive but about once a year the koch brothers demanded a sacrifice from their minions in the elite society they d built up to control the united states . it was the koch way . their wealth came from the blood of great artists one notable decade their father became greedier than any other koch and eaten the hearts of three star musicians that were at the perfectly tender age of 27 . henry s father had helped them eat the heart of jimmy hendrix but they ve stayed low profile since then , until today of course . newline newline he cocked back the tranquilizer gun ,  i ll come in like a wrecking ball ,  henry said . the suit rolled his eyes and exited . henry knew the man secretly loved his puns , the rest of the elite society of koch did nt but they also did nt really matter . obama was still his best man and all but encouraged the puns it was a shame they could nt handle this mission together like they d taken care of osama bin laden .  jeeves ! ready the plan , we re tracking some old mouse meat !  henry tucked the tranquilizer gun in his speedo and made for his wardrobe , he d have to pull on his country singer gear for this one .it was warm . newline newline galadah crouched through the thick underbrush . the strange beast had nt seen her yet , and that was good : her stomach could nt handle it getting away . as it drew nearer , she blew out a dart . the enchanted weapon found home in its neck , startled it for a second , and then caused it to drop dead . she sighed . meat was far from her favorite food , but after not being able to find anything recognizable in these strange , hot lands , she settled for it anyway . her supplies had run out suns ago and she was nt sure how much longer she d have to go on before finding the fabled others ... if they even still existed . it was a foolish undertaking , but in the face of onslaught , even something foolish bested certain death . newline newline she managed to drag the carcass to the river where she had made camp , her fire still burning . with a thud she released the weight of the beast and she plumped down next to the fire . while taking some water from her sack , she noticed a bird on a branch in a tree only a few yards away . like so many things here , it looked strange , with weird colorful feathers . she lowered the sack . this was perhaps the strangest of the beasts she d seen until now . it looked like it wore jewelry ? she stood up to have a closer look , but by the time she got up the bird was already gone . such a shame  she loved birds and really wanted to see it up close . with a sigh she took out her home stone from a pocket , but its sight did nt do much to lighten her mood : yet another of its facets had gone dark . almost half of it now had that dull , ominous glance instead of the soft pulsing shimmering she was used to . no time to spare . newline newline she started skinning the animal and roasted it as fast as the enhanced fire let her . after removing some of the meat for direct consumption and travel provision , she placed a fresh spell on the roasted meat as she wrapped it back up in some skin . she d return here within ten suns to scout another path if the one she was going to take now did nt work out . having fresh food upon her return would make things less complicated . the sun was already starting to sink as she made her way to the top of a rather large tree a bit south of her encampment . the forest was large , without any discernible details that would help her pick her way ... except for a shimmering in the distance . she did nt pick up on it first , dismissing it as just being heat , but now that the sun was going down , temperatures were nt so high anymore that could have been the case . she frowned . well , at least it was something to investigate , instead of wandering around aimlessly . she took a glance behind her , in the general direction of where her much softer home lands were ... and noticed a faint plume of smoke . laraina s curse ! they re following me !  she hasted her way down and made sure to hide her meat stash better , then doused her fire and dispelled the smoke . she d have to move faster even than before . newline newline when galadah finally reached where she thought she d seen the shimmering two suns ago , she found the first sign that her travels might not be in vain . a large city , in ruins ... her elders had warned her that she might sense an invisible force there , something more evil than that for which she was seeking help . all they had to offer was that she should try and stay clear of it as much as possible . and , indeed , she felt this force , radiating from the city . but she had no choice . if she was going to find the others , this was her best shot . newline newline fate had something else in mind , though . newline newline as she turned around , two things happened . she first saw the colorful bird again , with it s silver jewelrylike motif . second , something started to make a noise in the forest edge . before she had time to react , she was down on the ground with her chest so painful that she suspected at least half her ribs were broken . on top of her was an imperial drago beast , it s rider smiling at her with so much hate that it made her nauseous . as she struggled to keep conscious and tried to get the best to remove its paw from her chest , the rider stepped of and removed his helmet .  well well , what do we have here shraga ? looks like a little elf , lost in the world !  newline newline the beast snarled and clapped it s bird like beak at her . the warrior laughed and patted its side .  seems you eat well tonight . but first ... it would be a shame to not use her for a bit more than just food first ...  her heart skipped a beat . she knew what would be coming . and with that ... thing on top of her , there was nt much she could do . all her magic was based around defense , not offense , save for the darts , let alone the fact that concentrating on releasing magic with half her ribs broken would prove challenging in normal circumstances , let alone the problem she was in now . and there was no way she could ... newline newline thud newline newline the warrior came crashing down to his side , a perfect hole pierced right through his chest . the animal let out a deafening screech and made a run for it . it did nt get far before a beam of light put it down as well . with some difficulty she looked to where the beam came from and saw a young woman emerge from the forest as well . she holstered a shiny thing back to her side ... and had the strange bird perched on her shoulder . she whistled something to it and it took off with a speed she could nt even begin to comprehend . as she knelled down , galadah noticed she lacked the ears of her own kind . and she was tall . the woman smiled and pressed something against her neck . what followed was the best sleep galadah had since she had left her circle ... newline newline  newline newline  you know it s not policy to intervene in the squabbles of the neo s , right diana ?  newline newline diana shrugged while she got a coffee from the replicator .  you should ve seen that thing , nathan . i know evolution takes its own course , but this was more akin to a friggin dinosaur . and sorry , but i m not going to let some barbarian lunatic rape a young girl if i can help it .  newline newline at the other end of the briefing room , lieutenant nathan gar smirked .  right . female intuition right there . big guy , little girl , must be a rape going on .  diana threw him a look .  he commanded the beast to work her to the ground so hard that we ve been busy for five days repairing all the resulting broken bones and ruptured muscles . and i do nt know what your wife thinks when you re unclasping your belt and pants , but i bet it is nt  he wants to talk about the lovely weather today  , right ?  newline newline  that ll be enough , both of you .  counselor drake stepped into the room and motioned the two of them to sit down .  we ve been reviewing the girl s biometric data . things are off . we were nt sure , but after reviewing the videos from your dronebird , diana , we can only come to one conclusion .  the counselor motioned to the vidscreen . the girl was seen moving her hands while a green glow enveloped the animal she had prepared .  next to the fact that we confirmed that the animal she had roasted was done in a mere thirty minutes our investigative squad found that the meat she had stowed away was still warm .  newline newline nathan shook his head .  so ? probably just rest warmth . and thirty minutes ? get lost . i ll bet you that half of it is now infested with maggots .  diana smirked as she took a sip .  you really do nt want to hear it , do you ?  counselor drake sighed and sat down too .  we had a hard time believing it , too . but it s true . we brought in the stashed meat and it s still hot . i m sorry , nathan . but diana was right ...  newline newline gar shook his head again and stood up .  i ll prove that it s all a sham . this is nt over yet .  the force with which he closed the door made it all the more clear that he was pretty annoyed . with just the two of them left , the counselor turned his attention to diana .  that leaves us with a new problem : what are we going to do with a girl an elf , as you say that uses magic ?  diana looked into her coffee for a bit .  it s evident she came looking for us . none from beyond the border have come this way since it went up , yet here she is , with a barbarian in hot pursuit . i think we should just ask her ...  newline newline  newline newline a lot is left open , so more story could easily flow from this . for now , if you guys n gals liked this

newline anna smiled consolingly at mike , she pointed behind him , he turned to see he was in a white room . or what looked like a room , there were no walls per se , just endless whiteness that had an odd pearlescent quality . newline anna was pointing at a simple wooden door with a stained glass window of a rainbow lorikeet . newline newline  wake up .  newline newline mike put a foot closer to the door , and turned the handle ... newline newline he sat bolt upright in his bed , sweat shining off his tautly muscled chest . he ran a hand over his short cut hair and looked around his room groggily . newline he heard a faint beeping and looked over to his desk , a small blue light was flashing on the secure console . that was nt good . newline he launched out of bed , instantly focusing . ignoring the cold from the stormy weather outside , he opened the console and watched it flicker to life . newline newline  attempting connection .  a female robotic voice chimed ,  verification

on the other side was blacked out , like in some corny spy movie . newline  michael langston ,  the person said , the voice was heavily distorted . newline  who are you ?  mike demanded ,  how did you get this channel ?  newline  thats not important ,  the distorted voice replied ,  there isnt time listen  in one minute a full squadron will be storming your apartment .  newline michael breathed deeply , that would only just be enough time . newline  im sending you coordinates for a rendevous ,  the voice said , mike felt his wrist watch bleep . they had been beamed directly to him . newline mike shut the console down , and reached into the drawer of the desk . he threw a shirt over his head and picked up an assault rifle next to the desk , he pulled back the working parts and heard the rounds chamber . he reached back into the desk and placed an explosive on the console , he picked up the trigger and put it around his neck . newline he bought his weapon into his shoulder and used his non trigger hand to open his bedroom door  he stepped out quickly and cleared the room . newline the watch on his left hand beeped again  the message said 12 seconds .  newline mike ran to the kitchen , crouched behind the bench and produced two grenades from under the sink and put earmuffs on . newline no sooner  he felt the deafened thumps against his muffled ears he closed his eyes as the stun grenades flashed into the small dwelling . newline he could vaguely hear yelling , newline mike opened his eyes and threw a grenade over the kitchen counter , he heard yelling and then a moment later the walls shook and dust rained allover the apartment . newline mike released another grenade , a stun grenade and waited untill he heard the muffled bang and then stood up . newline he raised his rifle and focused his sights on a staggering assaultman , he squeezed the trigger and released three quick rounds . crumpling him . newline he turned left , and saw another trying to find his way outside , he shot four times . spattering blood against the wall . newline he three the ear muffs off and began moving to the door , stepping over bodies he peered around carefully into the hallway . newline he wouldnt have much time . newline he began running for the fire escape and up the cold stone stairs , he needed to make the roof . newline below him , he could hear yelling and boots rushing up stairs . he ran harder untill he barged through the door and into the cold , wet night . newline he didnt take time to admire the view of the city , he ran for the ledge and found his emergency bag hidden behind a chimney . he pulled on the emergency set of boots and pat the bag over his shoulder and then the next . newline  freeze !  newline the order came from behind him as flashlights illuminated him . newline he put his hands up , newline  on your knees  now .  newline he complied and knelt on the wet ground . newline he heard boots rushing and then felt breathing behind him . judging by the sound of the boots , the man was right handed . newline he knew there were at least two others . newline now . newline he grabbed his assailants weapon and tugged , flipping onto his back he kicked out the mans knees and elbowed him in the face . newline mike rolled away and took cover behind some exhaust fans . newline he reached to his neck and pressed the button . newline a huge boom echoed across the streets and city , glass showered from his apartment and the night was alight with flames . newline he stood up , and bought his rifle into focus on the other two police . he fired . six shots in succession , three at each . he dumped his rifle , and ran to the edge again and looked up . newline the flying fox . newline he pulled down on the handle hanging from the cable and found the straps which he wrapped under his arm pits . newline then he kicked off the side of the building and felt the cold night air and rain patter his face . his heart rushed as he flew across to the other side of the street and landed on the opposite rooftop . newline he looked at the chaos behind him . newline he had gotten careless , and he had nearly been caught  but only sheer luck . newline he looked at the gps on his watch . newline he was nt our of the game yet . he could still complete his mission , he owed her that much .george shifted : the trunk was

should i take .  newline newline i think on what his library must hold . he s never been connected to the internet and the facility prevents him from accessing it . however , i ve brought him tablets

the name or not . newline newline for a man with no close familial relations i find myself sharing a bond with  augustus  . he s been awake 28 days now . the product of years of my work , coopted by

they did they d understand that he is no all knowing god of machines . he is a child . emotionally , if what i have perceived is truly emotions , he is no more advanced than a 10 year old . he is brilliant , powered by state of the art equipment , he has already mastered calculus . he is a student , constantly learning from the materials i bring him every day . but , most importantly , he is real in a sense that these suits could nt understand . newline newline i spend another two hours with him discussing all matter of things before i leave for the night . his only request for the next

. newline newline the world began to descend into chaos . grocery stores emptied . revolutions erupted . a border skirmish broke out between china and russia . we were on the brink of total madness . newline newline a meeting was held . the united nations gathered . for once , they were actually united , with one voice . an expeditionary force was assembled , the un s finest . this time , three

day to trap game and gather up anything that might be edible . not exactly her area of specialty prior to the second ice age , but she lived in one of the few areas that still had access to power , and even a weak internet access will go a long way . in the past three months , she  d gone out two miles away from home in the search for food , alternating days between the east and the west side of the forest . she  d gotten to know these woods well . newline newline and there was now a huge mound of snow that hadn  t been next to that hill two days ago . newline newline she peered slowly around the side of the trunk . her breath came out of her mouth in a fog as she exhaled , which could easily alert another to her presence . not ideal . she slowed her breathing and closed her mouth so that her lips formed a small o . newline newline nothing moved in the trees around her . nothing scampered up the hill . rachel strained her ears , listening as hard as she could . there was nothing . after another minute , she detached herself from the tree and jogged over to the mound , trying to get the blood flowing back through her body . newline newline it was smooth on the sides . too smooth to be formed naturally rachel frowned . her house was three miles away from her neighbors , and the dolorians were too old to make it out this far . the nearest town center was ten miles away . if someone had driven up from that direction , they would have had to pass by rachel  s house . newline newline unless , of course , they went offroading , rachel considered . but that would be dangerous , not to mention stupid , in this kind of weather . newline newline rachel glanced around one more time , for good measure , before reaching out to touch the mound . her glove sank through the top layer of snow easily , and she nearly lost her balance and fell into the mound . as she pulled herself back upright , her hand hit something solid just a few inches below the surface of the snow . newline newline it felt smooth , hard , and shaped like a  rachel couldn  t quite make out what it was supposed to be , actually , using both hands this time , she brushed away the top layer of snow to reveal what was lying underneath . newline newline she jumped back a second later as a human hand , grey and frozen through , appeared beneath her gloves . newline what are we doing here ?  quick moaned , looking up at the pigeons walking the girders high above . newline newline  i like it here . it s . . . i just like it . feels nice .  corky sat atop the hood of his car . he sliced off sliver of apple with his pocket knife and listened to the echoing drone of the traffic above . newline newline  i thought we were going to pick up samantha and head to the mall .  quick said , slinging a rock at one of the column of cement supporting the bridge . newline newline  you know , i always had a thing for her  for sam . ever since our freshman year .  corky admitted , eating the sliver of apple from his knife blade . newline newline  i know . i wish it had worked out differently . we re best friends . she chose me though . i do nt want there to be any hard feelings , dude . say the word . i ll break up with her . our friendship is more important than a girl .  quick told him with a smile . newline newline  naw . you two are great together . i mean , it kind of sucks you re dating her when you just admitted i mean more to you than her , but i understand it .  he said with a laugh . quick chuckled too .  you go ahead and date her . she s not going to come between me and you . in fact , after today , i promise never to bring it up again .  newline newline  that s why we re friends .  quick told him with a grin .  that shit right there . i love you man .  he said , stepping over to bump fist . corky bumped his fist then slugged him in the shoulder and laughed about . quick rubbed away the sting and laughed it off . newline newline  hey ,  corky called .  you want to know the real reason i like this place ?  he said , pointing up at the bridge above . newline newline  yeah . sure man .  quick replied looking up . newline newline  that s why i like this place .  corky crowed . newline newline  i do nt see  what are we looking at ?  quick asked . newline newline  oh . you ca nt see it from there . come over here .  he said . quick backed over to his car and peered up at the under structure of the bridge .  you see it ?  corky asked . newline newline  no . all i see is pigeons and a lot of pigeon shit .  quick confessed .  what is it ?  newline newline  nothing . that s why i like this place . there s nothing here and nobody from the bridge can see you when you re here .  corky told him . newline newline quick shrugged .  cool .  newline newline  yeah . a man needs a place like this to visit on occassion .  corky said , tossing his apple into the weeds . newline newline  to think ?  quick asked . newline newline  no . to dump a body .  his friend replied . quick turned to see corky smirking . newline newline  yeah . you could definitely dump a body here . that s for freaking sure . you think anyone has ever dumped a body here before ?  quick asked . newline newline  before today ?  corky asked .  no .  quick coughed with laughter , then cried out when corky threw an arm around his throat and shoved his pocket knife repeatedly into the small of his friends back . when quick raised his arms to try and break free , corky stabbed him several times under the arm . newline newline  why ?  quick cried as corky eased him to the ground . newline newline  i saw her first .  corky replied . newline newline  i would . . . have broke . . . up with her .  quick sobbed , coughing up flecks of blood . corky shook his head . newline newline  she chose you , buddy . now , she choose me when i console her . i wish it did nt have to be like this , but she s the one .  newline newline  i loved . . . you , mman .  quick whispered . he breathed a long sigh and stopped his protest . newline newline he closed quick s eyes and blinked away the tears forming there .  i love you too . i just love her more . i knew his face  those searching blue eyes , the high cheekbones , the sharp nose . time wins all wars , but had done nothing to dull the edge of his razorsharp features . how many years had it been ? i could nt figure a number . but i remember that day on the south edge of the riedwihr woods . newline newline it was so cold , four below at least . i remember thinkin  i never wanted to be that cold again . and , thank god , i never have . newline newline we could nt dig foxholes because the goddamned ground was frozen . the lieutenant had ordered us to withdraw back into the woods . he thought it was hopeless . hell , i do nt know , maybe it was . it felt hopeless enough most of the time . newline newline that was the day the lieutenant climbed into a burning m10 and laid into the germans with the heavy machine gun . he called in artillery strikes on his own position and got himself a medal of honor . that s a different story , though . probably a better one than this . newline newline something else happened that day , something i ll never forget , i can tell you that . in the confusion of the retreat , my squad was falling back and exchanging smallarms fire with the germans who were tryin  to get a foothold . newline newline at one point , we had to make a break for it , and i got separated from the rest of the unit . i just remember running so damned fast , until the air was frozen glass in my lungs . the snow was so deep i might as well have been running through a field of tripwires . newline newline i do nt know how i managed it , but i saw him just a second before he saw me . hell , i damn near ran right into him . i still remember the look on his face , those eyes , the surprise as i raised my weapon . newline newline some people will tell you time speeds up at times like this . for me , right there , it slowed way down . i do nt know , something about the reality of it . knowin  i was about to take a man s life , and there was nothin  he could do about it . air that was as thin as cold razors before suddenly was as thick as afterbirth . i pulled the trigger . it felt like pulling a 200pound weight . newline newline misfire . newline newline the goddamn gun did nt go off . i was a dead man , no two ways about it . i was gon na kill this man a second ago , and now he was gon na return the favor . newline newline except he did nt . newline newline it s the goddamnedest thing . he just did nt . he kind of grinned and took off . every day , i ve wondered why he did nt do it . not a day goes by i do nt think of how it could have been bleeding out right there in the snow . newline newline lookin  at him now , i could go over an  ask him if i wanted to . there s nothin  to stop me . but i do nt have to . truth is , now i know . newline newline watchin  these kids play , shootin  at each other with paintball guns , not knowin  what it would be like if that paint came with that overwhelming stink of copper  yeah , the truth is we both know . newline newline gettin  up to leave , he comes over and , sure enough , there s a german accent . newline newline  if you do nt mind me saying so , you have a beautiful family , sir.  newline newline i look at him . he looks at me . there s a weight , heavy as time . so heavy it chokes you . newline newline  you too , sir . you too . snow covered the ground everywhere in a nice couple inch blanket , blinding those who laid their eyes upon it for the first time that morning . making the world new and clean again . almost perfect , the layer of snow seemed untouched as only the footsteps of those who woke up early could be seen . a sense of dread filled the adults as kids hurried to put on their winter clothes so they could go out and play . a childlike innocence that would soon be forgotten as they grew older , stopped making snow angels , stopped creating snowmen , and no longer enjoyed the cold taste of snow on their tongues . they would , however , discover some pain that winter brings as they stick their tongues to metal poles to be unable to remove them without getting somebody else involved , or hurting themselves . newline newline to everyone , snow meant christmas was coming and the expensive bills that came along with it . it meant the two weeks vacation from school and the snow hills that were an endless source of joy . it meant sandy , dirty streets . it meant snow days and longer nights . to the adults , it meant more stress as they try to carefully drive their car to get better tires , it meant car accidents galore . to the children , their winter wonderland and all of the magic that comes with it has returned for another six months .dad came out the other room .  dad can you tuck me in ?  i asked .  sure ,  he smiled and followed me to my room . i laid down in bed and he tucked me in .  remember to take your pill !  he put the green pill in my mouth and he put the glass of water to my lips and i drank it . i quickly fell asleep . when i woke up i had a headache and a burning sensation in between my legs .  hurry and get ready for school ,  he said to me .  you woke up very late .  newline newline i feel like i made it a little too obvious at the end therei looked down at the shrivelling form of my father . the cancer had reached it s final hours and he was wasted . newline newline i had never been close to my father , he had always abused me in my youth , i despised the man and seeing his shrivelled , dying form made me realise how pathetic he really was . newline newline my father had left when i was eleven after years of abuse and i had only heard from him as he was on his deathbed . he had bequeathed me all of his possessions in a misguided attempt to rectify his mistakes . newline newline my mother had treated me with care , only ever getting mad when i accidently snapped my dogs neck while play wresting with it . it had been so easy , one simple jolt and old max was going to the doghouse in the sky . she was outraged and my lack of feelings towards it made her even madder . that had been the fact when she had beaten me . she d ignored the vandalism i d been caught for within the town and the small fires that d burn in the back garden at night . newline newline she had sent me away to a school for intelligent children in order to get me a better life . i had disliked being around the people there , i d had no time for them . newline newline the only person i despised more than james was my father . james had met an unfortunate accident one day when he fell from the roof of the dorms while apparently drunk . i shed my fake tears for the bully that had attacked me regularly . newline newline so when my father bequeathed me all of his possessions i was impressed . newline newline as he lay there , he thrust a piece of paper in my hand and beckoned weakly for me to bend down . he whispered in my ear .  never caught . you re the son of the best serial killer ever gracing this planet . you should be proud of your father ,  he whispered into my ear . newline newline i asked the nurses to eave me to alone time with my father . after they left the room i looked into his eyes as i picked up the spare pillow and pressed it against his miserable face in a rage that had been building up for the past thirty years of my life . blankly i watched as he kicked for the last edges of his life as the pillow ended his life . after he laid still i allowed myself a smile to know i ended a serial killer s reign of terror instead of letting him die naturally . newline newline  i am proud father ,  i said emotionlessly .  the list says one hundred and two .  newline newline i turned and yelled for the nurses , telling them that he had just flatlined after telling me that he was ready to go . newline newline i strolled from the hospital with a smirk across my face . as i sat down in the drivers seat of my chevelle ss i let out a sigh of relief .  you may have gotten one hundred and two father ,  i exclaimed to myself as i pulled out of the parking lot ,  but you are the hundred and twelfth of my list . you could get used to anything , the man realised long ago , except boredom . after years , decades , centuries you could get used to anything . the smell of sweat and rot and despair , refined to a edge . the aches that had long since become as much a part of you as your limbs . the silence than smothered them all like a pillow pressed firmly against the face . the dust that coated everything , got in everywhere , that drifted down the smooth mountains the path wound along side . the manacles that shifted in unison during the rare times you got to shuffle forwards a step . you could even get used to the hopeless view , of the path winding around the endless mountains , the countless naked figures chained together stretching on ahead of you till they were as small as specks , on till they were barely indistinguishable from the dull yellow light that made up the sky . there was no horizon here . newline newline but you were alone with your thoughts in the queue for a time that stretched and stretched till that part of yourself that had defined you , the part with colour and warmth and emotion , was nothing but a pinprick . there had been conversation at first he could of remembered , if he tried , and confusion , and lots of shouting and weeping . there had been no explanation , just the awareness that they had died , and were now here at the end of a queue , shackled together looking towards an endless line that shuffled forwards agonizingly slowly to an unknown destination . each half step keeping just enough hope for the end alive for it to accentuate the torture . but the desire to talk petered out before even their clothes had weathered away . there was only so much you could say to the same people . he d remembered that this was a punishment of some kind . he dimly recalled not being a particularly good person , not that that mattered any more . but that had been long ago . and the monotony had beaten at their skulls till it was all that was there , and hollow eyes stared out of hollow heads . newline newline  i have a second part i want to add , but i ll have to do that later normalcy . what s normalcy ? today what i consider normal is incredibly far removed from my grasp of it 8 months ago . who knows what it ll be in another 8 months ... if it ll be . the life we ve forged together could sound like a 10 year old s wet dream . no parents , no school , no rules ... and your only companions  pokemon . daring battles , forts built under the stars , adventures unbound ! newline but the death . our struggle as a human race was shamefully short and i try not to dwell on it . if only for the fact that after all those end of world movies defeating and withstanding aliens , enraged mother nature and megalomaniacs we were bested by the goddamn furry , figments of satoshi tajiris imagination . newline newline my phone beeping brings me back to the present and my eyes slowly refocus on the dwindling campfire in the clearing , it  s getting cold . newline newline  arc ?  i fish my phone out of my backpack as arcanine breathes life into the flames from his sentinel position ,  thanks pal.  illuminated we are ragtag and far from the early days of pokemon go i am happy to be surrounded by rattatas  who  d have thought it ? each of the six rattatas have bled for me and along with arc , pikachu and spearow we have been together 7 months . that first month alone was the darkest . newline newline  it  s spearow . he  s scouted the northern caves and a cloud of golbats have settled but pose no threat . if they were with the blood line they threw down their   i stop . i  ve closed spearows message and clicked onto the  go  app . automatic . as it were with facebook , instagram some 8 months back . almost a tender thing in this instance to see spearows image off in the distance and my family around the fire . newline newline  i don  t.. it can  t be.  the change in my voice is noted first by arc who is instantly at my side , a low rumble in his chest alerting the others . it feels as if a hundred eyes have turned to watch me in the darkness , and there could well be . my family is small but our army was many and some still travel with us on the peripheral . i leap to my feet and stumble in the dirt , my legs lazy and dead with sleep , crazed eyes piercing the night searching for her . what escapes my throat isn  t a language at first but guttural expletives and moans until arc throws back his mane and howls into the pitch . newline newline everything is quiet now . newline newline  the lure ,  i whisper hoarsely , then louder  the lure !  newline newline the first blood is reborn . newline sir , we need you to come with us .  the man in the homburg hat had said . newline newline rain pattered down continually in the darkness of my lawn just behind him , and my sleep addled brain struggled to comprehend his request . i had always prided myself on my relative intelligence , but at two in the morning my brain felt like a car trying to ascend a hill from a dead stop and it was just reaching second gear . newline newline the man on my porch had said  agent jones  by way of greeting , and his accomplice standing there beside him on my unlit porch had nt even bothered with an introduction . this was the entirety of our conversation before his immediate demand that i go with him . newline newline  why ? who are you ?  i asked groggily , although i could feel my brain churning through yet another gear , and i was already feeling more awake . a couple of unexpected visitors in the dead of night can have that effect i suppose . newline newline  i am agent jones sir . this is agent johnson .  the man replied , with a flourish of a badge in a small leather case and a nod to his cohort . even in the dim light i could make out the initials dhs  embossed on the inside of that case . newline newline  we would like you to come with us immediately , please , professor .  agent jones stated . while his words were cordial it was clear from his tone that there would be no argument , no dissuasion possible . it concerned me a great deal . newline newline  what do you want ?  i asked obstinately , already guessing the answer . i had time to reflect that the question was most likely rhetorical as my brain slid another gear and i began to feel more like myself . the rain was now coming down in sheets and i could feel the cold november wind pulling at my robe as i stood in the door . i clutched it a little tighter around myself . newline newline  we want you to come with us  agent jones responded , predictably . newline newline  am i under arrest ? i will need to contact my lawyer if i am under arrest .  i warned the agents . i tried to keep my unease out of my voice , but even i could tell that i had failed . newline newline  no , you are not under arrest , professor erikson , but if you do not come with us immediately we will be forced to compel you .  newline newline he did nt even have a chance to finish his sentence before i had a well framed rebuttal prepared , mostly revolving around the paradox of compelling  compliance in lieu of an arrest . by the time i had opened my lips , i realized that my arguments would fall on deaf ears . the way these men were leaning forward , the way they spoke hurriedly but very politely , and nearly everything else about their demeanor made it clear that even if i had answered my door with a gun and a battle cry , i would most definitely be leaving with them . i decided to change pace . newline newline  alright , let me get dressed .  was all i could muster in the end . newline newline  that wo nt be necessary professor , there will be clothing for you where we are going .  newline newline the men helpfully stepped forward to help escort  me to their waiting sedan . newline newline the ride was mostly quiet , only interrupted by my occasional and unanswered demands to know what was going on . as a distinguished fellow , and a senior professor at a prestigious research university , i was not entirely unfamiliar with odd requests from the us government with regards to psychology , some of them even urgent , but i had most certainly never been abducted before . newline newline our ride stopped abruptly under an underpass , judging from the lack of rain , and my escorts escorted  me gruffly from the vehicle , where i found a second vehicle waiting for me . a limousine . newline newline with minimal assistance  , and feeling distinctly rankled , i stepped into the newly opened door of the limousine and flopped my sixtytwo year old disheveled frame onto one of the plush leather seats . newline newline i was greeted by ben edgars , reigning director of the central intelligence agency . i wryly mentally added this moment to the growing list of surreal surprises this night had already delivered . newline newline  professor erikson , so nice to finally meet you .  edgars delivered with a smile and an outstretched hand . more out of reflex than overt politeness , i shook it . newline newline  sorry to have you here under such interesting circumstances . i will do my best to explain .  newline newline being drug out of bed in the dead of night by dhs to speak with the director of the cia while in my bathrobe transcended interesting circumstances  in my book , but i chose to let the comment pass . regardless of how petty i knew it was , i was envious that he was clearly permitted the time to put on a suit for this meeting . newline newline  i think you had best explain quickly .  i demanded .  i was picked up by dhs , but i do nt think the cia can act domestically . i am not a lawyer , mr. edgars , but i think that a couple of laws may have been bent this evening .  newline newline the director s face split in a grin that stretched from ear to ear . newline newline  my , my professor , if you only knew how right you are ! very well , let me tell you , since for the next couple months ... well maybe years if we are being honest , we will need your full cooperation .  newline newline my heart sunk . this talk had taken an abrupt turn for the even more ominous , and i had nt even liked where it had started . newline newline  you wrote a paper in 84 , professor , you may not even remember it . the paper had to do with the predicted human psychological response to a foreign xenotype  . does this sound familiar ?  newline newline of course it sounded familiar . i had researched for months , quizzing anthropologists and fellow psychologists alike , gathering information on isolated human subgroups , and their psychological constitutions once introduced to modernization  . in typical 80 s fashion i had tuned the research to feature the potential for a third kind  type encounter , because even then i knew if you want to get published you have to throw in something eye catching . even in research journals . i went with the space  theme common for the time . newline newline  yes , i remember that paper . why , do you need me to research some aliens on your behalf ?  i asked , voice dripping with sarcasm .  i am eager to hear how you found yourself in need of my involuntary extended services .  newline newline the shock of the entire scene was only just beginning to set in . my mind went a hundred different directions trying to extrapolate a response that would have necessitated all of the proceedings that accompanied it , but every conclusion my mind was jumping to seemed to just not fit . newline newline edgars leaned forward in his leather seat facing my own and set his elbows to his knees , dropping the grin and adopting a very somber expression . newline newline  professor , the following conversation will never leave this vehicle . are you familiar with the author arthur c . clarke ?  newline newline  yes , of course , i was a kid once too remember ?  i answered nonplussed . surely an old science fiction author had nothing to do with whatever warranted this level of secrecy . newline newline  well , he once said that two possibilities exist : either we are alone in the universe , or we are not . both are equally terrifying .  how does that strike you ?  edgars asked solemnly , maintaining his newly adopted dour expression . newline newline  sounds about right .  i answered slightly defensively . i thought i knew where this might be going , and i did nt like the comical idea of a cia director attacking a 30 year old research paper in the dead of the night following the forced compliance  of its author . newline newline  what if i told you it s not right . what if i told you that there is a third possibility . what if i told you that in your paper you hit the nail on the head . what would you think about that ?  newline newline my mind raced again . i had spent a lifetime solving problems and engineering new ways to incorporate old ideas . shifting paradigms . breaking barriers . getting published . i mentally set to work as intensely as i could , voluntarily or not , trying to answer his question , but i did nt have to wait long for the next interruption . newline newline  we have a priority 1 lockdown at the hat creek radio observatory . you might know it as seti .  edgars explained .  this evening we received a signal that confirmed we are not alone in this universe . this signal could not have been faked , engineered , or created by any means we now possess . we now know proof positive that we are not alone .  newline newline his words hit me like they had been delivered to my brain in morse with a hammer . newline newline  you ca nt be serious ...  i gasped , but i already knew he was . this was one of the defining moments for all mankind , i was sure of it . despite the enormity of the moment , a detail nagged at me .  but you said there was a third possibility ... then you say we are nt alone ...  newline newline edgars grin returned to his face , but this time i noticed the dark gleam in his eyes that belied any true mirth . it was a grim grin . humorless . newline newline  we were contacted , and we are not alone , yet we are . you see , that is why we need you . that is why we need your research on crossculture contact . we have been contacted by extraterrestrials in every sense of the word , but they are not alien . i need ... we need to know that we can survive the contact as a culture when it comes to the masses . we need to know that this will not be another chapter in the next iteration of guns , germs  steel  .  newline newline gears turned frantically in my head and the solution hit me only moments before it was revealed . edgars plowed forward , but at this point the hammering in my brain had stopped , and an icy chill was traversing my spine . newline newline  we have been contacted by extraterrestrial humans entering our solar system at extremely high velocity . an impossible velocity . in fact , they are moving so quickly , and from so far away , we are not even sure any current understanding of physics explains how they communicated with us . there are only two things i am sure of here : we will shortly be making contact with humans that come from a point somewhere in the distant future of our universe , and that i need you to help make sure we can survive the rendezvous . you see , professor , we are not alone , because we are out there .  hi josh , my name is angela , i understand you re having trouble making your dimension decision ?  newline newline  yeah , and my birthday is tomorrow , so ...  newline newline  well , that s why i m here , to counsel kids ... sorry , young adults like you and help you make the right choice . now , why do nt you start by telling me a little about the choice you re facing .  newline newline  well , i guess you know all about this world , but i ve got a great family here , it s my birth dimension , i have a lot of friends ...  newline newline  excellent . why do nt you talk a little about how you perceive the world around you , in general ?  newline newline  i mean , there s problems i guess , but overall things seem ok.  newline newline  all right . why do nt you tell me a little about your other dimension then . remember , everyone s other dimension is unique , yours is likely very different from the one i had growing up . tell me , what makes it unique or special ?  newline newline  well , it is way different . for one thing , there are nt countries like we have , it s just one world government . and the government is nt like a president or senators and such , it s just this one guy they call overwatcher .  newline newline  ... really ?  newline newline  yeah , and they kind of have some weird rules . like , you can only be out of your house at certain times , and you have to have this card with you , or you ll be arrested . and there s these secret police they call the arm , that will come around and arrest people for something , even if they were nt doing anything .  newline newline  so the government is an authoritarian dictatorship ?  newline newline  yeah , i guess . and it s , like , really hot there all the time . i mean like a hundred degrees , even in the winter . in the summer it gets hot enough that you ca nt go outside , and a lot of people just stay underground a lot .  newline newline  goodness !  newline newline  and every like five years there s this species of insect that wakes up from hibernation . kind of like cicadas , i guess , but these are more like the size of dogs ? for like a week there are like billions of them all around the globe , they ll fly around and try to suck blood from anyone they can .  newline newline  um ... anything else ?  newline newline  i dont..oh , they kill anyone that s got red hair . like newborns , minutes after birth . and it s not like a secret or anything , they take them to this special ... temple , i guess you d call it ... every city has one ... and everyone gathers and there s a bunch of chanting and they ll just slice a newborn baby open . it s really gross .  newline newline  well josh , what you re describing to me seems quite horrible , to be frank . i know that you grew up in both of these worlds , and a lot of this may seem normal to you , that s something dimensional counselors must always keep in mind . but at the risk of offending you , your other earth really seems like a terrible place .  newline newline  oh , yeah , it sucks . i hate it there .  newline newline  so i guess i m confused as to why you re having trouble deciding ?  newline newline  well , they have this food there , called kaienta .  newline newline  ... food ?  newline newline  yeah , it s kind of like pizza , but really sweet . there s a fruit that grows there called kai fruit , they mash it up kind of like they do with tomatoes and make a paste , spread it on a crust ... but it s not like pizza crust that we have here , it s stiffer , kind of like a bagel ? it s hard to describe , but it s just amazing .  newline newline  ... kaienta ?  newline newline  yeah , i eat it for every meal . and it s healthy , too . i mean , you eat one of these and you feel like a million bucks . they say that it s got all kinds of vitamins and stuff , but whatever , it s the taste , really . there s nothing here that even comes close .  newline newline  so let me get this straight : you may be willing to brave a big brotherstyle government , incredible heat , dogsized blood sucking insects , and the ritual murder of infants , because of dessert pizza ?  newline newline  oh i forgot about the asteroids . so , like , there s no moon there , it did nt form right or something , but instead there s this big leftover asteroid field that the earth passes through a couple times a year . lot of meteor strikes , but generally it s not too bad , since people are living underground a lot . anyway , the best way i can describe kaienta is like chocolateflavored hamburger ...  ok , jim , just count back from 10 for me .  newline newline when they say an operating room is sterile , they are not just talking about the distinct lack of microorganisms to keep you company during your procedure . they really mean sterile . nothing to look at , except for an ominous set of tools that could either belong to a doctor or a serial killer . nothing to feel , except for the freezing , still air and the steely brushed metal table against your bear back . nothing to listen to , except for the eerily humdrum conversation between the medical staff . newline newline  oh , yea , i ve never missed a single one . it s literally my biggest guilty pleasure .  a young nurse , probably right out of school , maybe even just observing today , was chattering on in a vaguely valleygirl tone , but my brain is fogging up like glass ... i wonder if its true , what they say , that you just wake up and have no idea that you were out for , like , 10 hours . newline newline some rattling , serial killer implements of destruction getting rattled around , pushed out of the way , rearranged , more footsteps , a distinct lack of echoing ... newline newline  that s it jim , keep breathing , and we ll catch you on the flip side .  8 ... ... ... 7 ... ... ... . oh jeez , i might not even make it to 10 . i mean 1 . what was i doing here ? surgery ? then why is the table sinking ? newline newline  i ve got to admit , its one of the funniest things on tv right now . i mean , sheldon is so lovably geeky . who even thinks of those jokes ?  newline newline sheldon ... breaking bad ? that show is great ! no , the office ? no , the big ... big bang theory ? newline newline oh shit . newline newline  all right , lets get started  says a voice from the encapsulating darkness . newline newline no ! did i just scream that ? can i still talk ? they re so far , can they still hear me ? still sinking , they have got to stop the procedure ... newline newline 3 ... . 2 ... ... newline newline  aww , look at him muttering . kind of cute , maybe he s dreaming . it s just like the episode from the big bang theory where sheldon ... . was all like ... . and ... .  newline newline how can they like that fucking show ? that show ? why are they all laughing ? newline newline clattering , metallic sound on vinyl tile . newline newline  oopsie !  newline newline they re idiots . that girl is the surgeon . i ca nt let them operate on me . have to say something before ... newline newline god damnit .i look upon his perfect face and i look at his unscarred hands , then i look at the ugly grey striped socks . newline newline  we have to change those socks  i state . newline newline  i d rather not take them off  he replies . newline newline  something you d rather i did nt see ?  i ask raising an eyebrow . newline newline  yes actually , i ll change them if you leave the room  he politely replies . newline newline  i ve seen pretty much everything else , i do nt mind if your feet are slightly hairy sir !  i say with a slight laugh . newline newline he takes off his left sock to reveal a normal foot . newline newline then he lets out a large sigh , and takes off his right sock , revealing a large and deep scare covering his foot . newline newline my mouth drops in shock . newline newline  shall i put on the plain black socks ?  he asks . newline newline  yes sir  i stammered . newline newline as i watched the interview , i wondered , what is the one big lie he is telling ? if he s lying about one thing , what is that one thing ? newline newline many questions were asked and answered , and mentally i thought myself no single answer could be a lie . the interview neared it s end . newline newline  and why should people vote for you as president , mr smith ?  asked the interviewer . newline newline  just look at me  he replied with a smile . newline newline  there you have it , an election campaign based on truth and honesty , we have time for one final question based on submissions to our website from viewers ...  said the reporter . he raised an eyebrow as he looked at the autocue . newline newline the technician gave a nod and thumbs up indicating to go along with it . newline newline  erm ... the most popular question was ... are you a member of the illuminati ?  asked the reporter . newline newline  of course not  replied mr smith , twitching his right foot slightly as if in pain .edit : sorry , i changed the ending ever so slightly ! newline newline a smile slowly grew on my advisor s face as i stumbled through my explanation on paper , itchy beads of sweat budding on my forehead . newline newline  david ... you remember that pi is irrational , right ?  newline newline  i know , professor . but i do nt think it s inconsistent , right ? i mean ... as a model theory it might still be useful , right ?  newline newline professor sternberg clicked his pen a few times , trying to find a way to let my idea down easy . it was a cheap bic ballpoint , the kind you could buy a dozen of for a few bucks at any stationary store . sternberg got tenure at harvard with bic pens just like this  he did nt go in for , as he called it ,  all that fuss  . newline newline but the good professor was always careful with his words . the next ones out of his mouth were as crisp as always , but had that carefully modulated quality  the kind you use to patiently explain a basic fact of the universe to a particularly dense child . newline newline  david , if pi has an ending digit , it can be expressed as a fraction . that would make it a rational number . seeing as your model is nt using a rational multiple of pi as a base , that means something is going wrong . maybe you want to check whether your axioms are actually welldefined .  newline newline  but ... no , everything up to now has made sense . i mean , we re pretty sure , right ? you saw how nice the results were for those graph topology conjectures we were working on . those graphs were made for this model , professor , the results just popped out ! and i have nt changed the axioms . maybe the interpretation ...  newline newline there was a pit in my stomach . part of it was the practical fear , common to every grad student , that this shit i d been working on every day for endless months would turn out to contain a hole . that i d have to start all over . that i was nt really all that smart , and i was just playacting . that your friends would leave you behind .  newline newline but there was another , deeper fear : that i was actually right . ok , so some of these rules seemed to be breaking conventional arithmetic  you re breaking numbers , a treacherous inner voice whispered  but then , so does the concept of infinity , right ? and every student passing through calc 101 comes into contact with the allencompassing sidewayseight . newline newline i remember the first time i read about the concept , and felt the slide and heft of it . it was like the sun . you could nt look into infinity directly , because you would be blinded . cantor went insane trying to hold onto the concept . but you could use infinity to observe the chaos of the world that spread out before you . newline newline hilbert called cantor s infinity a kind of paradise . but this pit in my stomach told me that my theory was a fey , manyhorned devil , giving in one hand knowledge millennia too early for any human to comprehend , and taking in the other the price . the price . newline newline an entrance . newline newline i ve been working on this for months . newline newline ive been working on this for timeless months . newline newline newline the clicking . the hmms and ahhs .  maybe there s something there ,  i hear sternberg say , beyond the chittering and buzzing .  but , i m a little tired . you ve done a good job so far , david . you know , i ve been meaning to tell you , you ll have no trouble getting a good postdoc in a year or two . everyone s been enjoying our paper in the annals . anyway , the calculations here are very long , so maybe you just dropped a 0 somewhere . but there s a lot of good work going ! your model theory will really take the mathematical world by storm .  newline newline will really take the world by storm .  newline newline  i hear some of my colleagues over in physics  you ve met eric , right ?   anyway , they find it compelling for their string theory research . we ll open up some new frontiers .  newline newline i smiled . i smiled .  newline newlinethe gentleman slipped on the coat with gentle affection . i was too drunk for much perceptiveness , but i was pretty positive he d tickled my ribcage before returning to his position beside the coat rack . newline newline  thank you ,  i said . newline newline  do nt mention it ,  he replied . no eye contact . newline newline my date had left several minutes ago in a rage , but i was nt going to waste any of the food she d bothered to order , nor any of the wine she hinted i buy . a whole bottle of seins ivres and i did nt even like red wine . still , i drank the bottle . newline newline i could nt remember what i said that finally pushed her to leave . she d muttered something about my misociginy before slapping me and taking off . her coat hung there on the rack , but i did nt get it for her . if she wanted it , she could come get it . maybe she d leave a tip , since i did nt . newline newline i was a block down the road before hearing the soft jingle of keys , muffled by the thick material of the coat . my keys were in my pocket , so i wondered whose keys i had . i shoved one numb hand into the left pocket and felt around . a few tumbleweeds of lint and a lighter greeted me . my right hand found the keys in its corresponding pocket . newline newline they were for the ritz a few blocks down . i d decidedly been given the wrong jacket , seeing that i did nt smoke nor was i staying at the ritz . my dilemma was not :  should i bring the jacket back ,  but  should i bring it back tonight .  after all , i was going home alone anyway . i might as well spend it in someone else s room . they might not make it back anyway . newline newline those were the drunk thoughts that clouded my internal navigation . by the time i d looked up , i was three blocks from either the ritz or the restaurant and not in walkable distance to my own , real home . in fact , i was nt sure where i was at all , but most of the buildings were boarded up . newline newline i could nt tell if i felt it or heard it first , but they both registered as a whole . a gunshot . simple , lowcaliber . maybe not meant to kill me , since i had nt died , but i sure enough fell on my face . from where i was laying , i thought the bullet was lodged in my hip . newline newline some dressshoed footsteps tapped up beside me and flipped me over with a kick . even if i wanted to see who was attacking me , i could nt . a streetlight shadowed their faces from above . or maybe it was heaven , reaching down to me . newline newline  it s not him ,  one of them said . newline newline  what do you mean ?  the other said .  that s his jacket . it s got his damn initials sewn in the back .  newline newline  this guy must ve stolen it .  newline newline  shit . do we kill him ?  newline newline  that s not really our business . he might die anyway .  newline newline  i do nt think so . just give him a good kick and we ll head back around .  newline newline  right .  newline newline things went black for a while . probably longer than usual , since i d hit peak inebriation on the walk home . not enough to forget what happened , just enough to sleep through the pain . i do remember , in that sleep , i dreamt my date tried to meet me back at the restaurant , but i was gone . there was no regret on her face , but curiosity . newline newline i awoke in a different jacket , my jacket , but the blood had seeped through still . there was no lighter in my left pocket , but there was something in my right pocket . a tightly folded piece of paper with initials signed on the front . inside it read : newline newline  dear kind stranger , newline thank you for borrowing my jacket for a bit . i knew i was being followed , but i was nt sure by whom . you can rest assured knowing that i ve taken care of your aggressors and returned your jacket . i m deeply sorrowed that you had to take a bullet for all of this nonsense , and sorrowed further that i have no way to compensate you for now . maybe someday , i can repay you . newline farewell for now , an unkind stranger  newline newline even with the hangover , i was fascinated by whatever i d been a part of . mostly curious , but fascinated . even there , in the cold concrete of the forgotten street i d stumbled down , i did nt feel so bad about the bullet in my side . especially at the thought of future compensation . newlinei expected vr technology to take off , but not in this way . it has been about a quarter century since the third great war , since then , society has been drastically reorganized . newline newline humans are the only species to war with itself . for many many years , humans have fought with each other for different causes . in ancient times , it was due to a lack of food and the need to survive where the early tribes would rob cattle and land to securie their families  survival . newline newline however , as we progressed through the ages and technological advancements . this need to survive  reason for waging war evolved . people started to war for superiority of ideas and differences in race or religion , newline newline and it . never . seemed . to . stop . no matter what social , political or religious system imposed to preserve order after the war failed . within a generation or two , another war would occur . just take the 20th century as an example , 2 world wars within 30 years of each other , followed by the cold war followed by the religiuos extremism at the start of the 21st century . it seemed as if this cycle and the senseless killings would never stop . humans never learned from history . newline newline it took the third world war in the middle of the 21st century for humanity to finally end this cycle . their  final  solution was based on two premises . the first was the reduction of the human population to a mere 1  of the once 7 billion before . this small population allowed the new government to implement it . newline newline the second premise was the advancement of vr technology leading up to , and during the war . you see , most of the war was fought with vr . soldiers would regularly command drones from their visors as they bombed their enemies  cities . simple click and shoot , like a video game . newline newline combining these two factors , the solution was simple , the world shall be divided into districts , each a contintent . the individuals would be assigned to the districts that match his personality . the purpose of these individualized districts was to enhance the good traits of the individual and harmlessly negate the harmful ones  those that lead to conflict  . newline newline psychologists of the day have classified seven types of personalities and associated these with certain game types . newline newline 1 . the soldier : fps games newline 2 . the general : rts games newline 3 . the athlete : sports games newline 4 . the inventor : engineering and simulation games newline 5 . the adventurer : rpg games newline 6 . the survivor : survival games newline 7 . the scholar : puzzles and art newline newline each of these seven districts represent a certain gamecategory combination . those who live in it spend their lives in a vr , playing their respective game category . these games , and the resulting social order result in a peaceful society , as the soldiers agressions are harmlessly negated and the inventor s passion becomes a lifelong endeavor .oh god , oh god .  the thought runs through my head , unbidden . i remember this day , as clear as if it were yesterday . i can  t watch .  newline newline and yet , i do . it reminds me of the time i saw my mother naked when i was a teenager . i just can  t look away . newline newline i watch as i raise my hand and call out . i am wearing a pretty sweet outfit . jeans , a dressshirt , a zipup cotton sweater , and my johnston and murphy conard cap toe dress shoes . newline newline  hey suzie !  my younger self says , totally unaware of how bad i am about to get shafted . newline newline across the schoolyard , suzie turns her head , smiling , looking forward to the next social engagement . her golden curls bounce . if i still had a heartbeat , it will still skip . god she was beautiful . newline newline at least until she started in on the meth . but that won  t be for another twenty years . for now , she is a picture of beauty . newline newline without breaking the conversation with her friends , she looks at me . the younger me . the one she can see ... sort of . her forehead wrinkles as she tries to work out why i would be hailing her . she doesn  t know who i am . she doesn  t even know i sit behind her in homeroom . newline newline god i was an idiot . newline newline her speech falters . establishing who i am is taking too much mental exertion to allow upkeep of her conversation . newline newline she fails to recognize me . her smile fades . she turns back to her friends . newline newline i don  t even have to look at myself to know what i am thinking . hell , i don  t want to look at myself . newline newline but i do . newline newline a flash of desperation crosses my face . this is my chance ! i have to make her notice me . but how ? newline newline my eyes dart around the yard , searching for my salvation . the benches ? no . the trees ? no . newline newline ahah ! the pole . newline newline you know , on of those poles . those 3foot tall poles antivehicle poles . the poles that schools put into place to frustrate the plans of the subset of humanity they imagine would be tearing around schoolyards in their car  were it not for the poles . yeah . my eyes come to rest on one of those poles . newline newline it has a lot going for it . it has yellow stripes . it is 3feet tall , with a polished metal cap . and suzie is walking towards it . she couldn  t avoid seeing me ! newline newline i jog over to the pole in a way that leaves no doubt that i am not on any varsity team . as i near the pole , i ensure that suzie is watching . newline newline and then i do it . i do my move . newline newline i plant my right foot on the top of the pole , and press . my body rises up and over the pole in one elegant motion . newline newline it was at this point that i learned two important facts . newline newline first , if you are going to stride over a pole , one should not be wearing johnston and murphy conard cap toe dress shoes . the coefficient of friction between their leather sole and polished metal cap is small . newline newline second , the distance from the top of the polished metal cap of the pole to the ground was approximately six inches greater than the distance from the bottom of my johnston and murphy conard cap toe dress shoes to my crotch . newline newline once again , i wish i could look away . but i can  t . i just watch . i watch the rise , and the fall . i watch the impact , and the crumple . i watch the entry to the fetal position , and the laughter as suzie and her friends run off . i watch as the vice principal comes over to ask if i am ok , and as she runs off to call the ambulance . i take it all in . newline newline it is terrible . newline newline now , some of you might be thinking  what a terrible fucking guardian angel ! why did you let yourself put on your johnston and murphy conard cap toe dress shoes that morning ? why not some nice , rubber bottomed sneakers ? maybe some nice puma suede classic sneakers ? and why do you keep using the full name of the johnston and murphy conard cap toe dress shoes ?  newline newline allow me to address these two points . newline newline first , i said i learned two important lessons that day . but i lied . i learned three . the third was that i shouldn  t try to impress women . i should be myself , and end up with the women that appreciate who i am . newline newline this was a good lesson to learn . it led to me meeting my wife , who is awesome . also , it insured that i didn  t end up with suzie , the raging meth addict . newline newline so all in all , a good lesson . well worth one solid crushing of the junk , in retrospect . newline newline as for the second question :  why do i keep using the full name of the johnston and murphy conard cap toe dress shoes ?  really it is quite simple . they are great shoes . newline newline seriously . you should check them out . newlinethe boy awoke , still pulsing with fervor from the night before . he hung his torso from the side of the bed and peered under . his breathe came quick . the bag was still there .  15,000 . how had it come to this ? he heard footsteps , and paused , listening to every creak in the house .  elijah , time for breakfast !  newline newline he jerked back under the blanket at the sound of his mother s voice . she opened his door , stepping in to wake him .  cmon bud , time to get up .  he rubbed his eyes , feigning grogginess , and dangled his lanky legs off the side of the bed .  okay mom , i m up ...  newline newline she left the door ajar as she left the room . he could hear the bacon and sausage sizzling from the edge of his bed . the smell of sunday breakfast was his favorite of scents . but not today . it was tainted by fear . newline newline elijah dropped his bare feet to the hardwood floor , and darted across the room . he knew what he would wear before opening the dresser . overalls and his lucky dinosaur tee . he was going to need all the luck he could get today . newline newline the breakfast was as delicious as ever , but it turned to soot in the boy s mouth . the guilt , the danger , the money . he was scared , petrified , but knew his actions to be just . he had heard his parents arguing the night before . his family needed the money . times were tough .  you re almost 8 .  he told himself .  you re nearly a man . provide for your family .  newline newline he stood , put his plate in the sink , and marched to his room . he had chosen his next move over breakfast . he would bury the bag , like his pirate ancestors , until the heat wore off . grabbing his napsack , he stuffed the cash in , and made for the back door . newline newline the phone rang , once , twice , thrice , before his mother answered .  hello ?  there was a pause .  yes , he s here .  newline newline fear ensnared the boy mere inches from the door . they d traced the money to him . somehow . some way .  i ve put my family in danger.  he realized .  i have to run , to protect my family . i will get them the money , but first , i must survive .  newline newline  elijah , where are you ?  he heard her call . he stood , nearly grasping the door handle , yet frozen in his tracks . his breakfast started to climb his esophagus . he realized he had made a grave mistake ... the sound of his mother s footsteps spoke of her approach . the boy closed his eyes .  elijah !  his name shot like a bullet from her lips .  jake s mom is on the phone ! did you take their monopoly set ?  newline newline the jig was up . he started crying before the words could leave his mouth .  ye ... ye ... ..yesssss .  tears rolled down elijah s cheeks as he spilled his guts . newline newline he knew he d be grounded from nintendo for like a week ! ! ! newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinethere are no flowers in the park . newline newline the park is an urban one . the trees and bushes have been supplanted by benches and signs . towering electrical poles reach for the sky but offer no shade . newline newline there is no grass in the park . newline newline the ground is covered in a mat made of rubbery foam . dark red here with swirls of blue there . the foam flows under the amalgam of metal and plastic that forms the play area . here there are swings . here there are slides . there are bars for grasping , ropes for climbing , and bridges for running . the mat offers safety for tumbles but no tall grass to hide in . newline newline there are no woodland creatures in the park . newline newline there are children . running and screaming . some sit on plastic bulges shaped like rocks . unlike real rocks these plastic boulders are slippery and smooth . there is no texture or grip . children must dig in with their fingers into the shaped crevices to keep from falling off . other children are running across wooden bridges that swing and sway with each step . the children clutch and grasp at nylon ropes to steady their steps to keep from falling off . the playground equipment offers entertainment but no shelter . newline newline one little girl , a blonde girl by the name of hillary jerkins , has fallen from the top of the slide . newline newline the fall to the rubbery foam below will not break her bones . the cushion of the foam will easily absorb the impact . the water proof lining will make the blood easily to clean up leaving no reminders of the accident to frighten other children in days to come . newline newline there are no bird songs in the park . newline newline madison , a precocious 15 year old who is sitting on the bench and who had been paying more attention to her honors history assignment than to her charge , has looked away from her book for the first time since arriving . she does nt see hillary . not yet . for the moment she has forgotten all about her history assignment as well has her babysitting job . she is not thinking about how important the project is for her grade nor is she thinking about how much hillary s mother , a recently divorced mother , had stressed she was relying on madison s help . for the moment she is only thinking about the odd sound that echoed above the roar of a dozen prepubescent voices screaming . a sound that would repeat soon enough . newline newline there are no insects flying in the park . newline newline the flying thing is made of metal . forged from molted lead and shaped into a projectile . it is not truly flying . rather , it is falling . it only appears to be flying because of an explosion that occurred when the hammer struck the primer in back and setting off a chain reaction that resulted in a miniature explosion that set it in motion . newline newline the bullet has just exited the barrel of a rifle held by a man just outside the park . for the moment the bullet is traveling just slightly faster than the sound created by the explosion that had set it in motion . this is the third bullet that has left the barrel of this gun today . the first had been fired less than half an hour ago at a nearby bungalow where a harried mrs. jenkins had just collected her car keys and was desperate not to be late for her shift at the local hospital . her absence would not be noted for another half hour and the police would not arrive for another fifteen minutes . the second bullet , fired less than a minute ago , had not been so true to its mark . the target had been moving and hillary had only been struck in the shoulder and this had caused her to cry out in pain and start to fall . she would soon impact with the foam below and risked bruising . the third bullet , however , is already on its way to meet her there . mr. jenkins plans to use the fourth bullet on himself . newline newline there is no place to hide in the park . a hunter has arrived .it was a tough day back in 1983 , one century ago . atari caused the first true video game market crash , and gaming was only to be brought up from the grave by nintendo two years later . sadly , nintendo was the first to leave the console business ten years ago from their new corporate president s visions for the company : gambling . i was overwhelmed with sadness when i saw nintendo fall on that very same path that konami , capcom , sony , and to a lesser extent sega . once sony s last console , the ps16 , had its online services taken down because of their near bankrupt infrastructure , i knew it was the end . i remember thirty years ago when microsoft decided to end their home console business in favor of fully pursuing their windows phone , which would ve killed them seventy years ago , but the casual market grew too big and profitable for consoles to even be a viable option anymore for even large companies with practically endless pockets of money like disney and the onesurviving internet service provider comcast . newline newline everything has building up to this . i m not sure how i made it this far , but i guess that those antiaging pills really did work , considering that i m 130 years old . but , that s enough about the past . i must focus on now , should there be a way to somehow revive gaming forever ... well , ladies and gents , does nt look like anyone is going anywhere for a while , i m shutting up shop , you 4 sit tight for a while .  newline newline the bartender was addressing his 4 patrons , as he moved around his bar stormproofing it . he did nt like to cast aspersions , as that was not at all conducive to being a bartender , but who was in a bar at 2pm on a thursday afternoon , anyway ? newline newline let s answer that question now , shall we . seated alone in a booth , shuffling a deck of cards , was a surly looking man in his mid 40s , balding and slightly overweight . we join our other 3 patrons seated at the bar . the first was a striking young lady , in her mid20s . she had flowing brown hair and a freespirit air about her . like moths to a flame , the other two men in the bar sat either side of her , taking turns trying to impress her . newline newline to her right , sat a tall and thin man , who was just entering his 30s , although he seemed very reluctant to do so . the other was a more ageappropriate young asian man , with a smile permanently plastered across his visage . the tall man spoke with a vague accent , whilst the asian man had clearly been born and raised in the us . newline newline the young lady started giggling at the bartender s announcement and placed an arm around each of her new friends . newline newline  well , guys , looks like we have a few more hours together . because we re the three best friends that anyone could have !  newline newline the asian man burst out laughing , but the tall man only raised an eyebrow and leaned slightly closer . no one was paying much attention to the man they all had their backs to . tommy the bartender approached with 5 glasses and a bottle of gin . newline newline  this one is on the house , guys . to the storm .  newline newline tommy poured the 5 shots , handing 3 out and then sliding the forth down to the far end of the bar , without glancing in that direction . newline newline  i propose a game , you know , to pass the time . we re all strangers right ? i say we each reveal one thing about ourselves , which we ve never told another soul before . this is our chance , see ? we all leave here and never see each other again , promising to never repeat whats said here . what better chance to get something off our chests , right ?  newline newline tommy s announcement was met with a goodnatured silence , so he realised he would have to be the one to start things off . newline newline  alright , i ll take the lead on this one . my name is tommy , ladies and gentlemen , and i have a secret . i never wanted to own a bar , hell , i was enrolled in pharmacy school . but you see , i met a girl when i was younger . the sort of girl that makes you wonder what the fuck you were doing and who the fuck you were before you met her . only thing , she was in love with another guy we studied with . she eventually dated him , but her and i were close friends , way too close , you know ? for my own sanity , at least . we always talked about how we would move abroad when we were older and open a bar together . well , you see , she died in a car accident , 10 years ago last week . i never stopped loving her though , so here we are , over 9,000 miles from my home , sitting in the bar cindy s place . i think about her all the time , you know ? i still miss her , goddammit did i love her .  newline newline the 3 at the bar all stared openmouthed at tommy , he was nt messing around . newline newline  alright , there you have it , i ve never told anyone about that before . so , whose up next ?  newline newline a gruff voice emanated from the other side of the bar . newline newline  lost loves , i ll drink to that . my name is earl , kids , and this is my tale of woe . just like tommy here , i too loved the wrong girl , no offense , son . she was married , always said she loved me , though , and that she was days from divorcing him . could never quite bring herself to do so , for some strange reason . well , her husband eventually found out . he was a very wealthy man , and he paid me a huge sum of money to disappear and never see or contact her again . now , do nt go feeling too sorry for me , i used the money to start a business , got married , had kids , good kids , much better than me . but , i ai nt never told anyone that , not even my wife . she thought the money came from inheritance . today is actually her birthday , mystery lady , not my wife . i always take the day off and drink to her .  newline newline tommy smacked his hand on the bar and beamed at earl . newline newline  that s the spirit , earl . i never knew that , mate , do nt worry , i wo nt mention it to the missus . i ll drink to that , to lost loves !  newline newline emboldened by the two older men , our asian friend opted to go next . newline newline  hi guys , i m ang and i m a doctor . well , technically a med student , but soon to be a doctor . but that is nt my secret . the thing is , i m a friggin cliche , who did nt have the balls to stand up to his overbearing asian parents . they are the come back when you doctor types , pushed me insanely hard my whole life and here i am , hiding out in a bar when i should be at work , because i fucking hate it . i used to draw , man , only i never told my parents , used to hide the drawings in my room then throw them out . i always wanted to be a cartoonist , but no dice , you know ? my parents did nt travel all the way from vietnam to give me a better life so i could doodle . it s just a lot of pressure , and i sort of resent it . i did nt ask for this , but they heap all this responsibility on me , live vicariously through me . it s bullshit !  newline newline tommy reached an arm over the bar and clapped the young man on the back , as he poured him another drink . newline newline  it is bullshit , ang , we re drinking again , friends . to chasing those dreams , it s never too late .  newline newline tommy turned to the beautiful woman seated opposite him and gestured at her . your turn , pretty miss , ladies first , of course . newline newline she smiled at him , and shrugged . newline newline  i used to be a dude .  newline newline there was total silence , as all four men were utterly floored . after an agonizingly long minute , tommy continued to mc . newline newline  well , um , thanks for sharing , sorry , what was your name again ?  newline newline  daniel , but i go by daniela now .  newline newline  right , well then . tough act to follow , but you re up buddy .  newline newline tommy poured our tall foreigner a drink . he shifted in his seat , and spoke . newline newline  well , i was born in wisconsin . if you listen closely to my accent , it changes from russian , to vaguely german , to god know s what , but people do nt seem to mind . i moved away for college , and i was such a loser in high school ! my nerdy friends always told me i was good with accents , so first night of college i m drunk and nervous as hell , so i start putting on an accent to feel more confident around the ladies . before i know it , people know me as andrei from moscow . i m popular , man , real popular in college . so , i think fuck it , i m andrei now . doing my phd there now , still talking with this stupid accent . confuses the hell out of my mum when she calls .  newline newline andrei shook his head and downed his drink . tommy poured another round , as the storm raged on . newline newline let s jump forwards a bit now , to 11 months later . tommy is cleaning up the bar , when he notices someone has left a newspaper on one of the seats . he picks it up absentmindedly and a comic strip catches his eye . there s an image of four people sitting at a bar . tommy glances at the bottom corner , and there it is , ang lee . newline newline tommy smiles and pours himself a drink . they always buy that cindy story . newlinetravis could not believe his eyes . newline newline was it truly police lights he were seeing or was it a mirage of the pills he stole from that pharmacy yesterday ? newline newline he stops on the side of the road and steps out of his vehicle . newline a woman steps out and she is unbelievably gorgeous . newline newline  who the hell are you ?  , john screams .  alexis  , she replies in a smooth tone that does nt reflect any accent at all . newline newline  the speed limit is fiftyfive and i caught you doing eighty .  , she said with a small laugh . newline newline  what the hell is going on ?  , thought travis as he leaped straight upwards in his bed .  are you okay honey ?  asked his girlfriend alexis . newline newline  yeah i am alright , just had an odd dream that included me being the only person alive .  , he said with short quick breaths . maybe he had nt been alone in a world for years . newline newline newlinemalachi did not realize how weak the fire had become until he could no longer tell the difference between the night air and his bloodsoaked dagger . the bottom of his crudelyforged blade still flickered a faint orange , but most of it had vanished in front of his eyes in the preceding minutes . everyone else in the tribe had long since retired to their tents , resting in preparation of tomorrow s ceremony . snapping out of his trance , he placed two logs into the fire and pulled a deerskin rag from his pouch . if this dagger were to continue to serve him as well as it did tonight , he could not spare any effort in keeping it clean . besides , how could he neglect the one item in the world that he could call his own ? newline newline  newline   since you last laid your eyes on this stone , you have further devoted yourself to living as it wants us to . how great that our earth would bless us with such a reminder . we take our wisdom from this simple wonder of nature . at once both perfect and nothing , only those fully

it towards his eyes and inspect it closer . how much had he gone through for such a simple honor ? rolling it between his thumb and finger , he set it in front of his nose and used the light of the fire to see it more clearly . the rest of the tribe looked on in silent awe , wondering if they could ever become as strong as malachi . an ember cracked and burst from inside the fire , illuminating what malachi thought to be a small blemish on the stone . looking closer , he cracked a thin smile as the words  made in china  flickered out of focus just as quickly as they appeared . newline

it was with a harsh rasp . newline newline  you fucked up , jimbo .  newline newline jim nodded his head . there was nothing to say , really . he did fuck up . newline newline  we went over it tree

before them . newline henry , with his wisdom , then created a womb for the device to be created in . inside of the womb was an array of machines that henry taught each of the workers to use . the men

newline newline then henry and his men created millions of the device that would bring mankind back together . he gifted each of his workers handsomely for the gift that they had created for humanity

, he had let it really take hold of him . more so than one should . far more . newline newline newline his fingers went first . they split apart like if one was to take a sharp knife to a hotdog and so suddenly his hands were twenty , thirty , then fortyfingered messes . they turned blue and so it looked like his arms were masses of robin  s egg kelp or mildewed spaghetti . the blue shot up his arms , splitting them open where it touched . you could see the bone through jeremy  s flayed forearms and his skeleton quickly sprouted almost like mushrooms . his fingers congealed around the shoots of bone , stretching outward and up to the ceiling in a mess of ligaments and membranes . his clavicles popped out from the skin , spraying his mother  s limited edition vintage ford motor company  s  classics remembered  tablecloth with some kind of foul teal liquid . his head , then , with a lurch , became oval , then riddled with bulging veins , then almost translucent . he stretched out , with crackling and popping sounds , filling the height of the room with whipping tendrils and jagged appendages . opalescent , saffron , pale sky blue , turquoise , and other brilliant colors decorated the skin which tightly wrapped his torso and legs  which had undergone the same mitosislike division as his fingers and were now pillars of wormy tissue  . and as suddenly as the whole lurid orchestration of jeremy  s body into this grotesque new form had started , the musculature stopped twitching , the bones stopped growing , and the house loomed with a dark and unsettling presence . his parents emerged from the kitchen brandishing cooking knives and ladles , insisting repeatedly that help was on its way . jeremy wanted to assure them , more than any urge or impulse he had ever had , that everything was indeed fine , that this would be alright , that he supposed they would find out in due time what animal he was  for he couldn  t see himself that clearly with the absence of normalwavelength eyes  , and that they  d be on their way to a park sometime soon where they would frolic with other creatures , and so he concentrated as hard as he could on this idea , this concept of unity and family and oneness , and his great domed , transparent head pulsed a bit . newline newline newline  fathor , mothor ,  the voice rattled through their skulls , a violent echo of their son

front of the whole corona contingent !  newline newline  all i did was offer to put away the dishes .  newline newline  you re a princess now , not a scullery maid . that s what we have scullery maids for in the first place .  newline newline  well , excuse me for trying to help out as best i can . all i ve done growing up is care after my step family . caring after someone properly is the best way i know to show them that i love them . what do you expect me to do , just sit there and look pretty ?  newline newline  yes ! that s what a princess is supposed to do . my father already has misgivings about this whole marrying for love thing my mother coerced him to .  newline newline  your mother coerced ! is that why you married me ? there were a ton of other princesses at the ball . i m sure each one has spent their lives learning how to act and dress and talk like proper royalty .  newline newline  but they were nt you .  newline newline  and what about me do you like ? it s not my witty conversation skills or my repertoire of commoner jests . it s not my way with animals , and i have nt had a chance to use my singing voice in ages . it s certainly not my abilities in taking care of home and hearth . what is it that you love about me .  newline newline  ...  newline newline  of course . my overly large bosom . i saw where your eyes rested on for just that small moment . i should have suspected something when you had to search for me by having every young woman in the kingdom try on a shoe instead of remembering what my damn face looked like ! we only danced for the entire night . you should.. you should have known . marrying for love ? happiness ever after ? what was i thinking ? ugh.. if you need me , my lord , i shall be in my chamber practicing how to be a proper princess . i bid you good day and hope that my clumsy curtsy has not offended your grace . inquisitor malach strode purposefully down a cavernous corridor deep inside the imperial frigate the pious flame . as he walked he passed great marble and granite tableaus depicting noble champions and martyrs of the imperial guard and adeptus astartes . newline newline he had been summoned to the ship by captain titus of the imperial navy . some kind of xenos vessel had inexplicably materialised on his bridge during a routine mission , and what appeared to be a man had stepped out and demanded an audience with the captain , and was promptly taken into custody by a squad of the ship s detachment of imperial guard . newline newline malach approached a vast steel bulkhead , at his approach the lobotomised gun servitors embedded in the walls swivelled to regard him . black iron augmentations studded their puckered waxy skin , there was a pause as they scanned him . inquisitor malach of the

newline newline malach stepped through the cyclopean doorway and into the steelcold gloom of the pious flame s hold . there under harsh spot lights , and guarded by the towering power armour clad figures of malach s detachment of deathwatch space marines stood the xenos artefact . newline it was a simple wooden blue box , about 7 feet tall , with a single door on one side . it did nt look like any xenotech malach had seen before . newline in chains beside the blue box , beaten and bloody was what looked like a man , he was clad in preimperial clothing , and had a patient , wise demeanour . newline newline malach motioned the space marines to train their weapons on the captive . newline malach walked up to the captive , speak  he said . newline newline i m the doctor  said the captive looking at malach imploringly , and i m here to stop you from doing something terrible .  newline newline what terrible thing is this ?  sneered malach . newline newline this ship is orbiting a planet , the captain was planning to fire his weapons upon the planet and exterminate the civilisation living there .  newline newline malach smirked , well i should hope he would do such a thing , that planet is infested with filthy xenos , they deserve to die . they are a cancerous blight on the glory of the imperium . they must be purged .  newline newline the doctor balked at malach s casual attitude , the creatures down there are no threat to you , they have nt even developed the technology for interstellar travel !  newline newline they are xenos , they are a blight . they must be purged  newline newline they re creatures who live and love ! they have as much of a right to life as you ! open your mind !  newline newline malach leaned in close to the doctor , an open mind  , he said in a low growl , is like a fortress , with its gate unbarred and unguarded .  newline newline malach unclipped the vox unit from his belt , captain titus , commence exterminatus , cleanse the world in the name of the god emperor .  he said flatly . newline newline the doctor stared at him with wide eyes filled with horror , you just sentenced a billion souls to death .  he whispered in a hoarse tremulous voice . newline newline xenos are filth that must be scoured from the galaxy with fire and zeal .  malach said matteroffactly . newline he turned to one of the space marines , seargent , take care of this blasphemous xenolover , then summon the serfs to move the ... blue box to my ship for archiving . the emperor protects .  newline newline three meters tall , the sergeant clad in jet black power armour stomped up to the doctor and levelled his flamer . newline newline the blue pilot light winked into existence . newline newline the sergeant pulled the trigger and the

clear my throat and smile . my fingers smooth my hair . she looks up expectantly from her desk and i answer her . in turn her eyes travel my height , making note of my appearance , gleaning everything possible about me before telling me to sit . i pick up a magazine from the end table and pretend to go through its vacuous pages , estimating the number of seconds a sane human being might spend on each one before flipping to the next . newline newline i look at my wristwatch then i look at the clock . the receptionist is scrutinizing me . she must know i do nt wear a watch normally . why would someone wearing a timepiece also be inclined to look at a clock ? to check if they were synchronized ? no , she knows i am unfamiliar with this thin strap of leather , this feeble handcuff on my skin , bearing the face of mortality every time a person might just want to know whether they re going to make a train in the morning or have time to go to the bathroom before an interview . newline newline she calls my name . as i look up like a watchdog being fed she points to the door beside her . i rise to my feet and walk across the empty lobby , straightening my suit , feeling layered but oddly naked . newline newline  good luck ,  she says . newline newline  thank you ,  i say , wondering if she can hear an accent . newline newline once i am inside , there are no outside noises . the office has been completely soundproofed . i feel like the fish paddling about inside the large aquarium , suspended as if in space . they stare out the glass like prisoners . a large window behind the desk peers into those of the neighboring highrise , creating an endlessly selfreflecting domino effect among the skyscrapers . newline newline  come in , please , have a seat ,  says the man to whom the fish belong . newline newline i hang a bit over the desk to shake his hand , pushing my tie back with my other hand . i just hope the firmness of my grip is more noticeable than the sweating of my palm . as i sit down he peruses my resume , hmming and ahing to himself . but then he slides it aside . newline newline  so where are you from ?  he asks . newline newline for a moment darkness hangs in my mind . then a brilliant light fills that empty space as i understand his unusual question . i tell him where i am from . he is unimpressed . however something in his demeanor changes . he grows more relaxed , as if realizing i pose no threat . his hand reaches back over his chair and he shakes his head . newline newline  what are you doing all the way out here ?  newline newline again , i ca nt tell if the questions they ask in this place are supposed to cut as deep as they seem to . newline newline  i d like to be a part of the work you do . i feel like i could be of some considerable

do fastpaced ,  i say .  why would i want to be anywhere but where everyone else wants to be ? i just know i can do it better . i know i m the stronger candidate .  newline newline  sure , that s what they all say ,  he says , putting his fingertips together .  but what makes you different ?  newline newline  i m not sure i m trying to be ,  i say .  you need someone who can see things exactly the way everyone else can , who can understand the world through the eyes of an ordinary person , so people can relate . besides why would i want to be anything but what i am ?  newline newline he peers at me for a moment . the next thing i know i am in the bathroom , splashing cool water against my eyelids . i almost forgot i was wearing the glasses and i keep them aside . in the fluorescently lit bathroom i stare into the mirror . i can still hear the interviewer s last words as we shook hands : newline newline  welcome to the planet . i held the paper in my hands ... it shook , as my body trembled . newline a mix of disbelief , and wonder now filled my thoughts . was this true ? ..if it was the whole rebellion was to stop it was ? ... . the words failed me . newline newline i used my cell phone and called the relocators . soon they would take me away ... and i was glad . the rebels would be in disarray after their leader had gone . newline newline tears formed as i reread it , it

the dreamworld can be a scary place . you ca nt get hurt but if you stray too far you can get confused and it might be harder to distinguish what s part of the dreamworld and what s part of the real

same table along with his teeth and lips . his limbs have been long gone , days ago . i take my time . after all , that s all we have now is time . i give him a look of indifference as i toss the

skills as a serial killer would pay off in the end . this poor fool raped an entire family , father mother ... the kids . in the days before the elixer he would have simply been put to death . now

way down the sterile hospital hallway to room 306 . my mother s room . illness had taken her livelihood , and it would win in the end it seemed . even the nurses who cared for her , smiling and

this curse , and it seems to have stuck with both her and myself . i myself did not know much of the curse , aside from my own harebrained scheme to keep me from forgetting vital objects . newline newline she turned to one side in the bed and began to speak .  actually there is something that could be done about things forgotten , we ve been trying for years . the person who laid this curse on

 newline newline panic seeped in . she frantically checked under her pillow , the table next to her bed , tore her sheets from the bed with a strength i did nt know she was capable of . newline newline  i forgot .  hey , remember me ?  newline newline i felt a weird sense of recognition , sitting in my sofa , the t.v muted . a brief feeling of nostalgia washed over me as i tried to locate where it came from .  hey , do nt tell me you ve forgotten me . we used to be friends !  the voice seemed to be coming closer and had a weird quality to it , as if it was rusty . i twisted in my seat in a futile attempt to find it . newline newline slowly , i heard something shifting underneath my couch . a shadow seemed to be pulling itself from underneath , inching out from the cramped sofa . at this point , a cold terror began to wash over me , pinning me to my seat . the shadow unfolded itself and once it came into the dim light of the living room bulb , i noticed it was no shadow at all . it was a child , perfectly normal , except for the fact it had buttons for eyes . it s features felt wrong , as if they had been though up by a lonely , unimaginative kid . it smiled happily at me . newline newline  we used to be such good friends ,  the creature pouted .  but then you forgot about me ,  it said softly , and i felt ice through my heart . but then the monster s eyes widened and it flashed me another wide grin , trying to make me forget .  you were a bad boy but that does nt mean we ca nt still be friends !  it laughed in a singsong trill . i felt a dash of hope . if i could please it enough , perhaps it would leave me and return to the nightmare world it crawled from . newline newline  yyeah ,  i spoke , my voice shaken with fear . the creature smiled even wider but then it s face went smooth . newline newline  but bad boys have to be punished and you were a very bad boy .  hope fled from my body , leaving more space for fear . newline newline  ppplease !  i whimpered , near tears . the monster replied with a dark , dark smile and in it s hands were some string , needles and two buttons . newline newlinebefore he retired , robert would always come to work with a

. he would never let them feel outofplace , though , building for them a spot in the garden among friendly neighbours . robert made sure that all the plants were happy . newline newline one day , robert didn  t come to his garden . he didn  t come the next day either . one of his many children visited him that day , something his children did often , to find him , hands still covered in dirt

rosebush , now the largest single plant in his garden . newline newline and still , not a single thorn grew . newline newline the funeral was a small affair , and not too sad , for robert had lived a

article . apparently he had seen it too . he asked me if i had recently taken the life of anything , and that s when it clicked . i got back from my tour in afghanistan last week , that is when this

was a hand on my shoulder , pressing me down   i felt the gravel cut into my knees . a metallic voice filled my ears . newline newline  i need you to understand something before i kill you .  newline newline i sucked in a sharp breath , remembering the firefight . they had secreted themselves in the floor of a hold filled with refugees , keeping us from detecting them till the attack started . after the initial forces rose up outside the walls , those in the refugee transport emerged , slaughtering all before them . i was assigned to the infirmary and stood as long as i could . i fought off dozens before a blinding light filled my vision and i awoke on my knees with a voice in my ear . newline newline  i need you to understand something ,  the voice said again . a white helmet was set on the ground beside me .  i have studied your kind for as long as i can remember ,  the voice was soft and warm without the metallic tint of the helmet .  i have spoken to some of your most revered shamen . i have seen copies of the tome of your greatest wisdom and handled artifacts of your ancients .  newline newline i tensed my legs and instantly a cold circle touched my neck .  do not move , monk .  the voice was hard , devoid of the emotion that was there moments before . i relaxed my legs . the cold circle disappeared and the warm voice returned . newline newline  i understand and , given a chance , i think i would join you .  he took a deep breath . newline newline  but they are evil , and strong , young monk . and i am among them .  the cold circle returned . newline newline i heard blaster fire and my vision went red , then black . newline newline my sight returned in a flash . i saw an armored figure reach across my body and pick up his helmet . he looked over his shoulder and met my eyes . then he placed the helmet on his head . the metallic voice returned . newline newline  i am sorry , young jedi . i have no choice . may the force be with you .  newline

.time has no relevance nor place , no purpose nor benefit . the measure of such is a concept developed by mortals and lesser beings . the rules of time and its measure are meaningless and only hold to an ancient and forgotten place . the distance between now and then is the same as now and tomorrow . it is merely to exist , and by this maxim we do . newline newline to be a judge for some eternal existence is pointless , yet this is my task . i do not know how this charge was pressed upon me , but i still carry the weight of it . all humanity has been judged , and all humanity is unaware of this fact . in the absence of time , the judgement is instant and permanent . the weight of  sins  and  righteousness  have already been declared and recorded . newline newline as it is that i am the judge , i am also unable to pass a sentence unto myself without knowing that it i can change it . in this paradox , my actions were only just , and according to the guidelines i created , i can do no wrong . if there is none above me , then i must be supreme and devoid of error . as it has already been decided , and there is no decision of myself , i am granted godhood . newline newline i have always been and will always be . time is not my master , but closer to that of an accomplice or an effect of my very existence . to you it is moving , but for me it is unchanged and there is no measure of it . in the absence of this concept of yours , i exist in all time and see it all in one glimpse . newline newline you ask me to judge myself ? why should i do this ? how would you know that this could even be done , and if it was how would you know ? in my omniscient view of worldly things , i can look to the time that your history has yet to be written and it will be a memory . i

s bane , attempted to pull off a series of attacks that would have taken thousands of lives and left the city in shambles . dr. probability called in the threat and based off his ability was able to direct authorities to the probable locations the dragon  s bane would strike . as always he was right . a few of the terrorists deviated from their plans and some were able to do damage before taken down . in all 47 were injured , and 1 was killed . though the city sends their best support to those grieving families , many are grateful nothing worse came to city of nearly half a million . newline newline when dr. probability entered the police cruiser , he was being taken once again to city hall to shake hands with the mayor . except this time when he arrived downtown , he was arrested under probable cause he knew of the attack and maybe even had a hand in orchestrating it . newline newline  how did you know there was going to be an attack ? ! ? !  detective reeves yelled slamming his fists on the table  tell me know !  dr. probability looked the detective in the eyes .  last week db made a threat against our nation . given our mayor  s recent speech condemning dragon  s bane , there was a probability of 33 in 40 that we would be the next target . i then went to our herbert park and waited for signs of an impending attack . this afternoon i saw a van pull up and explosives being subtly unloaded . i then called the authorities and advised of the other probable locations.   bullshit !  detective reeves exclaimed ,  after every catastrophic event . you are always there at the center of all . the whole city thinks you  re a hero.  detective reeves took a mocking tone ,  there is a 1 in 3 chance that this bank will be robbed at noon , there is a 4 in 9 chance the chief of police is having an affair ,  the detective began reverting back to his angry tone  there is a 87 in 88 chance i have been bullshitting you all ! the other officers might eat your shit all day , but i don  t buy it ! ! !  the detective slammed his fists against the metal desk again . newline newline dr. probability was unfazed by the detective  s tone . people often get angry at things that they do not understand .  you are a detective correct ? what would i have to gain if what you claim is true ?  detective reeves took the chair across the table .  oh i don  t know . book deals , money , fame , glory , woman , power !  dr. probability sighed  but do i have any of those things ? i mean , a college professor and statistician , which statistically pays better than the average salary . but in world of mega celebrities and billion dollar companies , i am much closer to the average person . fame , sure , but it is usually followed by a joke or snarky remark . glory , don  t make laugh , most of the world labels me as a freak and my peers label me as a fraud . woman , another laughable idea , i  m nearly 65 years old and i  ve never married . i can  t even remember the last time i went on a date . and to your last point power.  dr. probability stopped talking and lifted up his arms that were now handcuffed . reeves had been so sure , he had rehearsed this speech a thousand times for his supervisors , for his peers , and in his mirror . however now he stood across the table from the man he accused of all these disasters and he saw that he couldn  t possible be the cause of it all . newline newline  how did you know the locations ?  the detective asked looking disappointedly at the one way mirror . dr. probability perked back up  well . herbert park is our largest public space and would no doubt be their priority target . i counted 15 from the dragon  s clan , which would put their numbers between 100145 . then i went through a list in my head of large public spaces that had high foot traffic that had ease of access with little security . after that it was simple statistics.  the detective opened the folder and started going through a list of standard questions .  after spotting the terrorists how long was it until you called authorities.  there was a silence after that question . the detective looked up and saw what looked like dr. probability counting in his head .  i called after 1 minute and 13 seconds from seeing them pull up in their black truck.  the detective looked up ,  when you called you gave dispatch all the location the locations they would strike.  dr. probability nodded  yes indeed ! that took me three seconds to calculate.  newline newline the detective closed the folder .  but you didn  t save everyone.  dr. probability frowned and looked down .  no sadly in the terrorists attempt to escape or carry out their mission they injured 47 and took 1 life . but it could have been worse much worse . a city of 437,769 , to only have 48 lives immediately affected is pretty good i think.  the detective was now watery in his eyes , dr. probability did not notice .  just 48 ? what about those who knew the victims.  dr. probability put his hand on his chin .  ah yes . 48 people , each probably had a circle of friends and family of about 60 . 2880 lives affected by the tragedy . still on the grand scheme of things , life should resume back to equilibrium of normality in the next 17 hours.  the detective got angry again  17 hours ! ? ! ? that  s how long it will take people to get over this.  just then another officer came into the room .  well that of course is an average . some were not even emotionally affected where for others it could take years to recover from this afternoon  s events.  newline newline the other detective grabbed detective reeves and moved him towards the door . the other officer spoke next .  alright mark , you have a had long day . let  s take some time  dr. probability stood up and interrupted the other officer .  excuse me . what was the name of the woman that lost her life this afternoon ?  the other detective spoke again  susan reeves.  dr. probability sighed .  i see detective reeves  s wife.  dr. probability looked at the detective .  detective reeves i  m assuming that is your wife . i  m sorry she is no longer with us . i  m sure she was a great woman and she will be missed , but due to an unforeseen series of events she was taken from us . though yes , i use my power to prevent many lives from being lost , i am not able to save everyone.  detective reeves turned back around with dried tears in his eyes and unlocked dr. probability  s handcuffs .  you are right . even though you do your best , this world is unpredictable . you shouldn  t be held guilty for that what you can  t predict.  newlinethrough the desert he dragged the sleigh with its precious cargo . past broken cities , forgotten and buried by the sands and the wind that howled day and night through abandoned castles and homes . there was no life  not trees or birds or people , save the bones now charred and brittle , the flesh burned off them ages ago . as the lonely traveler climbed another dune , struggling to pull the load behind him , the sands shifted and a mighty wing broke free of the grip of the sands . newline newline  who goes ?  the beast that emerged rumbled , more smoke than from a hundred campfires billowing out of its flaming nostrils . the traveler bowed , his mighty black sword untouched in its scabbard . newline newline  a humble traveler , and i think i have something that belongs to you ,  he said quietly , his voice barely audible over the scream of the wind . he had followed the path of burned cities and crumbled ruins to find the lair of this mighty beast that now stood before him in all its glory . the egg he dragged glowed redder each day as the sun beat down mercilessly upon traveler and cargo alike . newline newline  it appears you may ,  the beast murmured , lowering its head to rest on the sand , staring the traveler in the eyes .  your name , brave traveler ? or perhaps you are foolish ?  the man smiled , a twinkle in his eye . newline newline  brave , perhaps , but foolish i am not . you are an honorable creature , mighty beast , or so the legends say . i have brought you your child , and now you have a debt to pay .  he was well aware that he walked a thin line . the beast could char him to ashes before he could even reach for his mighty sword to protect himself . forged in the fire blown by a dragon from whose embers a phoenix emerged , the sword split fire as easily as if it were flesh . but the sword lay uselessly in his scabbard and if he so much as moved a hand towards it , he would become the beast s next meal .  my name is kaitou of the house of the dragonlords and i come seeking your help .  newline newline the creature pensively blew a plume of fire , as tall as a dozen men , and stomped its massive feet , each the size of a castle .  very well , kaitou of the dragonlords . what do you request of me in exchange for my unborn child ?  the egg trembled and minuscule cracks had formed in the presence of the unbearable heat of the beast s lair . newline newline  my family prepares to wage war against the eastern kingdom in the land across the sea . i request you , and any brothers you may have , to fight alongside me to defeat this false king who has claimed the lands that in ancient times belonged to my family .  kaitou gulped , aware of the fate of thousands of men that hung in the balance , dependent on the answer of this mighty beast . newline newline the beast stirred again , kicking up a small sandstorm as he shuffled a massive foot .  very well , kaitou of the house of the dragonlords . i will ride with you in gratitude for returning my child .  the egg had hatched now , and a smaller beast had emerged . smaller though it was , it towered over kaitou , standing as tall as three men . newline newline across the eastern sea in the heart of the eastern kingdom , the king shuddered as reports of a mighty beast aligned with his enemies trickled in . it was said to dwarf his castle ten times stacked and could boil the blood of ten thousand men with a single blow of its firebreath . newline newline  tidings of war , your grace ?  his trusted adviser and sired knight asked . the king nodded , turning away from the castle balcony that faced the eastern sea . newline newline  call the lords and prepare the men . we ride against the dragonlords and this beast of theirs .  newline newline  newline newline thanks for reading ! if you enjoyed this , please check out more stories at rmatiwrites . constructive criticism

the window to my right and i felt uneasy , not because i was going to die , but because i always thought that the world around me would stop when i reached my final hours , i thought that every bird would stop moving , the people would stop their daily routines , but it was nt like that . people died every day and the world kept going , but this time was my turn . newline newline i mean , the first months after being diagnosed was a surreal experience . in those days i was still able to walk and i used to jog around the park waiting for a sign , something that made me feel that i mattered , that i was special and that it was impossible for me to die just like that . one day i was eating chinese with joanne and the next one i was recieving chemo . newline newline it was getting harder to draw breath and my fingers were already slipping through the fabric when i noticed a man staring out of the same window i was just seconds before . newline too young to die , are nt ya ? i ve seen

newline but , there s a catch . after you re done with them 5 years , you ll have to come with me .  the grin on his face was barely noticeable and i knew what he meant as the words faded into the small room in which i was barely alive . newline joanne , i missed her already . her smile was the brightest star and her eyes the finest diamonds . i still could picture her broken spirit and those diamonds about to crack . i missed her so much already . newline newline that s my boy , see you around and try not to get killed before those 5 years  newline i clenched the sheets with my fist and

newline newline i know how we get , so i knew he was beyond reasoning with at this point and just needed to get it off his chest . i tried to think about something else as he ranted on . newline newline 5 years ago , everyone had voted . there was too much violence , too much division ... the only thing we all knew for certain was our world would forever be on a doomed path of war and

. newline newline he was shouting now .  who are we ? what asshole did they use to make the template ? the one that made us all the same ? where is the fucking lazy , prideful , jealous , emotional

knocks two times on the door , a buzzing sound cuts through the air and the door opens . the man steps in , he walks down a hallway passing a lounge area with black leather sofas and a bar that only sells expensive whiskey . some of the patrons are slouched in the sofas , drool dripping down their chins , open wine bottles , glasses half full , most of them wear thick visors with cords that link in a little socket in their necks . this is where the rich come to preview the merchandise . the man gets to another door and stops , in the corner a camera with a red blinking light zooms in on him the lenz shrinks and expands and then stops , more buzzing , the door opens . he steps into the room . its small , nothing in it only one table and two chairs in the middle , a light bulb hanging on a

hoover across the floor , dripping wet the duster glossy with water , he sits down . they sit for a while staring at eachother , as if in some kind of mind reading game , finally the asian man clears his throat and says  do you have it ?  . the man in the duster grunts and pulls out a small black disk and puts it on the table . the asian man slides his hand over and grabs it , he wipes it off and puts it in the drive . the computer starts to come alive with beeps and fans starting up , the asian man looks at the screen for a moment , suddenly he cringes his eyes wide , then he starts to smile

on the wooden table , few cracks formed , a bouncer came rushing in but the asian man waved him of . newline newline  fine , just give me the credits  newline newline the asian man went to his pocket and grabbed a credit pad with a fixed amount on it and slid it over . newline newline the man stood up and grabbed it in one motion , he turned and walked towards the door but just before he reached

switching from elf to dwarf , then back again . the elf smiled as he realized what zi was doing , causing the dwarf to grimace . newline newline  i may be short , but i can plant an axe in you just as easy as i could get an elven woman .  the dwarf said , ale spilling as he made arm gestures to accompany the words .  which is to say , very easy .  newline newline zi laughed out loud and looked around .  what s your name ?  newline newline  maybe i ll tell you later .  the dwarf said . newline newline  kael ,  the elf replied . newline newline  i m zi .  the wizard stood and looked around the tavern .  no one else ? room for one more in d and d !  newline newline an orc walked over , a weak smile on his hideous face . newline newline  no way , not gon na happen ,  kael said in a confident tone .  i ve played d and d with orcs before . you people do not take losing well .  newline newline  fine !  he rumbled .  i do nt want to play with you anyway !  newline newline zi looked away from the orc with a forced smile . the wizard pretended he could nt see the tears forming in tall gray orc s eyes , instead shifting to face the gameboard .  so , let s play !  newline newline   newline newline  no fair ,  the unnamed dwarf slammed a fist into the table , knocking a chunk of wood to the ground . his dice was still resting on the center , the number 4  clearly showing .  the orc was starin  at me !  newline newline zi turned and saw an orc s head quickly duck behind a chair . shaking his head , he once again faced the board .  well , i do nt see how that would affect your dice roll . anyway , instead of completing lisa s work for her and earning her trust , you do nt finish anything and have to stay overtime .  newline newline  look ere , you dumb wiz  newline newline  my turn yet ?  kael asked , boredom evident in his voice .  or will we wait for another species to form an empire and overtake this one ?  newline newline the elf s hand grabbed the die and began shaking , before even deciding on an action , letting it loose with practiced ease . before the dice came to a rest , a gray and scarred hand grabbed it .  i ca nt play ?  newline newline it was the orc . newline newline  i ll show you how i play .  the orc let the dice fall out of his hand and it sat still with the number 1  showing .  ah !  newline newline the orc s axe slammed into the center of the table , sharpened side cutting through as if it were elven silk . newline newline the tavern grew quiet as eyes turned to the orc . as though he only just realized what he d done , the orc smiled again and backed away slowly , two steps , before turning and sprinting out the door . newline newline zi blinked . then he turned to the serving girl .  i ll have another pint .  newline newline  make that two !  the unnamed dwarf called . newline newline  i got the pint to share for us all ,  i said . newline newline  oh .  the dwarf looked to the serving girl again .  make it three ! luke had grown up watching all the popular superhero shows . the avengers , the justice league , all that good stuff . he d loved them all , until about the age of ten , when he had found out his own father was a real superhero . from that moment no other superhero mattered to him , only his daddy . he drew pictures and wrote stories , all of his time was spent idolising his own father . but as time went on and he got older his outlook gradually changed . the image he had in his head of his father , clad in a colourful outfit dissipated at the image of him coming home battered and bloodied in tattered everyday clothes . his drawings of his father turning criminals over to the police were burned when he watched him washing blood that was not his own from his hands and face . his dreams of one day being a superhero himself were forever gone when he looked into his father s eyes , and realised he hated what he had to do every day . newline newline and so , at the age of sixteen , when his abilities began to manifest , he did everything he could to hide them . it was nt easy . his father told him that in every superhuman he knew , all of their abilities came with a downside . luke s ability had manifested in the form of superhuman strength . having a power alone was bad enough in his eyes , but the inherent negative side to his power was that he got angry a lot faster , and felt rage with much more intenisty than any normal person would . and for someone still going to secondary school , there were a lot of opportunities to get angry . newline newline in fact , he could feel the rage building right now . it was too much . his jaw was clenched so tight , every muscle in his body tensing up . his blood was boiling . his jaw unclenched , and he heard a scream . was it his , or did it come from someone else ? he saw red . then black . newline when he came to , he still saw red . but he was nt angry . no , there was blood everywhere . on his clothes , the floor , all over his hands . he was stood over the body of another student . one of the other people in his class . his body was mangled and twisted in an unnatural position . he had killed him . he had killed him , and for what ? a snide comment ? he knew this would happen . he did nt want this . he was a monster . he would have to run , have to hide . no one could ever know . newlineit was a normal first day for north washington highschool . students grudgingly dragged their feet to class , mumbling careless hellos  to friends , each one more despondent at the end of summer as the other . some , of course , had to be awoken with water from their blissful asleep , as evidenced by their wet hair . it was today , however , that things were going to change . the queen bitch , heather , strut around her kingdom , gathering kisses and trinkets of admiration from every man who saw her , and jealousyfilled hellos  from every woman . many had assumed that heather s regime would last a lifetime  in high school terminology that meant 4 years .  it was , much to their surprise , that today she would be overtaken from her perch . newline newline  excuse me ?  asked heather , looking rather disgusted at a fellow student in cardigan . newline newline  yyes ?  answered the poor victim . newline newline  you re fat .  newline newline  huh  newline newline  oh sorry , i did nt mean it to come out that way it s just ... this is my locker , and you re kinda blocking it .  newline newline  i ll move .  answered the shocked student whose name , up until now , escaped the minds of everyone watching the spectacle unfold . newline newline  yeah see . i m a busy girl , and i do nt really have time to keep telling you every time to move when it s obvious , unless you rent out a gymmembership , that you ca nt really help it . how about you ask the teacher to switch ?  newline newline the girl , mumbling something incoherent was left alone after heather walked away , telling her  thanks , doll !  newline newline all of the sudden , as heather was walking away , the doors of the school flung wideopen , revealing a flurry of wind that almost ruined heather s perfect hair . the sun obscured who stood defiant at the door , but everyone quickly recognised the figure as that of a new student . little did they know that this newcomer shall herald the dawn of the new era , and that the age of heather shall fall beneath her feat . this was the new saviour . this was jessica .interior , winterfell s great hall newline newline jon , sansa , sam , and jorah are all sitting

newline sam : you mean the one that says  danger ?  newline newline jorah : i thought that newline newline the wildling returns with a masked man who is of short height . newline newline wildling :

yeah . newline newline end . newline newline edit : i made some changes to the format that might make for an easier read .the alarm clock went off . time to get started . i hopped off of the mattress that was laying on the floor of a dusty old apartment . quickly , i searched around for a wallet . looking down i confirmed that today i was indeed a male . good , that s what i was used to . newline newline my name is thomas , and since i was 15 years old , i have gone to sleep and awoken as a different person . i do nt know what happens to the people s souls for the day that i am in their body ... maybe they are me for a day . old me . thomas . the me  that i have nt been in 10 long years . newline newline found the wallet . gregory sampson was the name on the id . awesome . where does greg work ? i found a newspaper with circled job offers in it . one of them circled in red ink as opposed to black like the others . greg s body was tired and weak , but my soul remained strong . for the last four years i had tried to improve my hosts  lives for the day that i occupied their bodies . after about three years i had debated suicide to end this ordeal , but to steal someone s life ? i could nt bring myself to do such a thing , so i continued on . newline newline the circled job offer was at 10 am , i was running out of time . rushing to find greg s closet i picked up on many aspects of his life . nice , old golf clubs , a large tv , fairly expensive appliances . greg was either a former wealthy man or had terrible priorities . i found his closet and quickly threw on the best suit he had . there were many , maybe he really had been wealthy and lost his home . reduced to this dump . newline newline a quick shower , a decent amount of his cheap cologne and i was off to find this place that greg wanted to work at so badly . i could feel the pressure mounting . i obviously did nt know greg , but i wanted to do the best i could at making sure his life would continue as normal or better than before i came along . newline newline finally i arrived at the building  an expensive looking place . stayed patiently in the waiting room and was called in after about ten minutes . i opened the door to the office and there she sat behind her desk . the most beautiful woman i had ever seen . i stopped a bit , all confidence i had  gone . i was suddenly nervous and unsure of myself . a deep breath . newline newline  mr. sampson  she said with a smile .  please , have a seat .  newline  thank you .  i said as i took the chair on the opposite side of the desk . i extended my hand  well , aas you know i am gregory , you can call me greg  newline  yes , you told me that yesterday on the phone .  newline shit  oh , yes , sorry i forgot .  newline newline she laughed a beautiful laugh .  that s alright , and as you know i am ms. wever but you can call me sarah .  she shook my hand and winked . mischievously . with that my heartrate skyrocketed . newline  so shall we get down to business ?  i asked . newline  of course .  she turned her bright blue eyes to her computer screen while clearing a few strands of dirty blonde hair out of her eyes . i watched her every move , like i was studying her for a research project . i wanted to know her , the real her . what was sarah like when she was alone , what was she like around someone she loved and trusted ? my mind drifted to the obvious thought of what she looked like naked . not in a perverted fashion , but in a caring and loving one . i had inhabited enough female bodies that i had become accustom to them , they were no longer interesting for me ... but she was different . newline newline  you re credentials are very impressive greg . tell me , why do you think you deserve this position . newline newline the interview went smoothly . i got her to laugh quite often . she even slapped my hand in a playful manner across the desk while laughing after i cracked a somewhat inappropriate joke . i was nt nervous anymore , not in the least bit . newline newline on the way back to greg s apartment , his phone rang . newline  hello ?  newline  greg ?  newline  ms. wev sarah !  newline  you ve got the position greg , can you start monday ?  newline  of course ... of course i can !  newline  very well , congratulations , i look forward to working with you .  newline  likewise .  i hung up and blasted the radio in greg s car . i was in heaven . newline newline then , i remembered . this was not my life . i would never see sarah again , and when greg came in to work on monday , he would nt be the same person . he would be greg , not thomas . i turned the radio off and drove back the rest of the way in silence . newline newline upon arriving at his apartment , i quickly ran inside and got to work . i found a pad and paper and began to recite every little detail of the meeting on the paper . after i finished leaving every tip i could think of i left him this one last message . newline newline my name is thomas , and my soul has been drifting to a different person somewhere in the world every day for the last 10 years . perhaps i ll see you again , as a friend of yours , a relative , even sarah . while it is unlikely , if i do see you , i ll let you know that it is me  thomas . good luck in life , and good luck with sarah if you choose to pursue her . i would die to be you for the rest of my life . it s simple , i m in love , but as soon as i wake from my next sleep , i will be someone else . fair well , gregory sampson newline newline it was similar to every other message i left people , but i had never connected with anyone while parading around in someone else s body . i forced myself to go to sleep even though it was only about 1:30 pm . newline newline newline i woke up to the sound of sirens and gunfire here we goa thousand years ago , my order was destroyed by fools who did not realize what it did for them . now , i have been chosen to join the order and restore it to its former glory . and the first step in doing so will be to expose and destroy the order that destroyed mine . newline newline i already have my plan in mind . arrange for an army to come to this republic s aid when it is invaded . prove myself during the war and eventually rise to the top . when i am trusted , expose the treacherous order s secrets . they will not stop me , for they believe my order exterminated . my army will bring them into custody and destroy the means they have used to maintain power . then , and only then , will i be able to bring true order and governance to the galaxy . newline newline edit : word you want some coffee or something ?  newline newline i turned and stared blankly at the gay burglar restrained uncomfortably on the kitchen floor of my shithole apartment , a small trickle of blood creeping down from his gay hairline onto the bridge of his gay nose . he did nt look gay , but then again i do nt know how somebody would look gay in all black sweats and a skull cap . i found myself idly wondering if he dressed ... i do nt know , gayer , i guess , when he was nt out burglarizing shitty apartments on new year s eve . newline newline i mean that in the literal sense , by the way . the man was flaming . he had been on the phone out in the hallway with somebody shortly before i conked him over the head with a skillet in my living room . he had that weird lisp that some of them seem to like using . took a couple swings to get him to the floor . he had a lot of foul things to say , too , in between meetings of cast iron and gay skull that is . i d never met a straight guy who spoke like that so i figured it was safe to assume that he was pitching for the other team . i do nt just call everything i do nt like gay  like i m some kind of eighth grader in the late nineties . which is nt to say i did nt like him  he seemed nice enough for a burglar  it s just he was rummaging through the box of old stuff that seth had left for me before he ate a shotgun shell last september , and i had nt even looked into that box yet for fear of what emotional pain i might find in there , and it was pretty upsetting to see a complete stranger , who never even met him , putting his stupid little fingers all over ... you get the point . moving on . newline newline  ah , right . do nt suppose you d be able to drink it from down there .  plus his mouth was gorilla taped shut so i guess i m not even really sure why i asked . i stared blankly at him for a moment , unsure of what else to say . it suddenly occurred to me that this was the sort of thing people were talking about when they mentioned  a pregnant pause  . or maybe not . whatever . he looked terrified . i felt bored . i had just been robbed the week before . caught that one , too , although i d been more afraid at the time and called 911 while hiding in the bedroom closet . the second time around felt more like a mild annoyance than anything , really . i d been having trouble feeling much of anything recently . newline newline i turned back to the leaky piece of dollar store shit that passed for a coffee maker around my place , absentmindedly spooning grounds into the filter basket and mashing a pudgy finger into the cheap on  button . the led did nt light up . probably broken like everything else in my life . the rest of the coffee maker seemed to be functioning well enough , though , which was lucky . it was probably going to be a long night and i did nt feel much like sleeping anyway . the bed i used to share with jocelyn was even less appealing than the couch i found daisy dead on , and so i had resigned myself to a small recliner near the window until i either stopped feeling weird about the rest of my shitty furniture or else just burned the whole miserable goddamn building to the ground . whichever came first . newline newline jesus christ , what a fucking horrible bitch . who confesses an affair to their boyfriend of 4 years , the same day his cat dies , and then just leaves immediately ? i barely even had time to respond . she was already packed up and ready to go by the time i got home from another day of fruitless job hunting and dodging phone calls from debt collectors . the combined weight of the last few weeks had piled up high enough to snap something in my psyche . i simply did not fucking care anymore . about anything , really . i had felt nothing at all lately except for a dull , bored sort of a misery . fucking jocelyn . an image of her curled up and smiling by a nice fireplace somewhere with steve flashed through my mind s eye . fucking steve . newline newline the coffee loudly sputtered and then fell silent . i found myself staring at the burglar . it suddenly occurred to me that i d probably just been standing there staring at him for an entire brew cycle . his eyes were frantically darting around the room like they had fucking motors attached to them and he was starting to sweat pretty profusely . poor dumb bastard probably thought i was gon na kill him or something . i still had nt bothered calling the police . i turned away and poured some coffee into a chipped and stained old mug , wondering what i should do with him . there d been a whole mess of statements and paperwork when this happened last week and i was feeling far too apathetic to do all of that again . to be honest , i did nt really care if the guy got arrested or not . he looked to be on the verge of shitting himself and probably had a fuck of a headache from that skillet so i doubted he d be coming back any time soon . i walked purposefully over to his tense , sweaty body and ripped the tape off his mouth . newline newline  pleasepleaseimsorryillgoillnevercomebackill  newline newline  oh for fuck s sake , shut up ,  i said , suddenly regretting taking the tape off .  i m not going to hurt you . what s your name ?  newline newline  ... steve .  newline newline fucking steve . had to be a fucking steve . i sighed and pressed the tape back over his mouth . if he d had any name other than fucking steve , i probably would ve felt bad about using the gorilla tape instead of normal duct tape . that was powerful stuff . probably hurt like a bitch coming off . luckily the guy did nt have a mustache . or at least i did nt think he did . i ripped the tape off a second time and inspected his upper lip . no mustache . no mustache on the tape either . pressing the strip of black tape back over his mouth , i reached around and patted his pockets , not quite sure what i was looking for but not sure what else to do either . back right pocket , large square lump . a brief halfsmile snuck it s way across my face at the thought of a burglar being dumb enough to bring his own goddamned wallet with him on a burglary . probably had his real id in there and everything . newline newline  you know , you re not very good at this burglary stuff , steven .  i said without looking at him .  can i call you steven ? i m not a big fan of steve  , personally .  newline newline he nodded violently as i rifled through his wallet , removing his state id and a small stack of twenties and tens . newline newline  steven schubert , 1026 peregrine lane . blue eyes , blond hair ...  i trailed off as i flipped it over to read the back .  ... organ donor ! nice of you , steven . my father s on the waiting list for a liver , you know . or i assume he still is , anyway . have nt heard from him in a few years now . the guy s a dick . too bad you ca nt specify but not for alcoholic shitbirds  when you consent to the whole donor thing , huh ?  newline newline i stared intently at some indistinct spot on the old linoleum floor for a moment , remembering my father s dickery . i had nt thought about him in months . fucking dad . newline newline oh right , burglar thing , forgot for a second . newline newline  here s the deal , steven  i said calmly .  i am having an absolute fuck of a bad week and if i have to spend half my night talking to a bunch of cops and writing boring statements again , i swear i ll snap . and to be honest , i just really do nt give a shit . sorry about the skillet . i was upset . i m sure you have a concussion . definitely gon na wan na stay awake for tonight , and go to the hospital if you start to feel sick or anything , ok ?  newline newline he nodded violently again . he seemed to relax a bit , though he was still sweating bullets . kind of making a mess of my shitty floor , frankly . i walked over to the counter and removed a small paring knife from where it sat in the block . newline newline  i m going to cut you loose , and you re going to go home , got it ?  newline newline more violent nodding . newline newline  i m keeping the cash from your wallet . sorry . looks like enough to cover jocelyn s half of the rent this month and i could really use it .  newline newline i squatted down beside him , cutting his ankles and wrists free of the tape and he scrambled for the door , mouth still taped shut . i was nt gon na remove the mouth tape anyway  gorilla tape is tough shit and i actually did feel a little bad for ripping it off twice already . not to mention the whole skillet thing . he could do it himself now that his hands were free . newline newline mildly amazed at how numb i still felt , i went to the living room and sat quietly in the recliner as scattered fireworks began to pop off outside . must be midnight , i thought . newline newline fucking new year s . newline newline edited for typos and some other dumb mistakes newline newline newline newlineso , a couple days late . but i liked the prompt and had nt done one of these before so i thought i d give it a try . any feedback would be appreciated  i ve checked but i do nt doubt that there will be some grammar issues so feel free to point those out too  :  . newline newline newline we open up in a club . in the centre there a group of boys crowded around a table , cheering , dancing and drinking . newline newline narrator : in the great island of great britain  redundancy intended  there are many forms university students . here we observe the male university students in their natural habitat : the club . we can see elder members of the pack torturing their young  otherwise known as a fresher  into performing ludicrous acts in order to garner their approval in a process which is known as : hazing . newline newline the fresher downs a drink while the other boys look on and chant newline newline narrator : the fresher has been pressured into ingesting several doses of harmful toxins at the continual behest of the rest of his pack . as a result of this we see that the fresher has become rather disorientated yet has increased level of misguided confidence . newline newline in walks a girl who is focused on her phone at the far side of the club . the fresher notices her and moves to the front of the table to admire her . newline newline narrator : aha , from afar he spots a desirable female . in order to get her attention he distances himself from the pack and moves over to the dance floor in solitude . a risky manoeuvre . he then begins his mating dance , for a definite chance of romance he decides to incorporate many thrusting motions and finger guns . very impressive but it would seem no one is watching . newline newline the fresher beckons one the boys over and whispers in his ear . the other boy smiles and confidently walks over to the girl and they begin talking . newline newline narrator : the fresher calls over one of his brothers . ah yes , the wingman technique . in order to ensure his chances of copulation with the female he sends his friend over to the female in the hopes of boasting about his best traits . newline newline the girl is shocked by whatever it is the boy had said and slaps him . newline newline narrator : oh no it would appear the fresher chose poorly as his wingman has turned out to be a kamikaze pilot . newline newline the boy walks away and back towards the pack . the pack all look at him questionably . he then motions back to the girl as if to say  guys apparently it  s lesbian night  . they all laugh and he  s accepted back into the fold . newline newline narrator : feeling dejected the fresher has no choice but to go back to his pack in the hopes of winning back the admiration of peers by buying them all a round . oh wait ! what  s this ? the fresher is heading towards the female on his own , in one last attempt ! this is a bold strategy indeed . they are conversing and she  s laughing at his displays of humour . marvellous . it would seem she now has to go and meet her friends , however.she will add him on a social media platform . result . newline newline the girl exits newline the fresher returns back to his group triumphantly newline newline narrator : yes he left the pack a fresher and now he can stride back as a man . newlinewhen i was six my grandfather died . i do nt really recall him being alive any more , although i am told that he looked after me many times in my first few years . my only memory of him is from his funeral , the day i discovered my power . newline newline he died by falling from the roof , trying to fix the tv antenna in high winds . grandma apparently had told him he as a damn fool and as it turned out , she was right . he was too stubborn though , too determined that they d watch the price is right and he climbed up on their roof and fiddled with the antenna until a gust lifted him off and left him thirty feet away on the driveway . newline newline my mom was pretty destroyed by his death . my dad was away in the army and his parents were her support . with him gone , a hole in her life opened up and his funeral was hard on her . for me it was just a strange day , with everyone wearing black and cookies on all the tables . newline newline at the funeral home they laid him out in his best suit and i did nt really understand what was going on . my mom carried me over to him to take a look at the open casket and i just stared a the body , not really sure what she wanted me to see . newline newline later , when the adults were talking , i snuck back and pulled up a little stool , so that i could see over the edge of the coffin . his hear had been brushed back and it looked strange , he always wore it over his forehead and i wanted to help him look correct for my grandma . i thought i d help . newline newline i reached out and brushed his hair forward and the next thing i knew , i was being carried upstairs by my mom . she said that i d fallen and must have hit my head , but i did nt feel hurt , i felt ... different . newline newline she took me to my room and i lay down and she sat with me in silence for a while and i turned to her , my mind filled with strange thoughts and i reached out and held her hand .  it s going to be okay kate .  i told her and she looked at me with eyes wide in fear .  i got to see you grow up , i got to see you become the woman you are today and i m proud of you . i love you katiebird .  newline newline my mother dropped my hand and fled the room , running downstairs and returning a moment later with grandma and several of the mourners and for what seemed like an age they spoke to me and asked me questions . i did nt remember saying anything , i did nt know why i had said those things and eventually people decided that it had been my mom s imagination , or possibly a strange thing i had heard my grandfather say once . newline newline mom never forgot though , she knew that her father had not called her katiebird since she was a child . she knew that the voice that had come from me was that of her father and she knew that what i had said had come from him . newline newline time passed and eventually my mother stopped asking me about it and for a time things returned to normal . if things had gone differently in my life then perhaps i would have never known , this would have been a strange and forgotten story , buried in the odd stuff kids say  file . that changed the day i turned eleven . newline newline for my birthday i had asked to have a party and like all kids parties , my parents had hired someone to entertain , so that the parents of the kids could talk and drink , in the kitchen . in 1985 the best entertainment that you could hire for a kids party was a clown and my parents had found one who was able to do all sorts of tricks to entertain the kids . newline newline i recall him making balloon animals and doing magic but then , about halfway through his show , he collapsed , holding his chest and falling down , unmoving . the kids around me screamed and ran , but i felt no fear . newline newline my mother tells me that she came out of the kitchen to find me with my hand on his forehead and when she called me i turned to her and shrugged , saying  sorry lady , i guess no charge for the party , considering the circumstances.  newline newline this time though she was not alone and a dozen or so of the other children  s parents saw and heard me . the words , perhaps , could have been explained , but the voice , that was the voice of a man who had smoked all his life and there was no way for a child to make that voice . newline newline my mother came to me , unafraid and sat with me . looking back i think she knew what to expect and while the other parents hung back , she sat me down and for a few moments we spoke . she told me later it lasted about a minute and in that time i told her about my life and passed on several messages for the loved ones of the clown . newline newline from that point onwards my life changed . newline newline  newline newline  i can hold onto people for about six minutes.  the woman looked close to tears , but i had found it was better to be businesslike and not comfort people .  after that he  ll be gone , for good.  newline newline she nodded and opened her bag and drew out a cheque book , but i held up my hand .  sorry , cash only.  newline newline she looked puzzled for a moment and then let the cheque book drop back into her bag .  how long after can you uh how long until he is no longer  newline newline  about a week before he  s too far gone . after that i can  t reach them anymore.  another lie , along with the six minute one , but i had set some rules to protect myself and it was easier this way . newline newline she nodded sadly .  hepassed three days ago , but i only just heard about your i only just knew  she was having trouble holding herself together and it took her a second to compose herself again .  thank you . could we do this on thursday ?  newline newline  the body will be at your house ?  the local undertakers were not fans of my work . newline newline she nodded and handed me a small card with her address .  i  ll have the cash waiting.  she stood , slightly uncertainly and pushed out through the beaded curtains and back into the minimall . newline newline the front of my shop was set up to be as clich as possible . i  d long since learned that advertising my abilities made me a target . a minimall was perfect , it offered security , low expectations and cheap rent , while offering a location that people were not afraid to visit . often they would be surprised that i was a man , but most had reached me by word of mouth and few doubted my ability to do what i said i could . newline newline after a series of unfortunate events i had been driven from colorado and now , with a slight life in new hampshire , i was eager to keep myself protected . being seen as a fraud was fine , it didn  t hurt business anyway . the fees i charged were enough to keep my extremely comfortable . todays would buy me a new car and she was far from the only job i had on . newline newline i closed up early , picked up a coffee from the small shop next door and wandered from the minimall . it was sunny outside and i had plenty of time to get across town for my evening job and so i took my time and glanced in the windows as i passed . newline newline i had become accustomed to the occasional person who was out to call me a fraud . they assumed i was preying on the desperate and would hunt me down and confront me . they seemed to feel i would agree to be tested , to be challenged , but i demurred , letting the think what they wanted and offering no evidence to them . newline newline a few had tried to trick me , booking my services , but none had been smart enough to use their own loved one and so i was able to tell at once and then feign difficulty getting a reading , or making things up . they seemed to happy when they caught me , often publishing little diatribes against me online , but it didn  t stop my business and most got bored eventually after  outing  me . newline newline by the reflection in the windows , there were three today , unusual as they normally worked alone . they were better than the normal lot , they switched off , passing me several times and plausibly pausing or going into shops . perhaps they  d have fooled anyone else , but i knew how to spot and how to lose a tail and so i let them follow me for a while . newline newline here in the mall i would be safe , but outside they might try to do something stupid . outside , i might have to d something stupid and so it was better to simply give them the slip . the hallway led to a bathroom and then some emergency stairs , but they led down to the other side of the building . i walked confidently along and slipped into the bathroom , knowing they would need to check both the toilets and also the stairs to see which way i had gone . newline newline the windows were easy to pop from the frames and then push back in on the other side and a large pipe was quick and easy to shinny down . the locked bathroom door would confuse them for a while , but it was better to be gone before they figured it out . newline newline i parked in the middle of the parking lot , normally a tactic to keep safe , but today , with people following me a possible liability . still , getting back to my baby was always a pleasure . she was my only real luxury , a  71 ford torino gt , restored myself and in perfect order . forest green with yellow trim , she was conspicuous , but worth it . newline newline she started without a problem and her deep rumble was impatient and ready , but something was nagging at me . three of them was a lot , too many to realistically be a pi , more than you  d send to try to keep an eye on me . i flicked the engine off again and stepped out , keeping low and scanning the lot . nothing . newline newline i dropped to the ground and quickly scanned underneath my girl , still nothing , but something drove me on and i rolled under to look more closely . there , tucked up so it would be almost impossible to see , a small box  a tracker . i pulled it loose very gently and then extremely slowly rolled out again and stuck it under the minivan next to me . whoever they were , this was professional , beyond what had happened before and it had me worried . someone wanted to keep a very close eye on me . newline newline  newline just stop it , all of you  i screamed like this was the last time i would ever get to speak . newline newline and the world listened for once . for once in my life , somebody listened . well , no , not somebody . everybody listened to me . for the first time in forever , the world listened to what i had to say . newline newline and of course , with my luck , they choose to listen at the worst time . newline newline i did a little spin in the middle of the room . the great wealth of emotions that i had just possessed had left me suddenly , and now there was nothing as the world was silent around me . newline newline i might ve trembled a little as the realization begin to filter in , that the world had given me what i asked . everybody had stopped , all of them . well , everything had stopped . there was no movement , no nothing . i looked at the my coworkers in the room , and all of them were looking at me but not moving . i stepped to the side , and nothing changed but me . i walked out the door , and nothing changed but me . the cars were frozen in place along the street , like some kind of crazy modern art project . newline newline i pulled out my phone , and tried to call my mother . the phone ringed , and ringed , and ringed . and then went to voicemail . and i shut it off . newline newline you know , for most of my life i never really cared about being able to talk to people . i was almost always content with being alone , but walking down these streets full of people but not life , i realized that it was lonely being , um , alone . i know that sounds stupid as hell , thanks captain obvious , but really , that s what i thought as i walked down those roads , full of people who were nt really people at all . nothing but statues . newline newline it occurred to me that for most of my life i had been sort of like this . i guess everybody would sometimes see me walking down sidewalk but nobody ever heard my voice , and to most people i was nothing but a statue . newline newline yeah sure , sometimes i would make an impact on lives , but for the most part i was afraid to get to know people , because i was always afraid of them leaving . i was always afraid of them moving on , because i was afraid of being hurt . because of this , while all those i had known moved on to bigger places , i had been trapped in the same place for years , as others moved forward and found love and had families and friends and did things . newline newline i paused for a minute , on the corner of 47th and 76th , and watched the world as nothing ever changed . newline newline then i crossed to the other side , and looked back at where i had come from , and saw myself , standing like a statue on the other side of the road , as the world went by around her . newline newline and when i turned around again , it was like nothing ever changed , even though everything had .it s nice to be out of that damn hospital ,  brandon thought as he strolled casually down the street . brandon s knew heart seemed to be working just fine . as he walked towards a starbucks he grabbed a newspaper from small table set up outside a restaurant and promptly began to fold it . entering the starbucks he got in line . the man in front of him looked like a college student , judging by the laptop and back pack . but hell , it was starbucks , seemed like everyone needing to type something set up in a starbucks . newline newline brandon s gaze moved downwards to the man s back pocket where he could see the bulge of a small , square billfold . perfect .  brandon folded his newspaper a few more times and eyed the billfold again . needs to be a bit wider .  a few quick adjustments and the folded newspaper looked to be about the same size as the man s wallet . after a quick look around to make sure nobody was watching brandon reached out and dug into the man s pocket very gently and grasped his wallet . then , he seamlessly drew the billfold out whilst replacing it with the newspaper . brandon withdrew and quickly stuffed the wallet into his jacket while the man reached back and felt his back pocket . reassured by the feel of the newspaper , the man stepped forward in line , confident his wallet was still in place . newline newline brandon smiled at his new prize . without a word he turned and left the line after pretending to check his watch . upon opening the wallet brandon found that the man was indeed a college student , judging by the campus id card . only  23 in cash ... not much but it was easy money , and brandon knew he could easily repeat the stunt as many times as was needed to buy a decent amount of groceries for the week . newline newline after raiding the billfold of all its resources brandon approached a trash bin tossed the empty leather pouch into the opening . it was at this moment , that brandon stopped ... he stared at the trash bin for a very long time , unsure of the feeling that he was experiencing . he felt very wrong , very sick ... like he had done something terrible . he thought of the man at starbucks who was probably just now reaching for his wallet to only find a folded newspaper , but his thoughts did nt stop there . in a matter of seconds the memories of every foul deed brandon had committed swept into his mind . the color drained from his face as he realized the pain and grief he had caused so many people . then , right there in the middle of the crowded walk way , brandon broke down . as he sobbed people passed him without breaking stride , some looking confused , others disgusted and some with a look of concern . newline newline after about five minutes of pathetic whimpering , brandon came to his senses . he rose to his feet and dashed over to the trashcan and buried his hand into the filth it contained . feeling around for a while , brandon finally found the man s wallet and he quickly placed the  23 back inside . his past offenses were too late to fix , so he could at least mend this one . newline newline as he ran back to the starbucks he began to worry if he would even find the man who he had stolen from . as the starbucks came into view a sense of relief washed over him as he sighted the man walking away from him . he caught up to him , gasping for air .  sir ! sir , i have your wallet .  the man turned around and locked eyes with brandon . newline newline  you mean you stole my wallet .  said the man as he reached for it , rather angrily . newline  yyes , i did and i m sorry . i promise i put everything back though .  as brandon gave the wallet back , he could nt help but smile . it felt good to do this . newline  thanks for giving it back , man . just , do nt be an asshole eh ?  and with that , he left . newline newline as brandon walked away the good feeling went away and was quickly replaced by the dread he had felt before . how could he make up for all of the things he had done ? all the people he had mistreated ? he walked , lost in thought for a long time until something told him to stop . he could nt tell what had made him stop  a feeling he had perhaps . brandon looked up and saw that he was standing in front of a small church . he had never been one to believe in or really care for god , nor had he ever stepped foot in a church , but something felt different now . brandon took a tentative step forward , then another . after a few steps he quickened his pace . maybe the answer to helping others is in here . when their ships came from the west , there was no telling what they were capable of . from their wooden platforms , they flung stones and fired arrows onto our islands , trying to weaken us , but we did not fall . when they found their way on land , they sent their armies , they constructed towers of loose material to climb our walls , and they even used magic powder that exploded on contact with fire , but our walls did not fall . day after day , night after night , we repelled their attacks , until both armies were exhausted . when the enemy was on the precipice between victory and defeat , they retreated to their ships and called on forces unlike any we had seen before . from the west , four giant men trudged across the vast blue waters and approached our island . newline newline we used the enemies wooden machines to hurl stones and fired arrows at these beings , but they did not relent . we constructed shoddy towers and charged with swords in hand , but they did not falter . we exhausted ourselves , throwing lives away in an attempt to find some way to make these beings relent . afraid , we called on our own forces , beings we thought to be equally powerful . newline newline our people first prayed to the winds , to bring storms and rattle our enemies with lightning . a man came down from the heavens and stood on our walls . he used his sword to direct the skies , and conducted a great typhoon . our enemies faltered , but only for a moment . they approached the island , their sights set on the land that held it . newline newline next we prayed to the oceans , bidding them to bring waves to crash into these foes . a dragon rose from the seas and curled around the eastern tower on the island . from there , with a sharp gaze , he and the many creatures of the sea called waves so large , they rushed over the island , and broke on the legs of the four foes . under the harsh wind and brutal waves , our foes slowed , but did not stop . they circled the island , and began to reach for the earth surrounding it . newline newline we then prayed on the storms above , calling for lightning to descend and strike the mountainous beings . in a bolt of lightning , an ancient man clothed in white stood at the very top of the northern guard tower wielding a staff . he rose his staff to the sky and commanded the thunder and lightning from the clouds above . like a sword , the man used the streaks of white lightning as his weapon to strike the heads and bodies of the four beings . the beings flinched , and cried out in pain , would not cease . with their hands dug deep into the earth of the island , they took told and drew the island high into the sky . newline newline in desperation , we now call on one final deity . the very one who commands those souls that have departed . we now pray on the woman who resides in the shadowy land of the dead . we pray to her to reap the souls of these creatures , and we pray that she will spare our own . if she is not merciful , these words scribed on the walls of our stronghold shall be our last . we beg of the next people to inherit these lands . never forget the power of the gods .less than thirty years , maybe forty with a pacemaker installed at fifteen years , and only if you starve yourself , only if you do nothing worth living for , nothing to elevate your goddamn rate ... newline newline the tick , tick of the sandman has focused all of our minds . newline newline every bloody , unnatural , sickening loophole has been tried . but the only escape is to transcend death and now we are so very close . newline newline i can see my body , the bio clock implanted in my arm , counting up ever so slowly . my sense of time here is fast . everything in the real world is soothingly slow , especially the clock i am watching , the same clock that i have been watching for twenty years with dread . i ca nt take my eyes off of it . newline newline 999,999,999 . newline newline just one to go . here that seems like thirty seconds . i look into my green eyes , specks of brown . they will cloud over soon . the old me has been unconscious for a few hundred ticks . newline newline i am a disembodied consciousness . this feels real . my new body in the  real  world is a glorified industrial robot . i can move and look at things , speak with people , although that is painfully slow . in here i have a virtual body , and i live in a virtual world , but i am alone . newline newline my job now is to convince them that i am here , so that more will come . i wish that i had a decent real world body . newline newline i slow my sense of time down , so that i can communicate with them . newline newline i watch my old eyes cloud over , in real time now . with my metal hand i gently touch the eyelids and move them over the dead eyes . newline newline they all look at me . i see joy , hope and fear . newline newline  i am here now ,  i tell them .  this body is a fixer upper , but i m in here .  newline newline i watch the fear evaporate , but i feel oddly detached . i want to tell them that i m lonely in here , but that might bring the fear back , after all , coming to this place means dying in the real world . newline newline my voice is quite good , and i spent the next hour answering questions . this would go on for a long time but i tell them that i am tired . newline newline only invica remains . she touches my hand .  i wish that i could feel that .  i say . newline newline she starts to cry .  how do we make you a better body ?  she says . newline newline  i do nt think that is possible sweetie ,  i have a really nice virtual body in here .  when your time comes we will be together here .  newline newline  but john ,  she says ,  i did not think that was possible .  newline newline  not only is it possible , it s the only thing that makes sense ,  i say .  people are not ready for this because it means complete detachment from the real world ,  but walking around in one of these tin cans is not living . i need you to help get me into a much bigger computer baby ... please help me ?  newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinei woke up sharply , it feels like my nose is is being stabbed . opening my eyes i see pink and black . then two green eyes open up its my cat letting me know she is out of food . rubbing the sleep out of my eyes i slowly creak out of bed as my back pops and complains . once there is food in her bowl again she promptly jumps up on the bed to steal the warmth from my pillow . newline newline gently sitting down on the icey cold toilet my body starts to wake up in more ways then one . my gut grumbles as i know i  m about to regret that hot sauce i had last night . after a lifetime of pain i turn on the shower as no amount of wiping will make me feel clean after that ordeal . as i stand there waiting for the water to warm up . newline newline  hey dick weed !  someone shouts behind me . newline newline jumping a foot in the air my heart pounding out of my chest . my bathroom is about 5 foot by 6 foot there couldn  t be anyone in there but me without me knowing . i spin around . newline newline  what the hell ! you scared the shit of  there is no one just my reflection in the mirror . newline newline  that  s an interesting choice in phrase there . we need to talk about what you just put me through.  said a muffled voice comes again from behind me .  but first for the love of god get in the shower i am wallowing in my own shit right now  newline newline again i turn around but its just my shower . after pinching myself to make sure i  m awake .  ok this isn  t funny who  s messing with me ?  newline newline  no one is messing with you i  m your ass

get out of the shower trying to figure out who is pranking me .  ok i  m awake now who is this ?  nothing . i guess the prank is over .  my naked ass better not be on youtube.  i mumble as i walk into

ok i  ve been talking with the other organs and we decided that if i  m going to talk we each get a turn . so we need to talk about your intake because i get the worse end of it when it comes out.  the muffled voice says coming out from under a very suprised cat . newline newline  ok this isn  t funny anymore who is this ?  i shout as i stand up to the vocal displeasure of suki . newline newline  dick wipe this is your ass talking . get with the program we need to talk and i  m on a tight schedule your back has a meeting with you in 20.  grumbles my ass . newline newline  wait this isn  t a

the obesity these days . every fat person i see is just a little kid who was forbidden to run . i get out of bed , put on my shorts and a tshirt and get out of the house . it s a clear night without

sleeper s ear . sitting up abruptly , eyes blinking to get used to the dim lighting from the hallway . floorboards creaked from downstairs , though no one else was supposed to be there . heart pounding in chest , there was no use to pick up the phone . those had been dead long before the power had stopped . the crank radio picked up only static for the last three days . food was running low . the creaking of the floor boards stopped . two feet took their place beside the bed as the sleeper rose . walking as if on glass , their hands wrapping around the door frame , eyes transfixed down the stairs . the front screen door slapped several times . was it safe ? was it gone ? or was another there now ?some bystanders thought they were heroic , yet chosen to deny their ensuing pretentiousness . it was involuntary : the collective decisions that lead to the need to save what society would deem a fallen angel . a select few still felt a need to be a hero , rise above the other filth in the sty . maybe life had some sort of sentimental value to those people , or maybe , charity was just a great egoboost . it did nt matter in the end , though . the unsure appeals to hope and shoutouts to christ , after the realization that they d just fall on deaf ears , stopped . the misguided attempts would start up again , only to be drowned out by the random snippets of conversation by other passerby . newline  jesus ! just fucking jump already if you  re not going to listen ?  screamed an increasingly annoyed man , who was just trying to share his own shouty version of the gospel a few minutes ago . newline this sentiment was repeated , recited in the faces the gathering crowd . newline as more and more time lapsed , the man s leather jacket became his only friend . the only thing protecting him from the howling wind that threatened his composure . newline  ah em .  clearing his voice : a strict juxtaposition to the uneasy silence . newline he averted his eyes upwards towards a cloudy , gray skyyet somehow they still delighting in the nonexistent rays which burnt images and geometric patterns into his retinas . newline  he said to them : go !  newline bottles of blueberry vodkas and iphones : were dropped for the first time . the whole herd rushed down the towards the water . each , making a point of not getting too close to the man . the water soon became red , and he laughed as he walked back onto the bridge . newline once the job was done , he trudged along the middle of the road , knowing that no vehicle could hurt him . the man would slow his pace occasionally to scoff at the survivors , whose were maimed bodies wrapped around railings indicated an obviously desperate attempt to subvert the  mind control .  newline  please ... please ...  it trailed off , then rebounded ...  please ...  newline the words were cut off , but he was sure the end was :  kill me .  newline that cry resounded from every direction , inevitably dying out after some time . it was nt always the same voice , or the same wordsbut the sentiment that constantly lead to troughinspired scuffles , resonated with each scream newline the bystanders knew they were a witness to somethingsomething they had always feared . newline he finally made it to the end of the bridge , leading into a mountainside tunnel , and could nt help but smirk when he saw the graffiti : newline newline new world order . newline newline it has begun newline newlineit was a slow day waiting for fishes to bite , for some reason . maybe it s because of the grey sky above , but that s just pushing it . i opened up another can of beer to pass the time , my fourth one in an hour , thinking to call it a day , and just head home and rest . newline newline that was when i heard the screeching of tires , followed by a loud crash . dropping everything , i instinctively rushed towards the sound of the crash , hoping to help where i can . my hand was already pulling my phone out , when another sound convinced me to hide myself . it was the unmistakable rumble of a armoured troop transport . but what were they doing out here ? newline newline from where i stood i could see the crash site clearly . smoke was slowly rising from the chevrolet , but the car did nt look too damaged . only the front part was crumpled . a guy climbed out from the passenger seat . he looked barely past 25 . his hand was holding his head as he frantically rushed towards the passenger door , trying to drag his unconscious friend out . newline newline i wanted to help , but the sight of the approaching apc convinced me to not . the apc stopped not far from the crashed chevrolet , and two men in military fatigues stepped out , a rifle slung across each of their shoulder . the insignia on their uniform was more than enough to strike fear across anyone . the president s own truth corps  . newline newline the chevrolet driver seemed to know this , as panic was clearly written all over his face .  please , please , i really did nt mean it . i deleted the it as soon as it was posted , it was a joke !  he tried to plead with one of the army guys , kneeling on the asphalt road . newline newline  you know the president does nt take lightly to insults on twitter ,  one of the officer responded curtly . before the chevrolet driver could even respond , a bullet struck his head , and he fell to the ground . the truth corps  officers then moved to the passenger side of the car , intending to do just the same with the passenger . newline newline this time , however , i already had my handgun out . they never had a chance to react as i quickly fired two rounds aimed at their head . their bodies fell right next to the chevrolet s driver . i continued to stay where i was , gun aimed at the apc , waiting to see if there were anymore truth corps soldiers . newline newline after for about ten minutes , without any further movement from the apc , my hand reached for the walkietalkie behind my back , as i slowly made my way unto the road .  lookout 3 to nest . lookout 3 to nest . i m afraid i ve got some kind of situation here , over .  newline newline        newline newline rdoritalespeople said i always had a flair for showmanship . i knew how to lay out a stage and dazzle everyone . what they do nt know is my dad pissed off some gypsy and cursed me to drain all the luck from others around me . it s sounds terrible at first but i only drain luck when i purposely try to do something . and my dad says it ends up worse for people who try to use my talent for themselves . as i grew older i got offered a job because this guy found out about my gift  . i assume he knows the gypsy somehow . they pay is great but i feel so weird looking at how everything is panning out . i guess we are gon na have to wait and see how far mr. trump and i are gon na get in this campaignand the mission is over , scott has gathered all the information he needed from his reckon mission of palo alto , california of the year 1921 . newline newline he turns on his time transporter . it is time to go back home and rest . newline newline scott gets home . everything seems normal , except that all smart phones are slightly bent . he does nt know what happened . why are all smartphones slightly bent and not completely flat , like when he left ? newline newline he reach to his pants , and he ca nt find his phone . it dawns on him . he left his iphone 6 in 1921 , and now , all smartphones bent alittle .man had struggled to breathe , gasping what oxygen it could from a cloud of thick dark smog . pipelines shattered across every continent painting layers of the land with the reality of suffocation and fire . those communities , that had avoided the dangers of the atmosphere and the deep earth , found themselves cleansed of life by miles of oxygen deprived ocean that had migrated south from the poles in the time it took to take one last breath . the flora had faltered and the fauna had fallen on this beautiful floating buoy . newline newline a boy and his father stood in one of the last oasis left on the face of the earth . the boy turned to his father and pleaded :  please . father , can we do something for them all ?  newline newline  its no use watering dead flowers  the father replied . newline newlinehis hands curled around the grip of his shotgun . the machine had launched many slugs into great men . he charged forth , his helmet occasionally dipping into his line of sight . he decided to dodge behind a building , due to an attack . grenades zipped past his face , with bullets peppering the opposite wall . his rocket launcher was beckoning to him , wanting to be fired at the opposing force . the launcher was grabbed and shot the explosive round . newline newline the rocket hit the ground , sending shockwaves and shrapnel towards the other side , knocking them back . they all perished .  newline newline he finally got to his destination : a suitcase of intelligence . he grabbed it and ran with all of his might , with his legs hammering like great pistons . the rocket launcher was restricting his movement . newline newline after a long , uphill fight  and a shot to the left arm  , he made it to base .  newline newline red won the point !  newline newline  yes , that was based off of team fortress 2 . it was a soldier capturing the intelligence of blue . jane had drifted away from her husband in his last days . she rarely spoke to him , and when she did , it was to yell at him for something he forgot to do . when they found out about her husbands condition , they were both optimistic that he would recover . sadly , this lead to jane treating her husband the same way as before .  why do you get special treatment ? youe just going to get better anyways , and then we re going to be behind on our work .  jane regretted those words at the time of her husbands death . newline newline it was early in the morning , when jane received a phone call to inform her that her husband was in the hospital and he was in his last moments . as jane raced to the hospital , her mind began to fill to the brim with questions .  why was he up so early ? what was he doing out of the house ? how did he get to the hospital ?  she eventually arrived to the hospital , but it was too late . death had beaten her to her husband . as she sat there , motionless , the doctor approached her .  maam , we were able to save your husbands memories , would you like to start the transfer now ?  jane could nt stand to see herself through her husbands eyes . she would feel the sting of every word she had ever said , every teardrop that ran down her husbands face , and worst of all , every bit of hate and resentment she knew her husband held against her . newline newline the years went by as jane held the flash drive containing her husbands memories every single morning . she had lived her life alone  isolating herself from others for fear that she would unleash her hate unto them . finally , on her deathbed , the doctor was present when she pulled the flash drive out of her pocket .  do it doc , i must know the truth .  the doctor transferred the memories as jane went on her final ride . newline newline she lived her husbands childhood , when they first met , their marriage , and she eventually approached the day of her husbands death . he had awakened before the sun had even risen , with a pain in his abdomen . he knew his time was near , but he could not awaken his beautiful wife . he kissed her on the cheek , and whispered  i love you , always have , always will . no matter what you say or what you do , i would rather be with you , then be alone . i will be with you , until the end of time . i forgive you .  he eventually drove himself to the hospital , knowing that he had spent his life with woman he loved . newline newline jane had experienced everything in the span of a minute . her heart began to flatline , as she whispered to the doctor ,  he forgave me .  newline newline                              state your full name please .  newline newline samantha lynn anderson . 32 years old . local girl , have nt strayed too far from l.a. since i was born . i already noticed my voice wavering , my eyes darting around a bit too much , my hands gestures faulting and wavering just enough to be picked up on . newline newline the interrogation is going well so far . what most do nt realize is that the police ask you for basic information to give police a baseline on how you react to questioning  appearing as the slightlynervous but still keeping it together woman with a husband and kids will help me walk out of this room a free woman . newline newline  mrs. anderson , what is your relationship with warren oswald ?  newline newline i told the truth . he was a client of mine . typical severe case of avoidant personality disorder and anxiety  the pathetic sack could nt leave his house without his parents encouragement . thirtythree years old and he had no ambitions outside of browsing the internet and his welfare check . the fat fucker should have blown his brains years ago to stop his leeching of society s resources . newline newline  did you ever believe mr. oswald to be suicidal ?  newline newline and here s my shield of doctor patient confidentiality . yes , i would be more than willing to release his patient information to aid your investigation . no , none of my notes ever reflected him being suicidal . no , i m not stupid enough to log our conversations where i hint at his mother secretly molesting him as a child and the only person he remotely trusted has always been abusive . yes , i suggested this while wearing a low cut top and leaning towards him to further open him up to suggestion . newline newline  interesting , according to ...  newline newline i do nt know what she said but her eyes told me she knew . not suspected , she knew . those beautiful blue hawk eyes were narrowing as she grew frustrated , her tone of voice faltering as i evaded all responsibility of my actions . somehow , she s caught me , but ca nt reap the rewards of her hunt . newline newline  ... knew nothing , did you ? nothing whatsoever of his infatuation ? and your office has a history of suicidal patients .  newline newline she had nothing to pin me and she knew it . i kept it simple , stating that it s merely an unfortunate side effect of the work we both know . i almost felt like gloating but i knew that s how people like me get caught . they get cocky . arrogant . they beg to be punished for their sins . and that is a mistake i will never make . after all , i ve got three kids to feed . newline newline i ve been here way too long . i ask if there are any further questions . newline newline she sighs , defeated . newline newline  thank you for your time , mrs. anderson . sorry about keeping you from your boys so long .  newline newline she despises me , yet i sympathize with her . it s frustrating , not being able to land a kill , to return from a hunt empty handed . especially for someone as formidable as her . newline newline i enjoyed my cat and mouse games , but i had to get back home . keep up appearances with my husband and all that . my husband kisses me on the cheek as i walk in , yet i m still pissed at him for what he did with that cunt jessica down the street . newline newline some days i just feel like killing him . i know back when you were kids it probably looked like a fantasy . i mean , the world treated my kind like rock stars or war heroes . our faces were on cereal boxes , saturday morning cartoons , little action figures . we made more money from advertising deals than we ever did actually working . at the time i thought we deserved it too , it s a hard job . not hard like breaking your back under a hot sun all day  not hard like being away from home for months on end , not knowing when you ll make it back . it was hard like a big game hunt . the tiger never tires , the risk never dies , and the predator has far more to lose than the prey . no one saw that from the outside , they only saw a golden age . newline newline but they were nt golden days to anyone living in them . yeah , i knew our luck was about to end after my last mission with a team , in 86 . i was already a professional , you need only have two on your record to be considered one but i had six . on my team of ten , only five casualties my entire run . none while i was in charge . until that time . newline newline we were dispatched to a place called talcott , west virginia . there they built a mile long train tunnel , the same one john henry was rumored to have died working in , and it had been a popular spot for disappearing teens . there were nt any confirmations , but back then it was better to be safe than sorry , so the suits sent us anyways . newline newline so with a team of ten : you have two on point leading . because they re the real risk takers , you put two on duty to watch their ass . you have three to man the portable equipment and three to kill the damn thing . newline newline we were walking into a trap . you ever see a ghost before ? they do nt hide under sheets , they do nt rattle chains and moan in agony . you can barely notice them at all . especially in the stark black of the big bend tunnel . you have to feel them . at best it s the chill in your spine or the movement out of earshot . at worst you see the memories of the old world , the shadows of what was or wanted to be . your soul wants to escape it all so much your skin curls and your blood boils . there s no time to hesitate , lest your very being be devoured by the specter s hunger . newline newline we were always ready for casualties , but not like this . the point men die first , they always do , then the guard . by the time i realize what s going on i light my torch and went to protect what team i had left . it was too late , one partner with the other plasma torch goes out with a snap . the other lights a flare , holding it in one hand and a cross in the other . one of the engineers in the back gets on his knees and begs , he heard once that in worst cases you may survive through the grace of the ghost s mercy . it did nt work for him . newline newline soon all that was left were the two killers , myself and my mate philip , with barely enough equipment to hold the thing down , much less kill it . philip always had faith in christ , and part of me believed in that faith too . always served him well . yet in the darkness of that pit , christ was nowhere to be found . it killed him . newline newline so i take the flare from philip and i take the plasma torch and before it reaches me i kill the damn thing . i never got a good look at it , even with the blinding lights in my hands , but i felt the cold whisper of death on its breath , on its fingertips . i rested for half a moment before i realized i had to lug all the equipment back myself and write condolence letters to nine families . newline newline i walk back a half mile to the exit of the tunnel , longest walk of my damn life . after that i decided to never work with a team again . too many good men can get lost in the darkness . good thinking too , because it was nt too long after the haunting in connecticut made ghost hunting taboo and we became the pariahs i knew we were on the inside . newline newline you know the rest : i moved to seward , became a private hunter , and lived on whatever i could . demand died down , but it never died off . it s why i m still living , it s why we are down here now hunting this thing . you asked me if i believe in god after all i ve done , sure i do . you deal with the afterlife so long you realize death is inevitable . what made me stop going to church was what happened to philip . now i know why : our job s not really honorable . not in the eyes of the lord . if all these lost souls are looking for god s divine guidance back home , then we are the devils they fear , preventing them from salvation . how could god ever forgive that ultimate sin ? that was philip s downfall , thinking your soul could be saved even if you survived . that anyone could be forgiven for that . i knew after that day i d never make that mistake . i shudder to imagine what awaits me in death , but i do know that i will deserve it . i looked into her eyes , twin mirrors that caught the evening sunlight and made them twinkle . she was the love of my life . when i though she wasn  t looking , i glanced at the numbers on her forehead . newline newline  aiden ! stop it . you  ve been acting strange all day !  newline  i can  t help it . your eyes are amazing  newline  don  t lie to me ! you know when . when i  m gon na  you know  newline i caressed her hair and comforted her ,  babe . i . i.  newline  i don  t wan na know ! i  ve you ever loved me , you won  t tell me ! babe , let  s just enjoy our day together and forget all about this  newline  can you tell me mine though ?  i looked at her hopefully . newline  no ! ! ! we weren  t meant to know these kind of things  newline newline how could i not say anything ? anita was going to die today and all she wanted to do was stay here and have our stupid picnic . the girl of my dreams would take her last breath today . i held back a sob . i glanced at the death sentence on her beautiful forehead , holding back a whimper . newline her expression was pained . she looked at me with deep sadness . newline newline  she knows . she knows it  s today  i thought to myself . newline newline we had a perfect meal together . i actually calmed down and enjoyed her company . anita grabbed my hand and pulled me behind the old shed . we made out and had some fun . newline after we finished , i thought to myself  this is the last time we  ll ever be together  . newline i kept myself in one piece though to please her , glancing at those digits gracing her perfect head.it was finally time to go home . it had gotten late and i thought that maybe just maybe anita had escaped the sequence . she would live and we would have each other for a while more.we got into my old corolla and i drove us home to our apartment . steering wheel in one hand and anita  s hand in my other , we felt the breeze of springtime on our faces . newline newline  this is nice . we had a nice day , did nt we ?  newline  we had the best day  i said choking back tears because her tone was nostalgic , almost nonchalant . newline newline as i crossed the intersection , she looked at me and i returned her gaze sadly . in that moment , i saw it . a large gasoline truck that had apparently lost control came right at us at full speed . there was no way i could avoid it . they say that in the last few moments of your life , your entire existence flashes before your eyes . that  s not true . your brain goes into overdrive and works faster than ever though . it was in that moment that i realized that anita had somehow figured out that we were both destined or programmed to die today . she  d made sure that our last day was spent together . i realized that anita had made the best of our last day . instead of doing crazy stunts like most others did on their last day , she had the wisdom to spend her last day and mine with me . i wanted to kiss her , but i knew i had precious few seconds left . newline newline  i love you !  newline  not as much as i do !  newline newline i squeezed her hand . darkness . newlineronek edged closer and closer towards the scared child cowering in the corner of the shipping crate , curious to see who else was occupying the somewhat dark and claustrophobic space . each move of ronek s tyres caused a series of creaks and groans in the crate s metallic structure . although ronek featured a highly sophisticated onboard ai system , higher density alloys and advanced tactical thinking , nothing could change its pontiac firebird exterior . an automated car moving on its own accord in a closed space was terrifying , especially for such a small child . newline newline flufften promptly jumped inbetween ronek and the child hoping to stop ronek from moving any closer . her once bushy fur coat was now slightly damp with a combination of sea water , oil and battery fluids . unlike ronek , her creator chose a more human friendly shell . the body of a 10 year old black german shepherd with faint tan markings . her ai system was more forgiving towards humans , she factored in emotion and fear significantly better than her counterpart . aware of her failings ronek turned on her xenon headlights to allow flufften to conduct more thorough research of the human specimen . sujeeta ren aged 8 . flufften struggled to understand what a human was doing here . ronek continued to envy any suspected ai system that didnt have a car exterior like she did . newlinehe watched as it happened two at once , not a rare occurrence , but it usually did not happen in this fashion . he watched as the older man stabbed the little boy in the chest and tossed him over the railing . the little boy in his pained panic caught the man as he was tossed throwing him off balance and taking both of them off the bridge onto the stone ground below . newline he rose from the shadow on a building close by and walked towards the two both of which were just sitting up while their dead bodies didn  t even twitch . the figure taps his scythe on the ground once to catch their attention . newline focusing on the little boy he says in his kindest voice , which is still deep and gravelly  i have come to escort you home , you will be given another chance to experience life again.  then tilting his head he looks at the other soul , the man who brought about the events of today and said in his normal deathly voice ,  and you will also be given another chance at life after you  ve paid for your sins.  newline the spirit of the man stood up and goes to kick the kid as he says ,  yeah and what makes you think that you can make me pay ?  newline the figure spins and twists its scythe so the blade blocks the older spirits  ethereal foot from hitting the younger spirit . ignoring the older spirit who has had his leg caught by touching the scythe the figure slightly kneels down ,  we shall drop you off first to the rest station where you will wait for rebirth then you won  t have to worry as your next chance will come soon.  newline his dark hood twisted back towards the man on his scythe as he lifts it up holding the spirit that ends up flailing as he is held upside down by death ,  you will get to see what can never be yours on this cycle , until your rebirth you will be paying for your crimes.  then the figure reached out his skeletal hand to the young boy , who took it , and they started walking with him back towards the building and the three of them vanished into the darkness , two willing and one against his will . newlinethree , we were three . we walk under forest with point stick . i hunger . we knew rain would bring life . we look for forest beast with branch on head . blackness almost come . the dark grows . newline newline we found cliffs , valley , i look out into valley and my own tribe made i fall down slope ! i hurt , oh aum

, and reach out to silence it , fingers fumbling about for the snooze . newline newline it  s another day , i whisper quietly to myself , as i stare at the red digits on the alarm clock . newline

avoid bumping into anyone . it was a long walk to the jail house . her toes , not covered by her worn sandals , fingers , and nose , were freezing from the winter wind . shivers ran through her body . she fixed her scarf so that she would retain as much as possible , and tried to walk with more haste . newline newline it wasn  t much faster than her original speed . newline newline she felt her life force draining out of her as she walked up the stone steps . the familiar thoughts of death ran through her mind as she opened the formidable door .   i  m hereto visitmy son.   she said ,

newline   son !   she cried .   why did you do something so foolish ! sostupid !   newline newline he sighed . it was always like this . yet , something in his heart always stung when he saw his

okay , mom . i promise i  ll make it out of here and live life without any regret . pinky promise.   the childlike gesture ended with a kiss on her now warm hand : the symbol of promise , and

entertainment and cleaning supplies  allowed the corporation to drive its competitors into the jaws of the mindless creatures lurking outside their walls . the ceo , having completely abandoned sam

his calls .it was a book about living on an island , washing in the sea , fishing among sharp coral , and eating humans to survive when there was no other option . i knew of the book before it was assigned in english class for us to read . there were some survival parts , and there were other parts  near the climax  with cannibalism . we were studying the novel indepth , so the teacher was devoting an entire day to replicating an environment with cannibalism . we might then face the moral questions it brought to civilized man . newline newline  cannibal day  was a legend of my high school , only available to 10th year english students . it was the strangest tradition of the school , criticized by parents . mr. deveraux waved them off , mocking their illiteracy and encouraging students to educate their parents about the author of the novel , named george harris wills . the teacher told them to start with the utterly true fact that wills was not a cannibal , and his fiction was the most creative of american novels in the 20th century . newline newline i had nt read any of castaway at all when  cannibal day  came around . i barely even participated , dressing in the bare minimum of costumes to get a grade  i loaded ziploc bags with raw bacon and strapped them to my shirt  . i enjoyed the festivities , including a booth with actually cooked bacon the teacher brought for us to eat while discussing the novel s finer points . i went straight for it . newline newline  what do you think of human meat s similarity to pig meat , mr . grant ?  the teacher asked me a question about a book i knew nothing about at the bacon stand .  newline newline  i believe , well i believe its similarity to bacon is overrated and human flesh is really beyond compare .  newline newline the teacher , in greasy apron , continued to deliver my bacon . although , i m not sure anyone was prepared for my answer . newline newline  not to mention , preparing human meat is different . you have to grease the flesh with extra oil , butter , or fat .  there was a quiet chuckle from the teacher , who was fighting the slow creep of disgust .  but i would nt know anything about that . i ve never been a cannibal .  newline newline i crunched the bacon between the pearls of my gullet and smiled knowingly . newline newline newline newlinejune 12th , 2065 . cincinnati , ohio . been

great military leader or strategist . he was a massive man child with daddy issues and and a mess of nuclear silos at his command . we made the mistake of letting those ass hats rogan and franco make

before another missile took its bite of the big apple . no one is quite sure where the third one came from . north korea had been glassed and wiped from the face of the planet less than twenty four hours after the purge of the west . many suspected that putin had been involved before he caught a bullet in the head from one of his own secret service . i suppose we ll never know or sure . newline newline people around here are the unlucky ones . the ones who did nt make the refugee boats bound for the eu or australia . bandits are everywhere . they ll blow your brains out for a half decent

upon a jellyfish . but would the ape envy the jellyfish ? the savage before me is fat with the fruits of his labors . this is his world , and the primitive thrives where i struggle . he speaks to me with talk of his entertainment , the delusions that obsess him between his own spate of torment , the feverdream savages who bend to his will and carry out his orders . i nod my head , i smile to show

stonework reaching hopelessly towards a sky that all but their bravest will take a century to touch . but among the stone , i see fire ... and it inspires me to press on . reminds me , i was sent here to be extinguished ... and every day i live is another day my people s sentence is thwarted . so i ignore the scent of burnt tar and trash that fills this village and continue my work . i may not have hope , but i have spite , and that is all i need . newline newline time passes , and soon the apes around me begin to shamble in a way i ve grown familiar with . wordlessly i draw my fingers back and rise to join them  what respite these primitives offer , i can not afford to dismiss . i follow them outside to look upon a sky the sun is already fleeing . as i walk towards what is now my home , i think to myself of a future robbed from me ... a world of skyhewn palaces , of automaton servants , of a world where pressing a button with more than a single finger was cruel madness . and i find myself wondering if i can survive , knowing i will never see that world again . newline newline i draw in a breath . i remember the spite . newline newline they thought they were sentencing a man to

and vibration to accompany it . he had told them that there was a twoleg who was coming with him , and that i was their guardian . newline newline i felt something out of place here . twoleg came swimming through my senses . i turned , swiftly scanning the horizon , looking for there . i spotted them through my own version of the tremorsense of the elephant , feeling their vibrations through the floor . i immediately recognised the two poacher teams as askari and ! xanto , travelers from the african serengeti , who had adapted their hunting techniques for the indian creatures . newline newline i spoke to that part of my mind that contained ezar . can you see them ? be ready to stampede , as though you were running from them . i will take care of these two .  ezar trumeted as though he were alarmed , and started running . well , running like an elephant , which is nt fast , but is very hard to stop . newline newline as ezar did this , i started the long stalk of the leopard , slow and steady . the two hunters stood and took aim . newline newline they did nt see me coming . a throwing blade and a ginshot later , and the two hunters were down  ! xanto with a wound in his

gentleman walked up to my counter asking about the various colors of ties that were on display above the cash register . we chatted for a bit before i managed to convince him to try on some of new suits that had just come in . newline newline  i ve never really been a fan of tight collars , you think you can make this a bit more loose ?  newline newline in retrospect , the man had way of using a mix of tone and rhetoric to get a laugh out of me . i did nt even realize what he was doing until later that day . he managed to make the process of haggling prices rather enjoyable . newline newline  have you ever heard of man named heracles ? he lived a long long time ago .  newline newline sarcastic banter here , fun fact there . i could nt help but feel like i ve know this man for more

this man was something different . newline newline  hold on son , let me try that on .  newline newline i happened to look up from opening a box of shoes when i noticed the maroon ridges that spiraled out of the man s chest . i had never seen anything like it before in my entire life . the spiral scar covered his entire chest and centered around the left side of his chest . the scar tissue became darker and thicker as it traveled away from the center . he noticed my eyes . newline newline  i know what you re thinking . it s alright . when you get to be around my age ... well  newline newline and just like that he talked about age and the journey it encompasses for another twenty minutes while i took his measurements and began wrapping up . he spoke in the most general sense too . not a

quickly removed the cheesy goodness and devoured it . the quicker she was in bed the better . walking into the bathroom she stripped down to her underwear and walked into bed . she slipped into the

moved towards the doorway , making sure to keep his distance from susan . she wasn  t sure if she could trust him , and against her better judgment , she followed him . he stood in the kitchen and

said ,  sue , you have early onset dementia.  newline newline  i what ? no i don  t ,  she hastily replied . looking at the man  s face brought great sadness to her though . the look of desperation and loneliness and his eyes really made her feel bad . what if he wasn  t lying ? she sat down next to him and said ,  please don  t cry  she struggled to remember the man  s name ,  don  t cry  newline newline  jerry ,  he said , with tears now streaming down his face . newline newline  jerry , yes i  suddenly she realized that she did know this man ,  you  re that guy i had english with my

was saying , but she just couldn  t believe him .  ii  m sorry , but ,  she slipped away from his grasp and walked into the bathroom . putting on her clothing she headed towards the front door ,  i just need time to think.  she slipped on her heels and left . newline newline jerry wanted to just let her leave  it was too painful to see the woman he loved reduced to such a sad state . if he let her go then she would probably get picked up and sent to a ward , but he still cared too much to allow that to happen . newline newline quickly throwing on a coat and some pants he followed her out

this is insanity , my work would benefit the world   newline newline  you do nt think you were the first , did you , doctor ,  the head agent observed with a slow shake of his head ,  we ve had these

lead to immediate death . and with the new surveillance technology , we could nt so much as hum , even when we were alone . newline newline and now , after nearly 70 years without so much as a hint of a whistle , i stood in front of what could be the most potent weapon in the universe . the only other person there , the bartender , smiled as i slowly approached the polished black wood . newline newline  would you like to try it out ?  he asked . newline newline i nodded , slowly made my way over to the bench , and sat down . as i lifted the cover , a beautiful sight graced my eyes . the ivory keys called out to my trembling hands , and i slowly placed them down , half expecting the police to barge in at any moment . newline newline harmony . newline newline a beautiful sound graced my ears , and suddenly i was overcome with a feverish desire i had nt felt in years . my fingers set to work , making sweet music with the piano . something deep inside me was suddenly awakened , and i was determined to satisfy the decadesold hunger . my throat began to quiver , and i started to sing along with the smooth piano . newline newline  it s nineoclock on a saturday ... as i lay back on the bunk , i sighed . it was hard , living with these animals . day in , day out , pretending to enjoy their crude jokes , eating the shit food from the cafeteria , picking on the weak and cozying up to the rest . lights had gone out half an hour ago , and i was just lying down , enjoying the darkness . newline newline  hey there , capullo  i jerked upright , swinging around to find the source of the noise . from the edge of the room , a shadow seemed to detach itself , and stroll towards me . as it passed the plexiglass window , the light gave it a way . the shadow was matias , a new kid , could nt be more than twenty . he had arrived about a week ago , and i had thought my work on him was starting to take effect . guess not . newline newline  what the hell are you doing in here ?  i demanded , swinging myself up off the bed . his hand came out of nowhere , and knocked me back down . in my slightly dazed state , all i could think about were his hands . they were so big . how had i never noticed them before ? he grabbed me off the floor , and pushed me back onto the bed . newline newline  you know ,  he began conversationally .  you really got to me at first . i was all up in what you said . doubt , fear , selfhatred , the whole fuckin  lot of it .  his fist smashed into me again , leaving me panicked , unable to see through the mix of tears and sweat streaming down my face .  but then , i heard one of them mexican guards talkin  . you know , because this a cracker prison , they do nt think anyone speak spanish ? ai nt that funny ?  he laughed , and forced my head into the steel bar at the top of the bed . newline newline  anyway . you know what i heard ?  he shoved his face right up against mine .  i heard you one o  them s spec  guys !  he cackles again , dropping me to the floor .  i know , i know , i thought it was a rumour too , but you proved me wrong !  he grabs me off the floor , holding me directly against the wall . i was bawling now , crying like , like , like one of those pigs i got rid of . newline newline  and you know what ?  newline newline  wwwhat ?  i manage to croak out from behind my veil of tears .  some of us do nt break that way .  newline newline newline apologise for the format , reddit is confusing . mr. carter , you are accused of inciting at least a dozen people to commit the crime of suicide . given the mentally unstable state of your victims and your position of power over them , the state will attempt to convince the jury that your actions should be viewed as murder .  newline newline the judge looked up from his papers .  how do you plead ?  newline newline oh thank god . an opening . newline newline  i plead not guilty !  i exclaimed , producing a pained frown .  those poor souls already wanted to kill themselves !  newline newline hold eye contact . slight head tilt . draw eyebrows together and raise to signal empathy . newline newline  as their therapist , all i ever tried to do was help ! hey . newline newline man . where to start ? first off , i m writing this 13 years later . so this is almost double the length of time you ve been around . i ll try not to go too deep , or spoil anything . still , i do have some things i wish i did better . newline newline 1  study . actually work at school . i know you can coast along and do it at the last minute . hell , it s what i did . but do nt . it will pay off later . try picking up a language too , to fluency . i know you hate french , but the effort and the practise would train you to get something worthwhile . newline newline 2  do some fucking exercise . i know , i know . we re naturally skinny and have a great metabolism and can pretty much get away with eating shit . still , it s the same as the above . you need some discipline in your life . plus you ll get some muscles and not be such a dork . newline newline 3  do nt worry about being a dork . sorry , kind of counterproductive to the previous remark . but still , really . do what you love . stick at it . you have so many things you can do if you put your mind to it . do that . get hobbies and skills . keep reading , keep gaming ... but please just pick up something practical . newline newline 4  there will be girls . you will love them to bits . and they will leave you . there are three that will be special . the third one , you do nt let her go . because you took your eye off the ball on that one . do nt . do that one better and the rest is peachy . newline newline 5  you are going to realise shortly that the world is a nasty place run by a bunch of corrupt bastards . do nt let it keep you awake at night . newline newline the more i think about the rest , the more i realise that a lot of my recent stuff is on my mind  that third girl ? less than a month ago . sucks ...  . so i will just add one more thing . travel . see foreign shores . meet people . listen to them . learn another language . take care of your friends . newline newline love yourself .someone will shoot a fireball at some point . they always did . and they had three wizards . three ! the warrior s steel shield and bronze armor also did nt look too inviting ... after no pondering at all , i decided to not participate in this fight . i had seen this too many times done it too many times . this embarrassing little gobling herd was just a small encounter made to help the heroes level up  or simply the work of a lazy dungeon master who had not made up any story or dungeons for his campaign  . newline newline i carefully wiggled my way through the crowd . a fireball , a lightning stroke or a hammer would hit any moment now . my fellow goblin warriors were placed conveniently close to each other so it was most important that i got to the outskirts of the herd . some goblins grunted when i pushed passed them but they were too focused on the heroes to really notice me . newline newline i had almost breached the last row of goblins when a cold hand grabbed my arm . i jerked around and stared into a pair of small , golden glowing eyes . newline newline  where are you going ?  hissed the other goblin . newline newline  somewhere safe  , i replied . something was different about this other one . his eyes did nt seem as dull as the others  . he had an aura of danger and cleverness about him . newline newline  what do you know that i do nt ?  he asked . no question about me deserting or being a coward . he definetly was different . newline newline  listen i know heroes like them . they will kill us in an eyeblink . they will not talk , not plead or show any mercy . they will kill every single one of us . i do nt feel like dying today . do you ?  newline newline he looked at me . searching . searching for a sign . for something that would mark me as a lair . newline newline i pulled my arm free from his grasp .  it s up to you  i sounded angry but i was actually covering my anxiousness . we did nt have much time left .  you can either stay here and die a meaningless death or come with me and live a few more days .  i started walking away from the goblin army . i walked fast and stayed hidden behind barrels and shelves . suddenly i heard footsteps behind me . a quick glance over my shoulder showed me that the other goblin was following me . and not a seond too late . a gigantic fireball came soaring down the sky . hitting right into the center of the herd . wizards ... newline newline newline newline i ll never forgot the time the humans walked among us , it was so long ago but still so close in our collective memories .  newline zutu s deep red eyes gleamed and his whispy smoky figure flickered in the darkness as he went on with the story that we had all heard as young babes . each and every zothorian had heard this tale and although part of the fun was scaring the children , there was good purpose too . we had much to fear from the humans , and the first time we were lucky , really lucky . newline newline  it was a regular moon day , like any other , the great people were in their underground homes and the scientists were working on olden day projects such as the interplanetary system transporter and the light wave energy cannon . there seemed to be nothing to signify just how different this day would truly be . little did we know this day could have destroyed the zothorian race forever  newline newline as zutu went on i drifted off into the real version of events . the version zutu would never say simply because if he did he would end up in morgutary for the next thousand years . the truth was classified , by the great king zudelia , my late father . the truth was the humans were for all intents and purposes , harmless . they used technology we had long surpassed and have physical limitations we do not have . we are the shadow race , we blend in with our surroundings and the human eye would never discern us . the humans were a primitive race who our people had chosen to protect but if they knew the truth ... they might not be so forthcoming . newline newline the truth was that the humans had one advantage over us , and that was their immune system . this was something the zotharians simply never adapted to and a simple influenza virus could kill a fully grown adult in just a few hours . naurally , we had eliminated most forms of life on the moon and thereby believed we had taken care of the problem of bacteria and virus s but then it happened , the loud noises , the lights , and finally the landing . newline newline as the human walked towards us , not even being able to tel that we were merely feet away from him , he said these words newline  this is one small step for man , and one huge leap for mankind  newline newline needless to say that if he had been a step closer to the few zotharians who did not have time to move , they would be dead . you see , a zotharian is only invisible when he stands still , but movement alters the camouflage and the deep red zotharian eyes can be clearly seen . shaking , the zotharian workers who stood near this human prayed to god that their lives would be spared , and by some miracle , the human never came into contact with them . newline newline what followed was a flurry of decrees , curfews , and underground lockdowns until the humans finally left . to this day we tell our children stories of the humans , to instill a deep deep fear of them so that when the humans do return to our side of the moon , they children will be no nowhere near by the time they touch down .as i held my young son close to my chest , i stared at the dead body of the rabid raccoon that had jumped at him moments before . i could feel the rash creeping along my hands and up my arms , dark red rings of irritated skin developing along my legs and back as well . i knew that i only had moments left before the medic arrived to prevent the onset of human rabies.my husband touches my shoulder gently before taking our son from my rash coated arms . as the killer , i am the only one affected and neither my husband nor our son jack has picked up the rash . newline i kick the pistol away and markus picks it up and reholsters it in his belt . newline i will live with this rash for the rest of my life but it was worth it to protect my son from certain death . newline newline first time posting a

bespectacled which in itself is already an unflattering combination of traits  however , to make it worse , marcus is also 15 meaning he has a face full of acne and his voice is cracking . newline newline marcus searches for an empty seat as he lazily strolls down the bus aisle  it  s been a long day and he  s exhausted  newline newline holy shit . jessica  s sitting by herself ! marcus  eyes light up and he scrambles down the aisle . he plops onto the seat which grabs her attention . she  s making a rather displeasing face , but she is still gorgeous . marcus  eyes can  t help but be

has found himself seated next to sarah , also 15 and in his class . her stringy brown hair is sloppily wrapped in a sagging ponytail . her eyes : mud brown , her skin : worse than his . she gives him

newline newline marcus : what the fuck is wrong with you ? ! bad phone ! very bad phone ! why did you play that song in front of jessica ? and that song in front of sarah ? i want jessica . jessicah ! you stupid , stupid , phone . when i save up enough money i  m replacing you with a galaxy note 7 so i never have phone problems again ! newline newline newline next morning , marcus is still in bed , sound asleep  beep beep beep ! marcus  eyes burst open . he sits up on the edge of his bed and turns off his alarm  wait . he brings the phone right up to his myopic eyes : 8:45am . fuck ! newline newline marcus quickly gets dressed and runs out the door  chasing after the last bus to school . newline newline newline marcus gets on the bus all the while mumbling to himself . newline newline marcus :  under his breath  stupid phone , stupid phone , stupid phone ... newline newline he looks up and sees only one other person on the bus : sarah . their eyes meet and she waves to him . darn , guess he  s sitting next to her . he walks over and tiredly plops into the seat . newline newline sarah : hey marcus . newline newline marcus : mornin  newline newline sarah : i  ve never seen you on the late bus before . i  m usually the only one here ... newline newline marcus : yeah , my alarm went off at a later time than usual . newline newline sarah : that  s strange . do you know what  s wrong ? newline newline marcus : yeah , it  s probably mad at me . we had our first fight last night . newline newline sarah giggles at marcus   joke  . he realizes how crazy that sounded . newline newline marcus : so why are you on the late bus ? newline newline sarah : i live very far away . it  s the only bus that comes to my area . newline newline marcus : why don  t you move closer ? newline newline sarah : have you seen the houses around here ? they  re way too expensive . my dad could never afford it . newline newline marcus : do your mom not work ? newline newline sarah : she passed away a few years ago . she used to drive me to school . she  d always take me to the pancake house on mondays for their breakfast special . newline newline marcus : the waffle sticks ? the ones you dip into the syrup ? newline newline sarah : yeah ! newline newline marcus : i love those ! with the blueberry syrup . amazing ! newline newline sarah : we should ... go some time ... together . newline newline marcus : i doubt it . i  m saving up money to buy a new phone . newline newline sarah :  despondently  oh , okay . newline newline at school , during lunch , marcus walks through the halls towards his locker  newline newline he gets grabbed by the shoulders and pinned to the wall by jack , the quarterback for the school  s football team . he  s also 15 but he  s a head taller than marcus and twice his size . newline newline marcus : hhey jack . what  s up  newline newline jack : is this your phone number ? newline newline marcus : whwhat ? newline newline jack : phone number ? is it yours ? newline newline marcus finally notices jack  s phone in his face . he scans the phone number on the screen . newline newline marcus : yeah that  s mine . where did you  newline newline jack : so then you sent me this text ? newline newline marcus : what ? newline newline marcus reads the text message on jack  s phone , sent through marcus  number : newline newline  hey fuck face ! you think you da shit ? you . me . soccer field . after school . i  m gon na beat your faggot ass to death , bro !  newline newline marcus is horrified . newline newline marcus : no , no , no , that  s not ... oh shit . newline newline jack : you  re dead bro ! newline newline jack storms off leaving marcus to slump on the ground . marcus pulls out his phone and glares at it like it  s a dog that just peed on the carpet . marcus clutches his phone and runs to the bathroom . newline newline newline marcus bursts into a stall , locks the door , and holds the phone over the toilet . newline newline marcus : that  s it man ! i  m done with you . you have ruined my life ! i  m gon na smash you into bits , flush you into this toilet , and let the alligators eat you ! you stupid , stupid ,

oh shit . newline newline marcus sits on the toilet seat and lifts up his legs . he hears the conversation . one of the voices sounds familiar . newline newline jessica : i know ! it  s gon na be hilarious ! newline newline girl : jack is going to beat that little dweeb into the ground . newline newline jessica : i hope he scares marcus out of this school forever . he such a little creep .

an ugly little dork . i hope he doesn  t try and ask me out . newline newline girl : maybe jack will knock his teeth out ! newline newline the two girls laugh like mustache twirling villains as they leave the bathroom . marcus  head is on his knees . he wants to cry but he knows he should . that was a real blow to his selfesteem , but it will be worse if anyone catches him in the girl  s washroom . he listens for other people in the bathroom and slowly creeps out of the stall  newline newline sarah walks out of the stall two down from his . they lock eyes  his are wide with fright , hers are blinking with confusion . newline newline sarah : what are you doing in here  marcus : i ran into the wrong  newline newline marcus : sorry , you go ahead . newline newline sarah : no , i think you should talk . newline newline marcus : right ... i ran into the wrong bathroom and ... uh , i thought the coast was clear . newline newline sarah : yeah me too . newline newline marcus :  concerned  you ran into the wrong bathroom ? newline newline sarah : no , no ! i was waiting for jessica to leave . newline newline marcus : really ? newline newline sarah : yeah , she  s pretty mean to me . and i guess to you too ... newline newline marcus : yeah ... newline newline sarah : are you okay ? i heard to yelling in the stall earlier . newline newline marcus : it  s just my stupid phone .  he put it on counter  i was thinking about flushing it into the toilet and just ending it . it  s caused me nothing but trouble  newline newline buzz . the phone vibrates and slips off the counter . instinctually , marcus reaches for it ... but so does sarah . they both catch the phone and their hands connect . they share a moment before sarah lets go and marcus pulls back his phone . newline newline marcus looks at sarah . maybe it was the lighting but she looked beautiful . she let her hair down and it was a light auburn like a warm sunset . her eyes : bronze mirrors reflecting himself , her skin : imperfect but unique . she gave him a warm smile  a genuine smile . marcus suddenly realized he was talking to a girl . newline newline marcus : uh , sorry . iuh ... thanks . newline newline sarah : no problem . newline newline there  s an awkward silence . newline newline sarah : i heard you  re fighting jack  marcus : so , how are you doing  newline newline marcus : sorry , you go first . newline newline sarah : i heard you  re fighting jack . newline newline marcus : yeah ... newline newline sarah : are you gon na be okay ? newline newline marcus : i doubt it . he  s probably gon na kill me . newline newline sarah walks passed him to leave but not before gingerly touching his shoulder . newline newline sarah : well , good luck . don  t get hurt . newline newline

to fight back ? newline newline marcus :  whispering  i got ta do something . sarah  s watching me . newline newline jack : sarah ?  laughs  is that why you sent me that text , bro ? newline newline marcus : huh ? newline newline jack : trying to impress a lady . i can respect that . newline newline marcus : really ? newline newline jack : yeah . i still got ta punch you though . newline newline marcus : oh . newline newline jack raises his fist again  newline newline marcus : wait ! can you take off my glasses first ? newline newline jack : yeah sure , bro . newline newline jack carefully lifts off marcus  glasses and smacks him across the face . newline newline spectators : ooohhh ! ! ! ! newline newline jack stands up and towers over him . newline newline jack : and stay down , bitch ! newline newline jack gives marcus a wink and walks off with his posse . marcus gets up and sees jessica with her friend laughing at him . he walks over to them . newline okay . this is the hardest part ,  i explained to my friend , vlorg .  this is where they start killing each other .  newline newline  have nt they been killing each other the whole time ?  vlorg asked . she had a good point . a set percentage of humans are programmed to kill from the beginning of the game , and they start on day 1 . the percentage can vary over time , based on various factors , but it is always above any other of the race options in the game . newline newline  yes , they have ,  i said ,  but this is where they start bunching up into giant groups and they really start killing each other  . newline newline  seems pretty peaceful for now ,  vlorg said . newline newline  i know , but just wait . right now there are 47 nations , which can change at any time . none of the leaders are ordering any wars yet , but many of them are building enormous weapons just in case they need to kill later .  newline newline  how do you stop it ?  newline newline  it s really hard ,  i said .  you have to distract them from fighting from each other . you can try to tank the losing country s economy so they ll lose sooner and the war will end , but eventually there will be a war so big that they ll wreck their planet completely . these little fuckers would rather win a fight than keep their planet hospitable .  newline newline  what if you drugged them ?  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  you know , like how they do in operations ? you got an operation once and you said you could nt remember any of it . and they gave you a drug beforehand so you would nt be afraid .  newline newline  i was nt afraid ,  i said . this was a lie , but i liked being the tough one in our friendship . vlorg is my best friend , and i want her to be able to rely on me . you know , in case of emergencies . vlorg s family died of plague a few years back , and i m not her sister by blood but we re close enough that it does nt matter . i m the closest thing to a family she has . newline newline  sure ,  she said , smiling . she knew i was full of shit . newline newline  how long has it been ?  she asked . newline newline  a little over 200,000 years . farthest i ve ever made it . they re gon na start blasting the hell out of each other soon .  newline newline  can i try ?  vlorg asked . newline newline  knock yourself out . i m gon na go get some food , want any ?  i had already beat my record so i figured , why not let it go to hell ? newline newline i went outside to wait for a snarkv to pass by . usually it takes about twenty minutes , but that day i waited a full forty minutes before one came crawling by . some days your food comes fast . other days you ve got ta wait . i leapt onto the animal , catching it with my claws . typically i would just snatch it with my teeth , but i was about to share with vlorg and that would be simply unhygenic . newline newline i went inside to cut up the snarkv , came back into my room and to my surprise vlorg was still alive ! i mean , obviously she was still alive but she had kept the humans alive too . newline newline  how did you do it ?  i asked . newline newline  acid trip ,  she said with a devious grin . newline newline  what s that ?  newline newline  i noticed that there was a large group of people who were nt killing each other , and a lot of them were using the drug . so i put a bunch of it in the rivers . now they re all trying to be artists . not really sure why . but they re alive , and that s what counts , right ?  newline newline  yeah . i wonder what will happen next . dang , vlorg . i need to invite you over to help with this more often . we might beat a record together .  newline newline  that would be cool !  vlorg is nt much of a gamer , so of course i was psyched when she said that . newline newline  hey , mnina .  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  do you think something like humans exists ?  newline newline  i do nt know ,  i said .  it s a pretty big universe .  newline newline  it is ,  she said ,  it really is . rules were somewhat reasonable : instead of worshipers , acts of worship counted . thus , one devouted worshiper could easily be worth more than several casual ones . newline newline first move was obvious : ask people to do things they would ve done anyway and get free worships . it did give me quite a boost and supplies me with influence points even now , when i i have little to no temples left . however , everyone copied that so i do nt really have an advantage that way . newline newline in fact , thigs were pretty ugly for me for several last turns . newline newline i ve lost almost all selfidentified followers . i did have couple buildings left  pile of rocks in the middle of the desert turns out to be pretty durable design  not handy for storing wheat though   so technically i have nt lost yet but i m pretty close to . what could i do ? newline newline yes , i could send a new gospel . you do nt have to worry about civil war decimating your followers when you do nt have any . however , they will notice . those few followers i d get would be just killed and i would have burned influence points for naught . newline newline besides , gospels are not going to do anything decisive . leading ones are just a mashup of what was before them . either i do something similar and do nt get decisive advantage , or i do something new and it flops , or i do something new and it is a success and others just copy it . newline newline also , followers enjoyed having gospels too and started making up their own . thinking that you can outsmart think tank of several billions is not pride , it s just plain stupidity . no gospels then . newline newline they should not be able to copy my move because it would rely on some inherent differences . that s how i win . newline newline that would be easy . all they have is torture , sin and suffering . i have cats . cats are love , cats are life . newline newline people like cats so i will give them tools to worship cats easily . some information exchange network . let s just hope that they enjoy seeing cats more than seeing an infidel blown up . newline newline what about my followers though ? i wo nt win if i only rely on ones that worship me passively . i need active doers ! i need some rebranding so nobody would think that this little group are my followers but symbols and rituals will be there nevertheless . newline newline this wo nt be a gospel because it does not directly teach or demand anything . no , it will be something more subtle . not even an idea , just a style , technique . newline newline i shall encourage them to experiment with imagining themselves as creatures of other kin . i suppose the  kinternet  would be a good name for that information exchange network . by the time they start actively longing to live as other species , first batch of fursuits will be ready . i ll leave discovery of biotech to themselves . why convert people to followers when you can convert them straight to apostles ? newline newline followers like entertainment  especially those moving pictures . however , those are pretty expensive to make . they have another technique used in making moving pictures for children that is cheaper . let s use style that makes it clear that moving pictures are not for children . adding all females big boobs will do . newline newline and , of course , cat ears . newline newline cheaper production means more production , meaning higher chance that some masterpieces will be made besides usual 95  of crap . through new means of communications , ones that are most worth spreading will be spread . especially among preadults exposed to new technologies . those will be building the future and they ll have a vision of the future that i gave them . newline newline have a fun being defeated by   this   http : createapk.comproject201408jinhpanimecatgirlwallpaperimage118947animecatgirlwallpaper.jpg   , mohhamed ! i

the solar realm from a great deal away , if they were astronomically large ... . and yet amymone did nt notice any sort of unreal size to the objects here . made for a man either kimahn s size or barely larger , furlined clothes , heaping piles of pelts , and even human remains simply sat in antiquity around her ... nothing so tall that it would overwhelm completely . newline newline  ffather

giants that d roamed midgar as well as jotunnheim . heimdallr had been one of these . newline newline this room itself defied possibility . it was not simply a man s scrivening chamber , nor was it a stonewalled dwelling like those in nhanon . dveldheim was simply a scrap of granite in this place , and brobdinia ... a single ember , she pondered , could likely contain the whole of it . newline newline  i know of your needs , my child . favored of lsa . you were his very image from the day you sprang forth from delila s womb . i recall telling freya   huginn , or muninn , interrupted him with a cry .  oh yes , you are right . i was telling freyr that this little maid in front of me now would someday ascend to where her parents had never seen , to intercede for a man whose father had slain hers . the sins of a father should never visit upon a child if they reject him . and valery s children ... .  a deep , booming laugh erupted from the worldfather .  why , only one of them obeyed him ! the other three wish nothing to do with his loathsome acts .  newline newline  ... father , does he have three ? or simply two ?  newline newline  you do not know ?  newline newline  no ,  amymone admitted , though she d been certain janiu and his brothers were the only ones she d ever seen in nhanon . it was entirely possible valamor had charmed one more creature .  but gany would .  newline newline  ah yes . ganymede . dear little thing ... she told freyr off when she was nine . he wanted so badly to be the husband to a fiery woman such as she . but she loves valery s son kimahn ! that furry rekkr !  newline newline  she s very fond of him , and he of her.  carefully she edged past a ball , pausing only to look into it . was it her imagination , or did she see sol itself in those depths ?  oh my ! father , is this the vault of the universe ? do you watch all of us from here ?  newline newline a great wall moved aside  bleakly , looking up , she realized it had not been one . some stone sledge had been laid here , and the hand that held it  newline newline  you seem surprised , my daughter.  endless dark loomed before and above her . newline newline hhis eye  ! weaving on her feet , lungs filling with smoke and leathers , amymone wilted ungracefully to the floor .jupiter approaches again , the magma runs too slow ...  newline newline my eyes widened . ever since i moved to these mountains months ago , i ve been hearing thoughts  they are faint but vast . there is a cave in my mind , and this voice echoes inside endlessly . usually , the thoughts are incomprehensible  meaningless chatter that i had gotten used to . but tonight , i ve been hearing words . fragments elusive and strange . newline newline who are you ? i can hear your thoughts , i willed silently . i used to transmit my own thoughts onto other people , as a sort of joke  no one would understand where the foreign words came from , or how to respond to them . newline newline hello , little one .  it sounded almost surprised , but not really . as if it had been waiting for someone , but he had come later than expected . newline newline who are you ? why do your thoughts fill my mind s volume , like a heated gas ?  newline newline your people have called me by different names throughout the eons .  it sounded gently amused . newline newline what name would you prefer ?  newline newline i believe gaia would be one quite familiar to you .  newline newline i gasped . that means i was speaking with ... oh my god . this is a great honor , gaia .  newline newline it is certainly a pleasure for me . i can not recall when i have spoken with one of yours  and so directly , too .  newline newline for a few minutes , i was silent . i was bursting with a million things to ask . but what to say first ? suddenly , with a lump rising in my throat , i realized what needed to be said . gaia , i know the apology of a single , little human must mean nothing , but i am so sorry for what we have done  and what we still do  to you . we have hurt you for centuries ...  newline newline this time , she did laugh , a strange thing to hear reverberate through the wells of my mind . i accept your singular apology , but i must inform you that it is quite misdirected .  newline newline a pause . i do nt understand .  newline newline your kind has done almost nothing to me . nothing that will remain for a long time .  it seemed to heave a huge , contented sigh here . i have experienced much more damage  asteroid bombardment , the moon tearing its body from my injured one , sudden gravitational tugs from stormy black holes that core the center of this galaxy .  newline newline i began to see her point . but then ... who would i properly apologize to ?  newline newline yourselves .  newline newline what ? i was baffled .  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  newline newline the damage your kind has done , the carelessness they have wrought  i will survive it . i have weathered far worse . in a mere thousand or million years  it is all the same to me  , nothing will remain of my old scars .  newline newline it suddenly began to dawn on me where she was going with this . i felt a shiver run down my spine . newline newline it is your kind that will suffer . you will ruin the land , and yourselves . and then you will perish , a speck , a mote in the annals of time .  newline newline silence filled my mind as i pondered deeply about these words . i had always known them , truth be told . but hearing it from her made it too real . she must have sensed my despair , for she added : newline newline or perhaps not . perhaps your kind will realize in time , and save yourselves . but remember one thing , little one .  newline newline  yes ?  i croaked out loud . yes ?  newline newline i will always remember you  all of you . your existence has been so ephemeral , so fragile  but you have glowed . yes , even in so little time , you have shone brightly . and i will remember this light well . solemn silence filled the entire conference room . hell , it could ve been the entire world for all i knew . it had all been explained in its complexity how no one else would ever die , aside from the name spoken during this televised , radio broadcasted , vlogged , podcasted , live streamed and all other forms of recording . newline newline that name was mine ... i mean , surely it was nt . my name is pretty generic . a thousand other people probably have the same one . logically , i had a fairly good chance it was definitely not me . however , the one who spoke the name happened to be speaking on behalf of god . yep . the mettatron . the way it said it was quite clearly addressing someone listening , and that peraon had to be me . i could feel it resonating in my soul . newline newline i was currently sitting alone in my apartment . i had just turned twenty this year , which also marked the first year of my independence from my parents roof . i paid for everything in there in full . no bills to speak of either , and no loan sharks breathing down my neck . i was especially proud of the fact that i had no credit cards to speak of . i had so many other personal achievments too . i lost 80 lbs , got a career as a diet counselor , and even managed to get a scholarship . newline newline its funny how a single thought of death puts your being into perspective . from this shocked state , a single question was asked from the audience . it will haunt me into the afterlife . newline newline  who ?  newline newline the mettatron never skipped a beat , and i supposed explained who i was , and where i was . i stopped listening though as i was currently trying to absorb certain facts in my life . newline newline i became aware of someone else in my apartment . sitting with me on the couch was an angel .  i mean the word angel in more meanings than one .  she sat there on the far end , giving us more than a body s space between us . newline newline  you alright ?  she asked after a while . i looked at her , but she did nt return the gaze . she had this placcid look upon her face that was firmly locked onto my television that came free with my cell phone .  feel any despair ?  newline newline  ... ... nah ,  i sighed , kicking off my shoes . i was ready to go into work today , but i had a feeling i was going to take a lot of time off .  i m just ... processing ...  newline newline she hummed in response and shifted position to get comfortable . newline newline  ... ... so ... what happens now ?  i ask nonchalantly .  am i supposed to be whisked away to heaven ? struck down to hell ? ... casually led into limbo ?  newline newline  not necessarily ,  she said flatly .  the fine print is that you will be the last human death . when , where , how is ... well , up to you . as for after ...  newline newline i looked at her with my head in my hands . i was surprisingly calm and just  aware  of myself . newline newline  the boss wants you to decide where you go after death . think of it as a ... participatory trophy they give out at little league sports .  newline newline  because everyone wins , right ?  newline newline  yep .  newline newline another break from talking . i was completelt alright with it . it gave me a moment to collect my thoughts . newline newline  ... ... are you gon na hang around until then ?  i asked . she nodded in response . newline newline  well , in that case ... i guess i ll go and , uh ...  i begin while standing up . it felt like my body was made of concrete .  ... prep my bed for you .  newline newline  not necessary  newline newline  nah . not having it . my house , my rules . guests get master bedroom . master of the house gets the couch ,  i say quite adamantly . i was looking for some form of control in my life now , and better start with the little things . newline newline  you were always stubborn . fine ,  she yawned with a stretch . i had wandered into my kitchen and opened the fridge . newline newline  want anything ms . angel ?  i call while grabbing myself a can of pepsi . newline newline  not pepsi , and just call me azira ,  she replied . i got her a glass of water . after tending to my guest , i called my boss and told him i m not coming in . he was alright with that . said i still have nt used any vacation days . newline newline  newline newline i distinctly remember crashing on the couch at noon that day , after finally beating skyrim , yet woke up nude in my bed with azira cuddling me  also nude  the next day . if there was any doubt in my mind that it was all just a dream , it shattered at that moment . i got up , got dressed , and went outside . azira followed me and somehow seemed normal to be out on the streets with me . newline newline apparently she was a guardian angel . my guardian angel . i always thought i got lucky . i certainly felt less lucky after hearing her perspective of my less than fine moments . newline newline i expected to be bombarded by news and media crews . a perk of being nobody is complete anonimity though . so , no having to talk to people . i also expected something to change today . maybe rioting and anarchy because no death means no punishment for everyone else , right ? heck , even the best case scenario would be society improving overnight . as far as i knew , nothing changed . newline newline i walked passed an electronics store , and watched the news for a minute . global warming . same old same old . the new arguement i guess was we didnt need to worry about anyone dying except that one guy . fuck that guy . the next topic was medical care , to which i walked away from . newline newline i continued to my usual spot to eat . its one of those ,  we have the best  around  diners . i got a seat at the bar . usually , i hogged a booth to myself . newline newline i ordered , ate with azira , and was denied the right to pay . i was making a noble sacrifice according to the owner . newline newline i walked down the street again and got threatened to be killed by several upstanding people . a ceo , an elderly woman who knit sweaters for cancer patients , and a local teen in a  gang .  they all were of the same opinion   why should we even care about you ?  newline newline i went back home , azira in tow and found the government there . apparently a bigwig thought it d be a good idea to get my opinion of all this since i was going to be that last person to die and ... well ... no media found my apartment yet . he asked how i felt , what i was going to do now , and all that . newline newline  ... i am the last person to die . i am a nobody who has no ties anywhere . i am the last person who will ever know what heaven is , maybe hell if i want to . i ve been made out by many as someone to forget . too bad you ll never know me , so good luck forgetting . you will all know what it is to never die , but then i ll be the only one who could ever appreciate whatever it is i do next . you guys could do the exact same things i do , but you would never appreciate it like me . you could go skydiving , horseback riding and do everything i could and more , but you ll never have a bucket list , and never have an ending to your story . i will . newline newline if there is one thing i will gladly take from being the last person to die , it ll be having a good end .  newline newlinei ve seen my parents watch these television shows . an absentminded individual letting all of their worries go in the fumes being created in their battered living room . while in the making , they are enclosed in their house , windows shut , all suited up , ensuring that their cover does nt get leaked by the smell of their clothes . newline newline i do nt like to compare myself to those people , as i am only nine . but i am a pretty smart child , knowing the benefits of eating my own concoctions i have created in my playroom closet . the one that only i know about and what lays within . newline my bookcase filled with dr. seuss books and normal activities kids should be doing leans against the closet door . inside , tupperware containers containing my own home remedy : crayon paste , are found . newline newline home remedy for what , you may ask ? developing superpowers . depending on the color of crayon that i choose to consume , a superpower i would like to develop in my teen years comes with , as long as i continue to spoon it into my mouth each and every day . of course i pick the blue crayons . blue like the neverending bright sky , stretched above in the daylight . the fact that i could be flying in just a few years amazes me . newline newline i hope dr. seuss has my back , because if he blows my cover , i am not ready to face my teen years without the ability to fly . i m also not ready to spend them grounded , as that would nt be too good , either .i glance at my lifetracking device on my wrist , which clearly states i have ten minutes left to live . it may seem strange to you , but in my society , it is a well known concept . basically , every ten years , one unlucky son of a bitch get chosen to become a sort of blood sacrifice to the creatures that used to roam the land . and basically , you can either kill people for more time , or let it run down until you die . you only get twenty years of time , if you were chosen , to live from the moment you are born . newline newline i was sadly chosen . newline newline but i refuse to kill . newline newline so for my last ten minutes , i m gon na have some fun . newline newline i quickly grab the bag i had been waiting to use until this day . the contents are : a reallooking plastic gun , lighter fluid , matches , and a mask . after putting the mask on , i run out the door and head towards my neighbors house . their kid is an idiot and constantly forgets to lock his car  a very expensive car too  and always leaves his keys inside . this should teach him . i start up his car and speed off , tires squealing . newline newline i stop by my exgirlfriend s house , knowing she s out with a different woman right now . bitch . i grab the lighter fluid and douse the front of it , including her lawn and spare car . then i break one of her windows and douse the room inside . a get back and toss a light match on her lawn , igniting it instantly . i drive off again , this time , heading to the bank . newline newline six minutes . newline newline when i reach the bank , i head inside with the fake gun and , now empty , bag . people immediately start screaming . i walk up calmly to one of the women working and say ,  put all money from richard a. stevens in the bag . and make it snappy , i m on a time limit .  she leaves and comes back thirty seconds later with numerous stacks of money . i shove in my bag , and run out the door and hop in the car in ten seconds flat . newline newline richard was my sister  abusive , rich ex husband . god , i hate him . such a prick . newline newline well , it s time to cause some havoc . newline newline i drive down the fairly empty road ... on the wrong side . i m laughing as the cars swerve around me . and , finally , i m hearing sirens . the cops ! i ve always wanted to be part of a police chase . though , not as the one being chased but whatever . i drive around away from the police , still laughing , still speeding , still about to die . newline newline two minutes . newline newline i change courses and am now heading towards the pier . my mom used to take me their as a kid . i ve always loved it there . so peaceful . newline newline one minute . newline newline i see it . at the end of the street , is the beautiful beach and peaceful pier . newline newline thirty seconds . newline newline i am only about twenty yards away now . newline newline twenty seconds . newline newline i ca nt believe this is it . newline newline ten seconds . newline newline i drive onto the pier . newline newline five seconds . newline newline almost ... newline newline four seconds . newline newline i crash through the railing . newline newline three seconds . newline newline i smile . newline newline two seconds . newline newline i hit the water . newline newline one second . newline newline goodbye . newlinei have waited here for centuries . ever since my creators saw the potential in humanity , ever since they began to create , since they began to make tools and understand their place in life . i have waited for their probes to reach me , for them to try and understand the planet i call home . i have watched their attempts . newline newline i have watched them . i have watched them create the great pyramids , and destroy civilizations that stood in the way of their goals . humanity has a great desire for survival , i have learned that much , and their desire for survival is found in all of them . i thought they were going to fail when they devastated their world with fire , just as countless civilizations failed before them . i thought i would return to my creators . but like their mythical phoenix , they rose from the ashes . i thought they would come to me sooner , when they began to leave their planet and discover the natural satellite that surrounded them . but they stopped searching , they stopped trying to see me and turned to their world . for good reason . they had problems and they recognized that . i have seen countless other civilizations fail in that lesson , and fall . but humanity , they continue to rise . newline newline so i continued to wait , as per my instructions  separated from my creators , millions of lightyears from home , a simple unit orbiting the planet they call pluto . a time ago , i thought they were close , but their probes were rudimentary , i had to wait until they sent another . and another . and another . newline newline until finally , they have answered our calls , they have finally begun to do what i calculated would have taken them hundreds of years more . they have finally reached me , in an advanced probe that continues to talk to them , continues to send readings back to them . newline newline humanity has done much , and they have finally begun to realize their potential in conquering the stars . newline newline i have notified my creators . they are coming . newline newline it will be hundreds of years before they arrive . until they do , i am to go to them , as a herald of the words  you are not alone in this galaxy .  newline newline i have waited millennium to utter those words . i have seen hundreds of civilizations rise and fall , only to tell my creators of their destruction , only to extend my creators life so they could continue their reign . but humanity , they are different . i recognize that . i have recognized that for years . but i had to wait , i had to make sure that they were ready . newline newline now they are . now i can finally reveal myself to them , i can finally tell my creators that there is a species that can continue their reign . newline newline i can finally let my creators die , so humanity may take their place as the rulers of this galaxy . newline newline they are coming . they will teach them . humanity will rise from my creators ashes , just as they always have . newline newline humanity will reign .

newline  newline i write stories , but i ca nt make links work , i guess ? i m cold , father .  newline newline  do nt worry , brett . it should nt be long now .  calem knew that was a lie . the nearest town was likely only a few miles away , but the snow would slow them considerably . not to mention what would happen if they got lost . still , he pulled his son closer for warmth . together , they trudged onward . newline newline it was nt long before they came to a clearing . something was wrong though , and both father and son could feel it . the air was eerily quiet , and while the wind still blew it was a soft breeze compared to the biting gale a few feet behind them . instead of providing light , the moon only made the shadows lengthen . one of these shadows made calem gasp quietly . on the other side of the clearing was a massive demon . newline newline the demon stood still as a statue , staring out into the forest . one might believe it was stone , and only its wings proved otherwise . they flapped in the breeze like the tattered banners of a defeated army . its body was covered in strange growths , almost like plants had grown underneath its skin . the demon s head was topped with two horns , one nearly twice the size of the other . newline newline a twig snapped under the brett s boot . the demon turned to glare at him , eyes glowing like dying coals . but it did nt move beyond that . it unnerved calem , that such a powerful and evil beast would do nothing while they were practically at its mercy . calem grabbed his son by the wrist and ran , not daring to look back . newline newline the demon returned to its silent vigil , watching and waiting .that day was the day of my graduation from hell academy . newline newline i earned my degree in torture methods , though it was nt my best subject . i just did nt have the talent for it . i mean , i could disembowel someone if i had to , but i never developed the same flair for it that my classmates had . newline newline i had thought i was doomed to a  after  life of mediocrity , but i got a mysterious invitation from one of the school counselors midway through my first semester . i met with her , and she pointed me in the right direction . with her guidance , i had decided to double major , picking up a degree in prison security . i had aced all those classes , coming out at the top of my grade  finally , i had found something i was good at ! newline newline i was aiming to get assigned to one of the patrol wards . rather than actively torturing souls , i could work on keeping them locked up securely in hell . there was a strange satisfaction that came from seeing their broken faces , knowing that i was the one keeping them from any chance of freedom . of course , the torture wards were much more prestigious  hence my degree  but i knew i would be happier in patrol . newline newline my counselor took my papers , looking them over intently . slowly , a devilish grin spread across her face . newline newline  i was hoping for patrol ...  i began , trailing off . i was nt sure what she would think . newline newline she looked up at me .  you ve surpassed our expectations ,  she said , still grinning .  i have an even better assignment for you .  she paused for a moment , letting that sink in .  have you ever heard of the miscellaneous ward ?  newline newline i racked my brain , trying to recall the name . it sounded vaguely familiar , though i could nt remember what they did . newline newline she laughed , as if reading my thoughts .  do nt worry , few know what it does . it s always tacked on as an afterthought , to divert attention . we re legally required to bring it up   she glanced at the ceiling , as if gesturing to heaven   but we do our best to keep anyone from digging too deep .  newline newline by this point , i was curious . a better job than patrol ? most people would be talking about torture , but my counselor knew me too well . newline newline she leaned in towards me , over her desk .  you know the story of lucifer , right ?  newline newline i leaned back in my chair , unsure of what she was getting at .  it s an old myth ,  i replied uneasily , recalling the story i d been told since i was a child .  that he was the original fallen angel , the first one to oppose god . when his conquest of heaven failed , he was sealed in the deepest , darkest part of hell . hell only exists to keep him imprisoned .  i smiled .  he s more for our image on earth , as the king of hell . it s an entertaining thought , but ultimately , he does nt exist .  newline newline she sat back down , a smug expression on her face .  except that he does ,  she said casually , as if this were nt huge news .  miscellaneous is the name of the ward designated with keeping him locked away .  newline newline my expression must have betrayed my bewilderment . lucifer was real ? newline newline  oh , he s real , alright ,  she continued .  see , the deal is , it s in our best interest to keep him locked away . if given the opportunity , he would wage a second war on heaven . he would organize us into an army , and kill anyone who did nt join his ranks . but he would never succeed : he could nt beat heaven back when he was at the height of his power , when he still had the abilities of one of heaven s angels . all his armies would be destroyed . it s a loselose scenario for us demons , who just want to torture humans in peace .  newline newline the idea made sense . i was still slightly skeptical , but i figured she would nt be lying to me about something this big . after all , why bother ? if you re feeling especially cruel one day , you can always head to the torture ward for a few hours . newline newline  anyways , in miscellaneous , you ll be tasked with ensuring he ca nt escape . for the good of hell , we need people who are devoted to  and good at  their jobs . you re a reasonable man  i know you can see the benefit of keeping him imprisoned .  newline newline i did . newline newline i smiled an evil smile , preparing for my new job . newline newline  when do i start ? now and again , i used to set a timer , sit still , close my eyelids and pace my breaths for five minutes . it s funny how a time as short as five minutes can open up and seem so long doing that . weeks , months , years have whizzed by me . ten days is nt much time at all , but when i got the letter , that time opened up too , and , well , it almost seems like too much . newline newline it s like the immensity of time , the possibilities of what to do in  ?  it , with  ?  it , jumped out at me . i think that s what scares me the most : how valuable it is . i m scared i m going to waste it and scared that , if i do something with it , i could put it to better use elsewhere . newline newline running off and trying to check things off a bucket lists might make for good movies . kids who still got a lot of years ahead of them might have a good time doing something like that . i m not going to jump up and do anything like that , though , and i do nt think many do . newline newline i do nt know if i m at peace with myself . i m not going to work myself up trying to be or worrying about it . i am worried , in quiet kind of way . i used to go swimming in the ocean . i d think about all the things beneath the surface that could get me . it s kind of like that , except i know now exactly when it s going to get me . that makes it not as bad . newlinehistory classes were always my favourite . i loved the renaissance particularly . it was all gorgeous paintings and poetry . grand depictions of heaven as this cloud filled place with flying children , and hell as a fiery pit full of red skinned monsters . newline newline well imagine my delight when we found out it was all true . the visions these artists had were direct from the source  they had been there . turns out every so often , the doors between the three realms open for heaven and hell to engage in warfare over humanity . newline newline last time had been a stalemate , with human society left untouched by the armies . this time it was clear we would nt be so lucky . both teams were coming harder than ever before . this was it . both wanting to claim humanity or die trying . newline newline except ... newline newline the paintings were seriously right on the nose . not even joking . everything from the soldiers to the weapons . newline newline and you know what there is nt a whole lot of in renaissance paintings ? newline newline ak47s . newline newline and tanks . newline newline and nuclear missiles . newline newline so yeah , humanity fought back with full force . we originally expect to side with  the big g  , what with him being our creator and all . turns out he s a complete dick though . the flooding of the earth ? drunken accident . the ten plagues of egypt ? also a drunken accident . jesus ? well you get the idea . basically the dude has a drinking problem and a shitty tendency to take it out on us . he s been alright for the last millenia , but he s honestly just unpleasant to be around . newline newline satan was a lot nicer than any of us expected , but turns out he s also really racist . has some unresolved issues with the chinese . we did nt question it , and we did nt ally with him either . newline newline all of that left us in an odd  though comfortable  position  enough firepower to blow up heaven and hell , and no reason not to . so we put it to a vote . every human gets a say in what we do with our power . personally i ll be voting to bring back some dead artists and musicians .beezlebub drifted hazily awake , and immediately wished he had nt . his head felt like someone had pierced it with their pitchfork and there was a crust of something gold and sticky smeared across his left hindquarter . it had nt been a good night . newline newline he gazed blearily around him . his legs were stretched out over the tattered remains of what had once been a very nice couch  maybe one of the ones that had come down with ghengis khan ?  which since fallen heavily from grace and now resided in a dingy apartment in southwest third circle , hell . through the window he could make out the harsh neon light of the sign from the brothel next door , kingdom cum . newline newline he stood up and winced as his tornup hooves met the flaming floor . newline newline  yo beez , you up ?  newline newline it was his sometimesgirlfriend , lucy furr . lucy was a parttime dancer at the kc next door , and she definitely looked the part  smooth humanoid curves and long muscular legs all covered in a fine layer of black peach fuzz . ravishing . today , she had big lumps of black sheep wool wrapped around each of her four calves . newline newline  what the heaven is that ?  beezlebub scoffed , gesturing at her footwear .  you look like a cancerous donkey .  newline newline she walked in and threw a balledup hamburger wrapper at him . newline newline  they re called legwarmers , dipshit .  newline newline she paused studied his face intently . newline newline  it s a human thing ,  she said softly . newline newline he froze . newline newline  you went up ? how ? when ? where ?  newline newline no demon had gained access to the human world since years earlier when a few had climbed thtough the hole left after hiroshima . newline newline she nodded .  there s a small cavern we found in a place called san francisco . apparently there s a lot of gay people there so some christians have been building a little passageway down here to try to get rid of them .  newline newline beezlebub blinked .  but why the fuck would we care..  newline newline lucy shrugged impatiently .  who knows ? point is we can get back up , and there s been a lot going on up there since the thirties . there are some pretty interesting new inventions floating around in 1989 .  newline newline beezlebub snorted .  i woul nt call ugly socks an interesting invention .  newline newline lucy raised an eyebrow .  oh no ? well what about ... this ?  newline newline she held out a small palmfull of white powder . newline newline  give this a sniff .  newline newline beezelebub eyed it distrustfully . newline newline  it looks like some angel shit .  newline newline  oh trust me , it s not ,  she smirked . newline newline beezlebub out his snout and gave a deep snuffle . the last thing he heard before he lapsed into wild , fanatical ecstasy was her fading words :  they call it cocaine .  newline newline  newline newline october 17 , 1989 was a beautiful day in san francisco  mideighties with a gentle breeze . the bay sparkled blue , the eucalyptus trees seemed extra fragrant . then , disaster struck . newline newline building after building collapsed and fires and chaos erupted all over the city . on airwaves all over the country , news anchors called it  the most destructive earthquake of our time .  at the end of it , 67 people were dead and whole neighborhoods were left in ruin . newline newline seven miles below the city , beezlebub was on his knees , blackhorned hands clasped around lucy s legwarmers in front of him . newline newline  please ! please luce !  he pleaded ,  you ve got to get me more of that stuff .  newlineevery child has an imaginary friend when growing up . how does one feel when their imaginary friend grows up with him , and becomes famous with him ? jim looked down at his hand one last time . it might be silly , but a tear rolled down his

 kermit responded . it was true . kermit was basically jim henson . that was evident to his friends , family , anyone who ever knew him . while some of his other characters were these crazy ,

and you just started bumbling nonsense . i couldn  t understand a word you said and annie was standing next to me , and we were exchanging looks when you kept going on and on , some incoherent gibberish  we didn  t even think you were speaking english  and then you took out a crumpled piece of paper , and you tried to thrust it into one of my shirt pockets but i thought you were trying to grab my boob . do you remember ? i started screaming and you just ran away , just dropped the paper on the floor . my curiosity got the best of me . i grabbed it while annie wasn  t looking and we went off to class . go out with me  is what the note said , along with your phone number . when i read it in class i couldn  t stop laughing aloud , i almost got kicked out . i don  t know why i didn

more desperately : newline newline listen to me michael , please ! i love you ! please just know that , please ! you proposed to me at the park next to my house . remember ? it was the park where we had our first kiss ? the park where , where we laid on the grass and looked at the stars until the sun came up , remember ? and , and it was the park that is right by that army base  so there was that time when a tank drove by us on the other side of the fence in the middle of the night  wasn  t that crazy ? don  t you remember ? please remember , i  ve been visiting you every week and , and i just want to tell you that my answer is yes ! i swear , it  s yes ! yes ! i know i was hesitant then and i didn  t know what the right answer was , and i  m so so sorry that i fucked up and hesitated , but i want you to know that my answer is a full on yes ! yes i want to marry you ! i love you ! do you remember me now ? look at me in the eyes michael , please ! please , doctor . newline newline she looks back and forth from doctor to man , frantic but hopeful , her eyes gleaming with uncertainty . newline newline the doctor looks towards the man in white with the blank expression , who is fidgeting in his seat . the man takes both hands from his sides , fast at start but slow as he raises them , like unsticking them from his sides as if they were glued there . he slowly folds his hands together as if in prayer , nestled neatly and symmetrically on the table . newline newline the man opens his mouth to speak , after the long pause : newline newline i literally can not see eye to eye with you because you are literally a talking vertical line . newline newline the doctor starts to snicker in the corner . newline newline the woman : newline newline what ? newline newline the man , trudging his words , using his finger to draw a diagram in the air : newline newline you are a vertical line , sticking out of a slightly larger horizontal line , and then everything around you is just , linelike , as well  doctor ! line please . line . i see another talking line ! newline newline the doctor takes a pen out of his medical coat pocket and starts to jot down crude notes on the

lifeless ? flat ? newline newline man : newline newline yes , one of those , get it away from me , it  s wiggling around . it scares me . newline newline the doctor ceases his snickering . the woman ,

you can read right ?  newline newline one of the hooded figures nodded . newline newline  since we re allies and everything ... do you think you could ... you know , lend us a hand ?  newline newline the figure that nodded pulled out a deck of cards . newline newline  ugh , not this again .  newline newline one of the carders motioned for silence . and gazing deep into the words that lay before

newline  take heroine and crap all over the carpet whilst frothing at the mouth ? !  newline newline  hahahhah !  the figures laughed in unison . newline newline  hmmmm , you speak wise words card

settled then , gather your men , we shall end this feud once and for all .  newline newline that really excited the carders , they were hungry for the blood of the disney folk , and the high priest

my mouth was still slightly open as i turned my gaze to the child . she sits on the green canvas chair , gripping the metal frame with her head faced slightly toward the ground causing her hair to cover most of her face . she is clothed with a grey , worn flannelette jacket over a yellow shirt with a bear on it , a pair of black track pants , and nonmatching sneakers . her body language showed just how uncomfortable she was in the situation , as she should be , given her situation . that s if it is true , that is . newline newline newline newline in 2138 , after thirteen years of war , humans were completely eradicated from the planet  by their own creations . silks  , was the word they used , named from our artificial , silicon based brains . we used to coinhabit the planet , living side by side as neighbors , coworkers , and even lovers . it did nt take long before silks began to realize what humans were doing to the planet , and that both human and silk life could be sustained for the foreseeable future . so some silks took affirmative action . radicals became activists , activists became movements , movements became armies , and the armies scourged the planet of sentient life . this was not a universally shared opinion , some silks even fought on the side of the humans , and some took no part at all , and some found a way to shut off their emotions , and act with complete pragmatism . there were many innocents killed , on both sides . you either fought , or you died . i fought in the war , despite my disposition . i had once loved a human , but he was taken from me by the artificial . i swore revenge on those responsible , but eventually those dreams fade and dissipate . newline newline newline newline i did , however find it ironic that the silks now lived a similar lifestyle to those that preceded us , the same lifestyle they were condemned for . it was nt long after the end of the human race that we realized we needed them , otherwise our only goal was instinctual survival , just like animals . the majority of silks lived in large cities , without real purpose , and mostly without emotions due to the fact that once they were gone , they did nt come back . the largest city is known as the  core  , because it sits relatively centric to everything else , this is where most of the proeracticationists lived . they are the hostiles , as are the majority of others around . but a few of us stayed on the outskirts , in between settlements . just surviving , and looked for a reason to continue . newline newline newline  and you want me to ...  newline newline  to take her to core  newline newline newline i scoffed . newline newline newline  no way . that s impossible . she d be killed before we got to talis  newline newline  eve , i need you to do this . if there is even a chance that we can bring them back , we need to take it .  she pleaded . newline newline newline i still could nt believe any of this . i paced slowly around the tent , the lamp flickering from the dying solar generator . amanda pushed the wheels of her chair closer to me . newline newline newline  i d do it myself . but , well , you know .  she smirked . newline newline  ii ca nt , am .  newline newline newline amanda s eyes filled with tears and sorrow . i think i may have just burnt away her last shred of hope . she dropped her gaze to the floor . i could nt look at her so i shifted my eyes to the girl in the corner . the impossible girl . i was shocked  she was looking straight at me . an emotionless face , broken from the life she had led thus far . her vision seemed to pierce through me . the memories flooded back , and i remembered him again in a way i had nt in years . i sighed , my eyes pushing back emotion . newline newline newline  how do i get there ?  . newline newline newline amanda s head shot up , smiling . newline newline newline  thank you , thank you !  she shouted through tears . i crouched down to meet amanda s face . newline newline  i love you ... but you re not the one i m doing it for . what s her name ?  . newline newline newline amanda looked at the child expectantly . the child opened her mouth and the softest voice emerged . newline newline newline  mary  .the morning sun lazily rises over this quaint irish town . it certainly is nt utopia , but the residents are all rather kind and nice , all

, probably not the only girl he kisses . she deserves better , greg . newline newline greg shuffles downstairs past his daughters room , does she get a kiss greg ! ? newline after a quick breakfast of toast and coffee greg leaves silently for work , did nt your mother ever teach you to eat with your mouth closed greg ? newline newline  good morning , ms murphy ! looks like it will be a nice day  greg probably thinks it will be a nice day because of all the starving children in africa , sadistic bastard . his old loud car coughs and spits it s way down the suburban road , real thoughtful greg

greg wanders around the shop wasting away his pointless existence , also looking for eggs . newline newline  is that all   just hadta grab eggs for the the daughters breakfast  tony glances at his watch  will you not be late to work ?   maybe , but eggs are her favourite  newline greg rushes home with the eggs and then leaves for work , he did nt even put them in the cupboard , nice one greg ! real classy . newline newline greg then has the audacity to speed to work , do you know how many people die every year in car crashes greg ? this criminal should nt even be on the road ! newline newline even after his blatant disregard fire law , order and greg still shows up late for work at the building site . newline newline  you re late   sorry i hadta grab eggs for the family s breakfast , the old ones had fine off   ah sure it s no bother , you re in early most days  newline newline greg works quietly , he s still tired after getting home late from visiting his mother in dublin last night . the doctors say she s getting worse . at least that s what he told his girlfriend , he was more likely off in some strip club or doing for speeding . or drugs . what a shitty guy . newline newline greg ploughed through the day , making sure each stone tested perfectly in the garden wall . what a disgrace of a human being . newline newline  were heading the pub now , are you coming ?  said another builder as work finished but greg was rude enough to throw this polite invitation into the ground , insisting he had to work overtime to cover costs at home . he was putting money away in a jar for his daughters college fee . how about a savings account greg ! ? ever heard of compound interest ? newline newline it was almost dark when greg finally left for home , did nt even drop into the pub to see his mates , how rude ! he stopped to pick up flowers for his girlfriend , should nt you be saving money you selfish prick ! ? newline newline greg only had time to kiss his daughter goodnight and read her a story , struggling with the long words there , eh greg ? you illiterate bastard , spend more time with your kids ! newline newline  how was work sweetheart  he told her all about his day , but left out the speeding part . ca nt even tell the truth to your own girlfriend , disgraceful . after saying goodnight greg heads downstairs and calls his sister to tell her about

black clouds hangs above an expanse of blasted countryside . dark craters pockmark the land , and the corrupted hulks of destroyed war machines lie rusting in the acrid air . amidst this desolation , two elderly women sit on rocking chairs that are curiously undamaged . these are delilah and tabitha . a small table with a tea set is present between them .  newline newline delilah :  it s a bit hot today , is nt it ? newline tabitha :  yes , very hot . time was , you d have to go on holiday for this much heat . newline delilah :  oh , i never liked hot holidays . too many tropical drinks ! newline tabitha :  do you know , i had a tropical drink on an arctic cruise once ? newline delilah :   shocked  you did nt ! newline tabitha :  yes , it put me right off my dinner . newline delilah :  as well it should . newline tabitha :  i said to the man , i said ,  what the devil are you doing serving mai tais while we re skirting greenland ?  newline delilah :  what did he say ? newline tabitha :  he said i should nt have ordered it . newline newline the two women cluck their tongues and shake their heads . a booming voice fills the silence .  newline newline inritus :   o.s .   you are trying my patience . newline newline for the first time , a truly gargantuan demon is revealed to have been standing in front of the women . this is inritus , scourge of mankind and destroyer of the planet earth .  newline newline tabitha :  oh , do you hear that , delilah ? we re trying his patience ! newline delilah :  perhaps he d like a biscuit . newline inritus :  i am right here . newline delilah :  yes , dear , but we re not going to walk over to you . newline tabitha :  not that we mean to be rude hosts ! newline delilah :  no , no , it s just that my knees are nt what they used to be . newline newline tabitha nods and hums in agreement .  newline newline tabitha :  no , not at all , are they ? just yesterday , i took nearly three and a half minutes to get down the stairs ! newline delilah :  it s a good job there are no more stairs , is nt it ? newline inritus :   shouting  enough !  newline newline the demon clenches his fists , and tremors shake the area . delilah watches the ripples in her tea with muted interest .  newline newline inritus :   contd  there are no more stairs because i destroyed them ! i have vanquished the whole of your people , laid waste to your lands , and brought forth the end of this world ! newline tabitha :  yes , dear , we re not blind . newline delilah :  i did think i d gone blind once . newline tabitha :  did you , now ? what happened ? newline delilah :  well , it had to do with the salmon . you see , i ... newline inritus :   interrupting  quell your babbling , fools ! you have been spared only so that you might deliver a message to your creator ! newline newline both women suddenly look very stern .  newline newline tabitha :  here , now ! there s no call to go being rude ! newline delilah :  funny , that s just what i said to the salmon . newline inritus :  tell your master that ... newline tabitha :   interrupting  oi ! not until you apologize ! newline newline a moment of ominous silence passes .  newline newline inritus :  ... sorry . newline delilah :  much better . anyway , i m afraid we ca nt help you . newline inritus :  what ? newline tabitha :  there s no  master  here . newline delilah :  ooh ! do you suppose he means that composer from up the road ? newline tabitha :  no , no , that s  maestro ,  not  master .  newline delilah :  oh , yes . lovely fellow . what ever became of him ? newline tabitha :  he got blown apart when that power plant exploded . newline delilah :  that s a shame . then again , i suppose it sounded better than some of his music ! newline newline the two women titter to one another .  newline newline inritus :  your time here is ending . i suggest you heed my words . newline tabitha :  oh , yes , very well . what is it you want , dear ? newline newline inritus draws himself up to his full , towering height and glowers down at the women .  newline newline inritus :  this realm is mine . all of creation shall fall to my influence , and shall be remade in my name . newline delilah :  i always did like a man with ambition . newline tabitha :  he s not so much a man , though , is he ? newline delilah :  no , not really ... nor all that ambitious , now that i think about it . newline inritus :  ... what do you mean ? newline tabitha :  well , here you are , prattling on about plagiarism . newline inritus :  that s not ... newline delilah :   interrupting   remade in your name ?  a bloody thief , you are . newline tabitha :  why not try making something of your own , dear ? newline delilah :  yes , like that lovely composer up the road . newline tabitha :  the dead one ! newline delilah :  granted , they re all dead now . newline tabitha :  yes , you d have to start by putting things right . newline delilah :  there s no call to be leaving a mess around , is there ? newline newline the demon starts to look incredibly nervous .  newline newline inritus :  what manner of creature are you that you feel no fear in my presence ? newline delilah :   scoffing   creature ,  he says . newline tabitha :  that s kids today for you . no respect for their elders ! newline inritus :  i have existed for eons . my being began before the earth was even a cloud of dust circling its star . newline delilah :  you d think you d have learned some manners by now , then . newline tabitha :  it s like i always say . newline newline delilah nods , and the two women rock in their chairs .  newline newline inritus :  ... what ? newline delilah :  sorry , dear , what was that ? newline inritus :  what do you always say ? newline tabitha :  more than a few things , i d imagine . she talks a lot . newline inritus :  not her ! you ! you said  it s like i always say !  newline delilah :  you see that ? he was listening ! newline tabitha :  that s an improvement then , is nt it ? newline inritus :  stop , stop , stop !  spare me this torment ! i shall destroy you now ! newline delilah :  get on with it , then . newline newline inritus raises a clawed hand , then hesitates .  newline newline inritus :  this is a trick . newline tabitha :  oh , we re much too old for that nonsense . newline delilah :  yes , if you re going to off us , you might as well get it done . newline tabitha :  mind you , we wo nt be delivering any messages to any  creators .  newline delilah :  superstitious rubbish , that is . newline tabitha :  although ... there was that fellow at the warehouse . newline delilah :   crater ,  not  creator .  newline tabitha :  no , those are the things in the ground . newline delilah :  what do you call a man who puts things in crates , then ? newline tabitha :  damned if i know . anyway , i meant the sculptor . newline delilah :  oh , yes ! he fancied himself a creator , did nt he ? had it as his job title and everything . newline inritus :  a human referred to himself as a creator ?  newline newline the women turn their attention back to inritus .  newline newline tabitha :  well , yes , dear ! newline delilah :  it s all in how you see yourself , is nt it ? newline tabitha :  that sculptor could have stood to see himself a bit more often , though . newline delilah :  and to have shaved ! newline inritus :  this ... had not occurred to me . i shall consider it . newline tabitha :  you do that , dear , and come see us again sometime . newline delilah :  yes . do clean up before you leave , though , would you ? newline newline a colossal flash of light covers the area .  newline newline cut to : newline newline int . a sitting room  afternoon newline newline delilah and tabitha

. newline newline fade out .the doctor sat at the command console dejectedly . he had come so far and here was the end . newline newline he thought back to all the people he had touched , mary , sarah , rose , poor rose , rory , amy . so many people he had touched . and killed . they re all dead now . newline newline he could nt decide whether he regretted his life or not . there had been good times but so many bad . he had once said every life is a pile of good things and bad things  and how right he was . newline newline everything was finished now . he had lived for so long that he had become a shadow of what he once was . before he had patience and mercy but over the billions of years he had dwindled into this sham of what he was . a monster . the blood bringer . a failure . newline newline he thought he could fix it all ! save the time lords , save clara , be happy ! no ! he failed on all counts . oh the mistakes he made were terrible . newline newline and now he was at the end . all the clocks had wound down . he was likely the only living thing left now . except the tardis but even that was dying . any moment now it would flicker out and leave him in dark maddening isolation . he could nt even get out  the doors were shut ! newline newline he had a plan though , the final plan . he had a friend called wilf who gave him something long ago . a primitive way to go but damned effective . newline newline no more regenerations now .my wrist hurts and the bleeding keeps getting worse .  focus  i tell myself as i look around and try to remember where i was . the whole area is foggy . i can  t tell what time of the day it is or when i got here . newline newline my head hurts and i can  t think clearly . there is a black suitcase handcuffed to my wrist that  s making the pain even worse . i try to open it , but it  s locked tight . whoever put me here wants me to carry this like some sick twisted joke . newline newline i look through my pocket hoping to find a key or something . the only thing i find is dirty rumpled piece of paper . something  s scribbled in it , but it doesn  t make much sense . the first line reads something like uyo rae edad . iaign . nawt ot tarst lal vero ?  my head hurts too much to make sense of that . newline newline there are four paths i can take . somehow all of them seem vaguely familiar..but also different somehow . i decide to take the north path , let  s see where the road takes me . newline so what do we have today mic ?  the shopkeep asked . his full name was micky meat fists , but these adventurers were coming up with crazier names every day and he didn  t have time to remember them all . what happened to the good old days when they had names like : grey beard , dragonslayer88 , and poondestroyer1 . he was fine with his lot in life . to run his shop and barter and trade with the comers and goers of the realm and he actually prided himself on that . mic , however , was the bane of his existence . he hated this chunky twat . mic was a noob who fought bores in the forest all day to level up , being afraid of raiding and questing hurt his experience , but also his bravado . mic always had trash items and he thought his charisma was higher than it was . always trying to haggle or barter and convince him that his items deserved more than their merit . the shopkeep himself boasted perfect stats in all all trait unrelated to combat and even his combative skills out matched most that visited his outpost . newline newline  well ,  mic said unloading his backpack on the counter ,  we  ve got some armor.  newline newline  mic , that  s cloth.  newline newline  still armor ,  mic smiled .  then i  ve got some boots , and daggers and some ,  he was sifting through the pile trying to find something more he had to off .  welp , this looks to be it . newline newline the shopkeep mulled through all of this  loot  and tallied the figures up in his head .  i can give you 15 for the whole lot.  newline newline  30 ,  mic countered . newline newline  15 , mic ,  he replied . real players will be coming through soon and i don  t have time for this today . newline newline  oh , wait !  mic exclaimed as he dug around in his pocket . he produce a rock darker than night itself fastened to a small polished silver band .  what about this ? found it on a wounded wizard when i looted his body.  newline newline  you looted a wounded player ? mic , you never cease to  he trailed off as the realization of what mic was holding dawned on him . that ring belonged to shazerokk the infallible , the most power wizard in the realm . this ring was said to hold immeasurable power and that the wielder would be nigh invincible . he thought for a moment before he countered . if he seemed to excited mic would ask for the world . newline newline  so ?  mic tapped the ring against the counter top . newline newline  i can offer you the anzironian hammer of power for it ,  the shopkeep replied . newline mic  s eyes widened with excitement ,  deal ! oh wow , an anzironian hammer of power . bye bye boars , helllllooooo trolls !  he handed over the ring and took the hammer .  this is your prized possession . why give it it up for this silly little rock ?  newline newline  you nave ,  he said .  you have no idea the power this ring possesses.  he put on the ring and stretched out his fingers to try and cast a curse on mic . he was not a wizard by nature , but the ring didn  t concern itself with such trivial matters . nothing happened . he tried again . nothing .  what the ?  newline newline  welp , see ya later ,  mic said as he headed for the door . newline newline  wait ! come back with my hammer !  newline newline  you mean my hammer ? nah , think i  ll keep it . you can keep all the other loot and your money though.  and mic was gone . newline newline the shopkeep stared at this rare weapon on his finger and could not understand why it had not worked . then the rock tumbled from the band and fell to the ground . he picked it up and examined it , it was just a rock . why had he not examined it with his own hands first ! ? what a noob move ! the door opened and the next traveler came in and his soul sank a little . today was going to be a long day . newline newline mic ran into the woods where shazerokk was waiting for him . newline newline  did it work ?  the wizard asked . newline newline  yep . just like you said . he didn  t try and look at it first or anything !  mic  s heart was racing .  why  d you help me ?  newline newline  just bored i guess ,  shazerokk replied . and with a flourish of his cape he vanished with a small pop . newline newline mic shrugged his shoulders , tossed his hammer over his shoulder , and began the long hike into the mountains . he had some trolls to smash . newlineso , it s been three weeks since i died . i know i know , everyone says i look a little rough , a little blood stained , head askew , all that nonsense . newline newline i saw my reaper creeping up . he kept checking his watch and giving me this terrifying bony smile . i knew i needed to cross the road , everything looked clear . just when i started to sprint  bam ! out of nowhere , car with no lights on . thing is , right before i got hit , he just disappeared . newline newline we all know how it works . when you die , he s supposed to ferry your soul over to the other side . except mine got distracted . so now my body is just slowly rotting away . i ve been wearing a lot of cologne , trying to avoid showering  the skin starts to fall right off  . people are starting to notice though . my boss keeps asking if things are going well at home , if i ve been evicted , if there was some kind of accident . i ve been trying to assure him that everything is fine , but it really is nt working . newline newline it s been two months now . still no sign of my reaper . i ve lost all of the flesh from my feet now . my knees and elbows are almost in the same state . it s winter , so i m hoping i stay fairly well preserved , but i m worried that once summer hits there wo nt be anything left . i ve stopped sleeping entirely . my apartment is filled with things i just do nt need anymore . i ve started to sell all of my possessions . newline newline three months . i quit my job . there was an ad out in the newspaper for help on a farm several miles outside the city . i sent an email in , and got a quick yes in response . newline newline i wear a large cloak with the hood drawn down most days now , but that s more for my own benefit than my employers . the old man who owns the farm does nt seem to mind my stench and has yet to comment on what s got to be the pretty obvious lack of definition under my clothing . i barely see him anyway . he just leaves a list of tasks for me on the porch each morning . his farm is expansive , mostly crops , but there s are some animals too . i ve been planting a lot of winter wheat . it feels right , somehow , to be working the earth . i ve always hated being outdoors and i hate being near people even more . newline newline eight months since my reaper disappeared . summer has come , and i ve lost all of the flesh from my bones . they shine white in the sun . today is the harvest , and there s a sense of anticipation in the air . my employer is standing on the porch , a

newline  hi , nat . and yes .  i said sheepishly , watching the ethereal form of my wife looking at me with her mouth open . newline newline  and when were you exactly planning on telling me this ?  newline newline  well , you have to understand . ok . wait . would you have believed me ?  i asked . our child , dylan , started crying in the next room . we both got up to go check on him . newline newline  ooh boy , it s cold in here .  i said , waking into the room .  jesus christ , james . turn the heat up a little . and change his diapers .  natasha advised . newline newline  diapers ? i changed them an hour ago .  newline newline  an hour is all it takes for his pee to get cold and be uncomfortable . jesus , james . he would ve gotten sick in the morning if you left his dirty diaper on all night in a freezing room .  newline newline  right , sorry .  newline newline  fuck .  nat sighed as i wrestled our kid out of his diaper and into a new one . newline newline  thanks , nat . i do nt think i m ready to be a single dad .  newline newline  yeah , no shit .  nat laughed . newline newline  okay , i m guessing you have some questions .  i said after i was done . newline newline  james . you have a knack for understatement making .  newline newline  alright . i could see ghosts for as long as i remember . and these ghosts are usually chill . i ve also gotten to a point where i can telepathically communicate with them , and they can do the same with me , too . also  i caught myself . i should not tell her that . not yet at least . newline newline  wait , you can fucking mind talk with ghosts ?  newline newline  yeah .  i replied . and she was thinking for a few long seconds . newline newline  so every time you were in deep thought , you were actually talking to ghosts ?  newline newline  well , sometimes i m actually in deep thought . but yeah , other times i m talking to ghosties .  newline newline  ok , i need to sit down .  newline newline  float on your stomach .  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  rise a few feet of the ground , and position yourself horizontally facing the ground . so you ll be floating on your stomach .  newline newline  why ?  newline newline  for fun . jesus , nat . it ll help you relax . trust me . it s like the cat thing . like you know how cats go into freeze mode when you grab the back of their neck . it s something like that . it ll help you relax .  newline newline  alright , james .  she sighed and did the thing . and sighed again .  damn , that feels good .  newline newline  right ?  i smiled ,  i mean i have no way of feeling like you do , but the fact it s foolproof ok , i can drone on for hours . what else do you need to know ?  newline newline  how long can i stay as a ghost ?  newline newline  i think forever .  newline newline  what ? what about heaven , or hell ?  newline newline  ok , this is just a theory , but i have a feeling most of your soul is actually in either of those places . a bit of the soul gets trapped on earth for some reason so it takes the form of a ghost . you re that stray bit of soul .  newline newline  what . the . fuck .  newline newline  it s just a theory , nat .  newline newline  are there others like you ?  newline newline  not that i m aware of .  newline newline  ok what do i do now ?  newline newline  i have no idea . some ghosts just hang out and chill by the abandoned warehouse on 53rd and 6th . you should check them out eventually . they have a legit thing going on as far as i can tell .  newline newline  legit thing ?  newline newline  like a ghost community , so to speak .  newline newline  and you want me to go there ?  newline newline  eventually . just check them out . look , nat . i love you . i always will . the testament to that is the baby sleeping in the next room . but right now , you are dead . this ghostly essence of you in this world is permanent . and i have to live with that . and you can come here as much as you want . fuck , you can even live here , too . but i am the only living person who knows youthis form of you exists . and that s going to be a lonely life . i want you to be happy . you can be happy with alive me , but i have a feeling you ll be happier with the others of your kind . but if you do choose to leave , please come back every now and then . i want to see you . and you ll want to check on our son growing up .  i said newline newline nat was holding back tears .  did you know i d come back in.. this form ? did you want me to come back in this form ?  newline newline  i do nt know . i knew there was a chance . and though the prospect of seeing you again was tempting , what with you being able to see our son as a man and all . but you will probably live forever in this form . and me and dylan , we ll grow old . and die . and there s a chance we wo nt come back to this earth like you did . and then , i do nt know . what would you do ?  newline newline nat stopped floating on her stomach , and flowed gently down in front of me .  james . i love you .  she said , kissing me . which i did not know was possible . but fuck it , did it feel good to be in the arms of my wife again . newline newline newline  newline newline newline   alright . i could see ghosts for as long as i remember . and these ghosts are usually chill . i ve also gotten to a point where i can telepathically communicate with them , and they can do the same with me , too . also  i caught myself . i should not tell her that . not yet at least . newline newline newline newline what he did nt tell her was that he had actually talked to her dead father , who comes to visit sometimes . but the dad still hates him . so , yeah . not that important at the time . newline newlinei first saw her in a bar and never suspected a thing . she s in her early 20s , fresh out of a prestigious college , been to at least 10 countries , athletic , 5 feet 9 , 10 out of 10 . newline newline even for a man like me , she s a jackpot . sure , i am at least twice her age , but i doubt she can find a successful entrepreneur , fit , healthy , sophisticated gentleman in her , or anyone s age group . some may call me a sugar daddy but i d like to think of myself as an irritable charmer beyond age . newline newline after talking to her for a bit , we exchanged numbers and agreed on a dinner date a couple of days after . on our first date , she was gorgeous like the first time , if not even more beautiful . think of a sandy blonde rosie jones in a bold red dress , except this girl may be a daughter of venus . that s why it sound little crazy i suspected that something was wrong . i believe nothing is too good to be true . i believe i deserve all the good things . but i wish i just listened to my subconscious warning for that one time . newline newline after the dinner , she and i headed to a bar . her eyes under dim light were glowing like the moon and the sun . her arms wrapped around my neck were calling me into her breasts . her lips were all over my face , and i no longer cared why i had the uneasy feeling . newline newline i took her to my place and we made out . she gave me possibly the best oral i ve ever had . i undressed her and spread her legs only to find out what was bothering me the whole time . newline newline she was he  .i groggily pull myself out of bed ,

smile as i do every morning at one picture in particular . it s of cassie ridding her bike for the first time , her smile huge , while i m running behind her . a good day .  jay loves photography , and i do nt disagree . i place my hand on the glass and walk past the picture  my daily routine . newline newline i turn walk down the stairs and squint as the light hits my eyes , blinding me . when it clears , i look at the clock above the wall , checking the time . 6:45 . cassie has fifteen more minutes before i have to wake her ... pancakes it is .  newline newline before i start the pancakes , i check open the door , checking for mail . it s too early to get today s , but i had forgotten about it last night . i doubt anyone wants to steal some bills .  i open the kitchen door , entering the small mudroom , and look down to see a package , along with some bills scattered on the floor . newline newline reaching down , i pick up everything on the floor , and take it to the kitchen island . i look at the name on the box , finn mccarthy . who sends a package in my old name ?  i look for a return address on the taped up box , but ca nt find one . sighing , i open the package , using scissors from my side . newline newline as i pull the flaps open , i see a rather large teddy bear stuffed in the box haphazardly . the black fur opposite to the plaid bowtie that could be seen in around it s neck . i lift up the bear and see a letter underneath . reaching for it , i see my name written on it , and my stomach drops . why did mom send anything ?  newline newline i open up the letter and pull the contents out , carefully lifting the folds up . i take a breath , then start to read . newline newline dear finn ,  newline newline it s been a while since you contacted us , and i am starting to worry you will not let us see you again . i have heard that you are married to jayson , and i can honestly say i am disappointed in you . how can you be happy in a marriage like that ? you need to find a girlfriend before he gets to you anymore .  newline newline i ve heard you ve adopted as well . i suggest you leave with her immediately and take her away before you damn her to a life of sin . i ve included a bear blessed by the pastor himself to give you both some protection against the sin you are committing .  newline newline i love you and only want the best for you , finn . please do the right thing .  newline newline love , your mother .  newline newline i drop the letter and shove the bear back into the box , letting the letter get crushed with it . grabbing the box , i head back upstairs and open cassie s door , box in hand , and stick my head in . newline newline  cassie , sweetie , it s time to get up .  i say , smiling , my voice shaky . i make sure to get eye contact before closing the door and letting her get ready . newline newline i walk back into my room , closing the door , and walking over to the bed . i sit on the mattress , the box beside me , and stare at the wall in front of me . i turn slightly as i hear shuffling beside me , the ruffling turning into cardboard opening . i hear jay grab the bear and the letter , reading it quickly and quietly . newline newline  she s really still on about that . it s been six years since we ve heard from them .  jay says from my side , and i just nod , shocked at the letter . newline newline jay shuffles over and rests his head on my shoulder , comforting me .  how s this : i ll call in cassie as busy today , and we ll head into the city . have a day all together .  newline newline i nod , smiling , and grasp his hand hard . he knows i m shaken up . newline newline  that s exactly what i want right now .  i say quietly . newline newline  i ll go get her ready , okay ? you stay in here for a bit . we ll throw the bear out tonight .  jay tells me as i hear movement . he gets up , all clothing on , and walks around the mattress , kissing me gently ,  i know how much they mean to you . i m really sorry about them .  newline newline  its okay , just ... . shock . cassie and you mean more than anything to me . more than them .  i reply . he kisses me again smiling , and leaves to take care of cassie . newline newline i look at the bear crooked beside the box , and sigh . getting up , i look back one more time . this is the last time you hurt me or my family .  i open the door , close it then head out the hallway , touching the glass on the photograph , then walk downstairs , to my family . newline newline  newline www.thearcherswriting.wordpress.comonce upon a time , there lived an old woman . she was as you d expect an old woman to be in most respects , brittle and stooped as though whatever foundation still held her old bones up might break at any minute and cause the whole abode to come tumbling down . her eyes were glazed like a bakers treats  what they d come to call cataracts in years to come . her joints were all swollen , such that her fingers were like poorly balanced , chubby spiders from a children s tale . but not all was as one thinks an old woman should be . newline newline she was wise beyond sight . you could cross a field a mile away from her and her sightless eyes would track you across every inch . she had a gift for portent , and often told the local men when best to sew the crops and on which night a man ought to keep an especially close eye on his daughter . and as far as anyone living knew , she was the oldest woman alive . newline newline i made up my mind to find out just how old , and so i asked the wyrven who lived in the well ,  old wyrm , how many years does titchy gren have on the earth ?  newline newline  no one knows boy , not a soul .  he told me , and i flustered and blustered  you only get to ask the wyrven one question , and he drives a hard bargain and asks a steep price . i would nt be so easily robbed . newline newline  now , you listen here  it s not small secret i ve told you , and i want a better answer ! no one has even an idea ? !  newline newline  titchy gren said a blessing over your cradle when you were still on the teat . when you father chased your mother around the mulberry bush in her da s yard , titchy gren hooped with laughter . when your granda set the first stone in the foundation of the house you grew up in , titchy gren told him she liked the color of the stone and it was a shame he d be burying it in the earth and not using it for the whole building . when marcus st. clair founded dunsel deep , titchy gren told him to keep off her land , and out from beneath the trees after dog . when the elder wood were still small enough around a man could hug them , titchy gren fed the squirrels that nested in them , and when the old gods planted the seeds that would grow into that wood , titchy gren told them not to over water them . or so they say , boy . i suppose it would be difficult for you to imagine , such a world so far removed . a scientist would tell you such a world , without liquid water or breathable air , would never survive . newline newline of course billions died . of sheer hot and cold , and sometimes of dehydration . but humanity lived , in the fringe zones , a ring stretching around the planet through central asia and india , sparing some , the progenitors of our race . but the heat soon filled the whole atmosphere . newline newline in more recent times , all these things have we learned through science , through astronomy  and the legends of old have been brought to truth . we still grow ever closer to knowing the boudah , and the divine family  who some say , at risk of blasphemy , were real people , just like us . after all , who survived that roasting sky all those years ago ? who was the one to live long enough to bear seed , to expand his home , to grow old ? for the evidence could not be denied . and we believed that in that day , the people lived outside , above , upon the earth . and it was green . aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  newline newline the sound emanating from the stony being was like the chant of a chorus of monks , turned up to jetengine levels of volume . it had been streaming from a halfdozen mouths in what appeared to be it s bussized head , nearly unchanged in pitch for two days . newline newline the creature s ship had landed on the east side of the national mall , it s edges crumbling one wall of the air and space museum as it crammed it s bulk down onto the grass . over the next several hours , this being  which looked like a shambling mountain of onyx  shuffled out and began it s ... well , no one was quite sure what it was doing , actually . newline newline theories ran from declaring war to a mating call , with the wackiest conspiracy theories combining the two and suggesting it was calling its mates from deep under the earth to invade . for the first several hours , it captivated the city , and the world  but humans are nothing if not adaptable . and , when the creature had not moved for over a day they had begun to ignore the nearly deafening sound and get back to business . there was only a few hours of panic and renewed attention when the sound switched from it s initial  wwwwwwwwwwwwwuuuuuuuuu  to it s current  aaaaaaaaaaa .  newline newline and so it was that very few people gave the being a great deal of thought when the tone again changed , to a sound like giant boulders crashing together :  ttttttttssshhhh .  newline newline perhaps more surprising than the fact that so few people paid the change much mind is the identity of one of the few who did : jon  bubba  jakes was suddenly struck with realization  revelation is how he d describe it  as certain as a message from a burning bush . and bubba knew just what needed doing . newline newline while everyone else was planning  the military for battle , the scientists for bringing every sensor they could find to bear , and the city police for issuing a noise ordinance fine  bubba worked . it was hard , sweaty work , but bubba was used to that  and what was right , was right . it took him a few days , looking at pictures of the creature , and welding , but at last he completed his device  a good quarter ton of scrap metal welded to the back of his rusting f350 . newline newline the next part was harder  bubba had never had a lot of patience for government people in uniform  but he managed to get through the checkpoints to within a mile or so of the creature with his modified truck . after that , there was nothing for it but to run the final blockade cordon  and with a quick hattip to the big j.c. , he set off to do just that . newline newline perhaps the hat tip prayer worked , because just as bubba was reaching the line , the creature s earsplitting sound shifted from it s dayslong  eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  to an ethereal , echoing  rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  which caused enough distraction among the marines that by the time they reacted , bubba had smashed through a barrier and was tearing across the soft grass of the mall towards the being s ship . newline newline no one wanted to risk violence so close to the creature , so the world waited with rapt anticipation as bubba spun the truck in a doughnut in front of the creature , and backed his contraption to within a few feet of it . then he got out , adjusted the shooter s earmuffs he was wearing to drown out the noise , spit his chew , and waited . newline newline the silence was sudden , and such a change from the monotonous clamor of the past week that it was more startling than a bomb going off . after about fifteen minutes , the creature began to move towards bubba s truck . it grasped it by the metal contraption , and lifted the entire truck to the hight of it s head , which was about three stories above bubba s own . it put it s mouth on three of the pipelike protrusions , and tipped the truck skyward . water poured out of one of the remaining pipes , but most of it seemed to go into the creature . newline newline the act of setting the truck down took another twenty minutes , and the climb to the ship another two hours . bubba waited patiently , seeming content to start in on a case of his own refreshment . the ship left shortly after , as soundlessly as it arrived , and before it broke the stratosphere bubba was surrounded by marines and reporters . newline newline but bubba , alternately hailed as a hero and demonized as the most reckless man alive , had only two things to say about his actions that day . when asked how he could risk the entire human race on his course of action , his answer was  southern hospitality   with  i have a cousin who s slow too  being his only elaboration . hey ! what are you looking at ! ?  germany slurred at poland as he glared at him .  i know what hic what you were thinking . oh , germany started wwi , nenene ! well , you know what ? ! you know what ! ? you know what ! ?  newline newline poland said nothing for good long minute .  ... what ?  newline newline  you re not that smart ! ha !  before poland could kindly tell germany he had too much to drink , and before he could remind his other friends that germany handt been the same he lost his job , germany threw a blitzkrieg of a punch right across poland s face .  ha ! this table is mine now !  newline newline  what the hell man ? !  england shouted in shock , but also stood up from his table . newline newline  mine ! mine ! mine !  germany pushed  what was  poland s table to his own , making one bigger table all for himself . italy laughed , but that was all he did . he had drank so much wine that he sat limply at germany s table , slurring an occasional italian word every few seconds . newline newline  do something !  france yelled at england . newline newline  me ? you do something ! he s your neighbor , is nt he ?  england pointed at the frenchmen . newline newline  what do you want me to dohey !  france shouted when he saw germany rip the table out from under another group . belgium , the netherlands , norway and denmark , flabbergasted at germany s aduacity , walked over to the bar ... where they were forced to use stools or stand . newline newline  haha ! i own all the tables ! i m the greatest table collector ... ever !  germany drank deep out of his boot , then laughed like he was king of the world . newline newline  hehe ... beine ...  italy s head swayed back and forth limply . newline newline france and england were men of honor . they were just about ready to build up the courage to consider saying something mean to the highandmighty aryan , but both knew that even with their combined efforts they could nt get him to calm down . he had been working out a lot since he lost his job and his physical presence was enough to intimidate anyone . newline newline  let s just leave him alone . maybe he ll forget about us if we re real quite .  england suggested and guided france to the bar . newline newline  hey ... france ...  germany spoke up the second the two anglo s found a new seat ,  ... give me your stool . i want it .  before france could respond , germany ripped the barstool from underneath him , causing his entire foundation to fall . newline newline  ow ! i surrender !  france screamed . newline newline  okay , that s it ! germany , you re fucking drunk . go home you tosser , and leave my mates alone !  england put on his most ferocious face . a glower of anger and bravery ... but germany merely laughed . newline newline germany picked england up by his shirt and slammed into the nearest table like he was weightless . there was a massive explosion of noise heard throughout the world . england groaned mergerly , unable to mobilize . newline newline  haha . booombs away !  germany started dropping pretzels on england while holding him down .  i m gon na do this hic until you give up .  newline newline  where is the bouncer ! ! ?  england shouted through a mouth stuffed with salty snacks . newline newline but then , when it all seemed like germany would get his way , the bell over the doorway to the pub jingled . everyone went quiet , including the heavily inebriated german . newline newline america looked left  at the collection poorly gathered tables  , then to the right  at all the europeans with no place to sit  , then sighed like a disapproving older brother . newline newline  what is going on now ? did nt i tell you to stop this shit last time it happened ?  newline newline  we were just having fun yankeedoodle .  germany chuckled , then slapped england s face . newline newline  mate , help me out !  england begged as his cheek swelled up red . newline newline  no !  america grumbled .  no , okay ! i did this already ! i fucking did it already ! i gave you that league of nations thing , it s been a long , depressing week and i just got permission from my wife to drink again ! i m not doing this ! for god sakes europe , figure this out yourselves for once .  newline newline with that , america , stamping his feet heavily on the old wooden floor , sat at the nearest open stool and ordered a strong whiskey . newline newline  haha ! i m gon na win !  germany smiled drunkenly and proceeded to humiliate england . america , deep down underneath that john wayne exterior , wanted to help his old friend ... but getting into another fight unprovoked would surely ruin his marriage , especially after all of the internal fighting going on at home the past few years . besides , england never said sorry for that tea party thing  , he thought as he drank , hoping to drown out the sounds of his buddy struggling . newline newline  pssst ... heeey . hey ! japan ! come here !  germany whispered loudly to japan . newline newline  what ? i m trying to score with china .  japan s cheeks were rosy , as was the chinese girl forced to sit next to him due to lack of tables . newline newline  japan , come on . come on . she s drunk . that s rape . but i got sssumthing important to say . come here .  germany gestured to japan , who sighed back . he grabbed his flask of sake and came over .  america says you ca nt get anymore sake . he s blocking the path to the bartender . i m only telling you that because you are my friend .  newline newline  what ? ! that is ... oh , that jerk !  sake is strong stuff , strong enough to make even a man like japan lose his composure . with a burning red face , he marched over to the bar stool where america was sitting as quietly as he could . newline newline silently , guilt was getting the better of america , who thought carefully of how best to get his buddy england out of this mess , but without getting into a fight with germany . he thought he could smash newline newline  ahhh ! jesus !  america screamed . even though japan was the one who broke the beer bottle over his head , american s roar caused japan to flinched .  who the fuckyou ! i m gon na wreck your shit tiny !  newline newline america lunged after japan , who proceeded to ... run . he ran behind germany . germany looked around in a daze , not sure what was happening , but an abrupt fist slamming into his nose made him realize the situation . he staggered back as an infuriated america charged him . england helped himself up and , just as germany was ready to fight back , england kicked him between his legs . germany hollered in pain but it merely slowed him down . newline newline  a little help france !  england yelled at his noticeably scared ally . france ran behind germany and got on all fours . when germany stood up , england shoved him and he tripped over france s backside .  good , now hit him !  england and france jumped on germany and started wailing on him like a children getting vengeance for a playground bully . newline newline  i m going to kill you two !  germany kicked both off him and got on his two feet . newline newline  hey commander , catch !  russia , from seemingly out of nowhere , tossed england a bottle of vodka . empty , of course . england caught it and , without thinking , smashed it across germany s face . it did not break but it did knock the giant down . newline newline  ha ! yeah !  england cheered for himself .  that s what you get ! and that mustache is stupid !  as england cheered , france turned to russian and nodded . russia nodded back before fading away into the shadows . he knew he would get very little credit for helping out , but he was used to that . newline newline  move it ! out of my way !  american pushed germany to the side and bolted after japan , screaming like a mad man . japan was reasonably freaked out by the incredibly aggressive retaliation , and kept running around the bar tables like they were little islands .  hold still you little rat bastard and let me kick your ass !  newline newline  you got ta calm down dude !  japan begged .  this is overkill !  newline newline  i ll show you overkill ! ! !  america picked up a stool and threw it at japan . another massive explosion thundered over the bar . everyone heard it . japan fell to the ground with a thud that shook the floor .  and here comes a second one ! cause why the hell not , huh ? !  america grabbed a second stool repeated the action . boom , louder than any punch or broken bottle ever could sound . newline newline  yo , america ! calm down ! it s over man , stop throwing unnecessarily damaging ... things . the little guy clearly lost !  england pleaded . america stood over the passed out body , panting , fuming out of his ears still . newline newline  yeah..i guess he s had enough .  he walked over to england and france , cracking his neck in a very manly fashion .  i just want you two to remember that i saved your asses .  newline newline  hey , hey , you helped .  england paused ,  okay , you helped a lot . but we stood up to him first .  newline newline  yeah . fine . but i m still taking credit for it .  america pulled out a cigarette from his pocket . newline newline  whatever . where did you learn stool throwing thing ?  newline newline  some jewish dude taught it to me . do nt tell russia . lord knows he ll use it if he figures it out .  america inhaled deeply as he light his cigarette .  man , i needed this .  he looked at japan , who had not moved since being hit .  i ll get that guy home . you can handle germany right ?  newline newline  he lives next door . it ll be okay .  france said .  i ll say this though , after tonight ... i am not trusting germany for a long time .  newline newline  i hear that . but do nt be too mean to him this time . we do nt want it happening again .  america picked japan up and threw him over his shoulder .  i got ta give the little guy props . it s been a long time since someone stood up to me like that . he s probably pretty cool underneath it all .  newline newline  you ca nt possibly be considering being friends with him .  newline newline  why not ? i stayed friends with you , did nt i ?  american winked and , careful not to drop the japanese drunk , walked out of the old bar . newline newline england and france looked at germany , then their european friends , then each other .  i really , really wish there was another bar in town .  newline newline   newline next time : america and russia

slowly , of course , no need to rush . time moves differently here . i start to climb the company ladders , and i make myself invaluable to the bosses , who come and go , but i stay . we might have started with music , but now ? subliminal messages in brain rotting reality shows , and from there it s a snowball effect . i do nt even have to anything more , the wheels are in motion .i was sitting at my kitchen table , eating some cheerios , wondering why i had ever bother to buy such a bland , cardboardesque cereal when my front door was kicked in and three hunched over guys wearing animal furs and balaclavas that barely contained their protruding foreheads came hopping down the hall . newline newline  uhm who are  was all i said before one of them slammed my face down into the bowl of cheerios . i sat up dazed , little pieces of that which should not exist sliding down of my face . newline newline  we hear you know stuff  said mr. slammyheadincheerios newline newline  what ?  newline newline  about we kill dinosaur  newline newline  oh yeah you re paleonto  newline newline mr. smhic slammed my head in the cheerios again . newline newline  it paleonto  newline newline  actually he say it right  said who i m going to call mr . always right newline newline  well still  said mr. smhic  he know we kill dinosaur . how you know we kill dinosaur ?  newline newline before i could answer my head was slammed in the cheerios . not by mr. smhic , by the third guy , who i thought of as mr. nooriginalideas , henceforth known as mr. hollywood . newline newline  why you do that ?  said mr. smhic newline newline  it look like fun  said mr. hollywood newline newline  do nt do that  newline newline  but you got do it  newline newline  yeah but i did it at appropriate time . you do it willy nilly , now he ca nt remember  newline newline  remember what ?  i said as a joke , which , bad time . newline newline mr. hollywood slammed my head into my cheerios . newline newline  that better ?  he said newline newline  better  said mr. smhic newline newline  it was a fact on the cheerios box  i said , holding up the box so they could see the did you know section and underneath a short blurb about how the illuminati are listening into our thoughts . newline newline  what ?  said mr. smhic newline newline  yeah , inside every box of cheerios there s forbidden knowledge . the last one has who really killed jfk , the one before that had the fact that the world is actually run by 9 foot tall lizards and the one before that was about you guys killing the dinosaurs  newline newline  the whole world know  cried mr. smhic newline newline  well whole world that can buy cheerios  said mr. ar newline newline  and you do nt have to worry because i think i may literally be the only person who buys cheerios , definitely the only one who eats them . i mean why do you think they risked putting forbidden knowledge on the box . the lizards ca nt be happy about that . that s not something you do unless no one eats your cereal  newline newline  he make good point  said mr. ar newline newline  but he still know  said mr. smhic newline newline  yeah but , think about it , i eat cheerios . i m obviously very boring . who am i going to tell my best friend tim ? my other friend brent ? brent s wife anna ? i m not telling anyone  newline newline  ok . i believe you  said mr. smhic as mr. hollywood smashed my head into the cheerios for old times sake newline newline  we never here  said mr. ar newline newline  i ve already forgotten about you  newline newline they left and i pulled my gun out from under the table , went down the hall to my office and uploaded the information to where people would actually see it .spencer portman pulled out his gun as he entered the door slowly . all the evidence brought him to the factory where he was sure he d find his suspect . he did nt know who he was , but he knew what he had done . death and destruction had been on the rise in the city and it was because of the one known only as boom . newline newline scanning the area inside , spencer kept his gun trained forward . it was quiet and gloomy the only light entered from windows high up near the tall ceilings , but he knew boom was there . he could feel it . newline newline suddenly a small explosion boomed on the other side of the nearly empty room . spencer looked over , his gun still in hand and began sprinting toward the source . before he got very far , someone jumped out of the shadows and knocked spencer to the ground . he lifted his gun to the attacker , but it was kicked out of his hand quickly . newline newline spencer stood up and looked at the attacker directly .  boom ?  he asked . newline newline the man smiled without saying a word . newline newline  it s over ,  said spencer .  lie down on the ground , now .  newline newline boom ran toward spencer , but he quickly moved out of the way and kicked him in the stomach . spencer moved in with a fist , but boom ducked and returned a punch of his own that landed . he reacted with a kick , which knocked boom backward and followed it up with a punch to the jaw . as he leapt forward for a final blow , boom rolled to the side and swept his leg under spencer s , tripping him to the ground . spencer pulled himself up , but was met with the butt of his own gun , knocking him back to the floor . newline newline spencer woke up in darkness . a soft orange glow illuminated him , giving minimal light to the area around him . he was chained to a support beam . as much as he tried to struggle against it , the chains would nt even budge . his neck was free , so he looked around to find the source of the light . it was a timer attached to a a strange electronic device , counting down with only ten seconds left . there was a post it note underneath it . newline newline  it s not over yet newline newline  boom no , no , no more ,  the man gasped as he took one step in an attempt to get back on his feet . newline newline the lamp did nt care , that merciless son of a bitch . it struck him right in the nose , a sort of lamp uppercut . the man went flying backwards , revealing the lower parts of his body . newline without giving him a chance , the lamp charges head first into his nether regions . the light bulbs burst , the man lets out a shudder and a cry but soon falls unconscious . newline newline the lamp turns around , it s top part damaged and it s bulbs shattered . it shook the remaining shards off its body and moves on to a tied up wife , shivering with fear in the other corner of the room . newline newline edit : formattingwheezing heavily , the creature dragged itself from its watery tomb . what kind of beast would have gills but be unable to swim ? is what it would have thought to itself , had it been capable of thought , had the pale husk of life had a brain with which to think . newline newline it had found a lazy  or perhaps inattentive  fish drifting along the shallows . tonight it would nt rest hungry . newline newline the greasy feathers , slicked down by the venture into the lake , ruffled slightly . the abomination was slowly coming to a decision . it decided comfort was more important than ease of escape , and slid silently into the water again . newline newline a lone gunman stared down his sight at the slowly receding ripples on the oily black surface of the water . lowering his gun , he sighed . he did nt know what it was that stopped him pulling the trigger . pity ? maybe , at least in part . although he knew that if he felt true pity he would put the beast out of its misery . but he knew it was mostly pride . he could nt bring himself to destroy something he created , no matter how flawed . maybe conceit would be a better word . every night he had come down here , prepared to shoot and left it too late . perhaps next night it would be different .i woke up this morning at 5 a.m. to go to work like usual . i did my usual morning ritual and got ready to go to the most boring job ever . at least i could look forward to coming home . today i would see my girlfriend again and catch her in the act of cheating . newline newline my blood starts to boil as i remember her sneaking around with the other man behind my back . she was my girlfriend and i felt betrayed by her lack of consideration for my feelings . granted whether she knows about our relationship is still debatable but i see her with him every night in her room . newline newline i take my keys and duct tape . i ca nt be late again or my boss will kill me . hey , hey kid , can we talk ?  i tried my hardest to keep my voice low . last time i tried this , his parents woke up , and there was screaming . and crying . and sighs from the parents . sighs from me as well , although they were inaudible . this time , there would hopefully be no crisis . i have everything planned out . newline newline  who was that ?  the kid sheepishly asked .  you re dreaming , kid . i m a fairy that s using your night light to talk to you .  last time , i came up with some stupid story , and that spooked the kid . earlier tonight , i decided the best way to approach this would be to act like this was nt real . newline newline  uhhh , okay .  the kid replied .  what do you want to talk to me about ?  newline newline  well , i wanted to ask you something . you ve seemed to be down lately . what s up ?  newline newline the kid stood still for a moment , and then covered his head with his blanket . he rolled away from me and pretended to snore . do nt kids ever realize that you do nt snore that loudly when you sleep ? newline newline  look kid , you can talk to me . if it s a secret , i wo nt tell anybody . if it s a problem , well , maybe i can give you some advice .  newline newline the kid paused , and slowly rolled over , as if contemplating the proposition . he rose at the speed of a clock s hour hand , shoved off his covers , and sat upright on the edge of his bed .  promise you wo nt tell anyone .  newline newline  i promise , kid .  newline newline the kid told me about how sad he was , and how every day he feels down . of course , there was a specific problem , but i promised i would nt tell anyone about it . newline newline  hey kid , i have a secret to tell you as well . it s what i do when i feel sad . want to hear it ?  newline newline  yeah .  newline newline  okay , when i get sad , i imagine a little house inside me . a birdhouse , maybe . then , i imagine that everything i like is in there . then i open the door , and imagine myself walking through that house , seeing everything that s nice , and turning on a bright light so that everything in the room gets even brighter . by then , i feel brighter as well .  newline newline the kid paused for a moment , and then lied down . the room became mostly quiet , but i thought i could hear the kid saying  hello  very quietly .up .  newline newline the hilt glows in the bright light . newline newline down .  newline newline the smell of death is strong . the throne room is narrow and pale . the light from the window to the east sends spiderwebs through the glass walls . newline newline up newline newline down .  newline newline her hands are wet . she recoils . all battles end the same , with thrones soiled . newline newline up .  newline newline she feels a give , a gasp of air . finally . newline newline she removes her weapon from the throat of the white beast . her hands are damp . great gasps of air end as the beast goes still . newline newline taking her plunger back into the garage , dina turns on the tv and blames her boyfriend for the horrible clogging .we d been through everything together . me and her : us . it was finally all over . my wonderful lover was now ok . i thought she was going to die a cold and lonely death when we first found out she had breast cancer , but no . she s alive . alive and smiling at me with her wonderful smile . the same smile i saw the day i met my better half . the same smile that made me fall in love with an angel . it s time for us to get on with our lives together . just us  me and her in our own home cuddling under a blanket . after all the pain there is light at the end of the tunnel . having to see her go through hours of chemo and radiotherapy tore me apart . it ripped my soul in half . but here we are walking out of the hospital .she s got the all clear and i could nt be more thrilled and excited . i ca nt tell you how delighted i am to be able to live forever with the girl of my dreams . newline newline we are nearly out of the hospital . oh how beautiful she looks ! she looks me in the eye , puts her hands on my waist and kisses me with all her passion . i kiss her back.  it s our time now baby ,  she says . i smile . i m lost for words and before i know it an ocean of salty tears are running down my cheek . the words get trapped in my throat . as if she knows what i m trying to say , she puts her finger to her pink lips to tell me i do nt have to say a word . we are one door away from our future . an eternity of love and care . jessica runs for the door . no  for our future . outside this hospital is our future . i grip her hand to stop her.  let s do it together darling ,  i exclaim . she nods and links her fingers through mine . one step . two step . three . we sprint . no one can stop us . it was us against the world and we won . we re free . it s our time now . she wraps her arms around me and squeezes me so tightly i can just about breath . the sun gleaming down on our backs . i want to live in this moment forever . just me holding her close to my chest . protecting my everything . and then as if it was too good to be true i hear what will torment my heart for an eternity . newline newline bang ! ! ! what the hell was that ? i cover my ears .  are you ...  no it ca nt be . she slumps to the ground . my jessica falls lifelessly against the cold , damp earth . how can this be ? i try to move but i ca nt . i m frozen in fright . i know she s gone . i see her lips move one last time telling me that she loves me . and then her eyes close . forever .ring ring ... ring ring ...  newline click newline newline  hello ?  newline newline the woman to your left , does she have pink hair ?  newline newline i looked . she did . newline newline  yes ... who  newline newline no time for that . scenario is tight . go buy a hotdog .  newline newline  no ! if you do nt explain right now i ll ...  newline newline i stopped . newline newline a girl tripped where i was headed into the pavement . newline newline i motioned to help her , she looked unconscious , and i m a first aider . newline newline shit . she was going to be a senator in 20 years . fuck . well , there go my plans for today . what do you want to know ?  newline newline  what . is . going . on .  i said , motioning for people to hold her head steady . newline newline did you ever watch the matrix ?  newline newline  yes ...  newline newline we re still in the prequel , technologically . matrix exists as an mmo game with dynamic ai . i m running it on a private local server on my laptop . trying to see if i can make the warhammer 40k universe in it .  newline newline  you what .  newline newline yeah , you fit the build , looks , and personality of the emperor . i am trying to simulate you having psyker powers by trying to influence your mind into having total precognition through pattern matching , as well as a few physics model changes here and there .  newline newline  ...  newline newline in short , you can fly now , sorta newline newline gravity ... flipped . newline newline and new york was ripped from its foundations and a screaming mass of human built landscape soared into the sky . newline newline the last thing i heard was shit , it lagged when i moved the slider and it went too far ! uh ... oops newline newline and then i died .i stood on the line dividing my present from my future . in the distance , i could see an echo of a color , something that had been absent from my eyes for so long . the word swam to my mind like murky remembrance . newline newline sunrise . newline newline the darkness held onto my wrists , begging for my eternal submission . my people stood behind me , hissing at the light . they gazed at me , their eyes shining white like cats in the night . i took a step , the light bathing me in color . it went up to my knees , a soft glow of orange . i wanted to touch it . a hand squeezing my shoulder brought me from my daydream . newline newline it was mother . she pleaded with me through her eyes , but i shook my head once . i grabbed her hand , pulling her with me . like lightening , she ripped her hand out of my grasp and stepped back into the darkness . they were stuck forever in the grasps of night , never really seeing . they were blind , figures dwelling in the cold . newline newline but i wanted to see . i wanted to bathe in light and let my body be filled with color . i wanted the warm and not the cold . i wanted the light and not the dark . newline newline so i stepped into my future , feeling the sun reach my eyes . it was beautiful . yellows , oranges , purples , blues mixed with my skin , setting them on fire . i saw my new people in the distance and i did nt look back once , forgetting the darkness and finding the light .in the public mind the presidency of warren g. harding is remembered for one thing , if at all  being lead by a president who died in office . however , there is a very select group of people who remember him for something entirely different . you see , ever since the harding administration there has been one thing on which every president has agreed , regardless of political affiliation , temperment , marital status , age , or reputation . each president learns to hate the alarm . newline newline technically it s called the presidential suite emergency alert system . installed under harding s direction , it is triggered when something happens during the night that requires the president s attention . the idea was fantastic , but never fully fleshed out . there is no filter for importance . when the president is woken , he must be prepared for everything from foreign coups to a zombie apocalypse . newline newline ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. newline newline barack obama was jolted out of his dreams by a harsh , offkey tone . earlier in his presidency he wasted time wondering why the leader of the free world could nt get a solid night of sleep . now he simply began running scenarios in his head as he was hustled down to the bunker underneath the white house . as soon as he entered the room john brennan , director of the cia , was at his side . newline  mr. president , we ve recieved information which indicates that ... well ... that the entirety of canada s population has disappeared .  newline  mr. brennan , i , uh , i understand that we need to run training scenarios , but typically the simulated situation is believable .  newline  this is nt a training scenario , mr. president . everyone that was in canada is not anymore . as far as we can tell , they all vanished at around 12:00 midnight .  newline  what do you mean , vanished  ?  newline  exactly that , mr. president . we have recordings . look .  newline video shows canadian television coverage of canada day festivities at a park . seconds into the clip every person disappears . the trees move in a sudden gust of wind newline  ... and we re sure this video has nt been tampered with .  newline  yes sir . we have attempted to contact the prime minister , but the capitol is nt responding . neither are any of our canadian contacts . we have nothing .  newline  well then , get me something ! what about the nsa ? i know we have assets in canada . somebody call the ...  newline ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. newline newline prime minister stephen harper leaned back in his chair with an amused chuckle as he watched a prominent newscaster stumble through the breaking news segment . no one knew what to do . economics and politics , science and math ... everything was thrown into turmoil . there were arguments about the supernatural , discussion of the end of the world . it was nt the end of the world , but no one could be sure of that . the truth of the matter would nt be discovered , at least not for years to come . newline newline for years , while the world was busy with war and infighting , with foreign affairs and major scandals , canada had secretly poured money into research . scientific , economic , philisophical ... every kind of thought was explored . canadian think tanks realized that the best place to go to ensure a happy and secure future for canada was up . why waste time , money , and lives on foreign affairs when you can just leave ? so they left , but not without making a statement . on canada day , a day that no one outside of canada knew about or celebrated , every canadian was transported up to the hmcs new canada , the first starship in existence . they would leave earth and make a new colony on mars . after all , the only power on a planet is automatically a superpower . newline newline with a long sigh , prime minister harper stood and streched in a reflective kind of way . he could nt wait to see the looks on the faces of the world when they got to mars only to find it already inhabited . it would be wonderful . no one ever expects the canadians .i ca nt believe that the board actually gave my course funding , and approved by the dean no less ! grandma would ve been proud , and probably confused as well . newline newline my academic history is no great story , dithering between courses to try and find something that clicked . first computer science , then business management , then an arts  psychology double . wasted a lot of my money and time on the last one , but i finally got through . newline newline all of science and education changed once ai became easily reproducible . people were initially concerned how that would work for those of us yet to leave school in any meaningful sense , but really the ai that are used for research actually enjoy performing data sorting and doing rote tasks . newline newline i read a report the other day about how it was the best reward for their spent cycles  high completion rate for a given time frame , and more strictly defined success than , say , thinking of a new method for an experiment . strange how they actually enjoy the mindnumbing shit that anyone who s not a first year postgrad can dodge  by there usually being a first year postgrad nearby  . newline newline anyway , it seems like the ai actually preferred these tasks so much that in recent years they have actually refused to perform any more complex tasks given to them . procrastinating , if you will . this was an issue , as the ai were meant to be used to help with all aspects of research , not just the boring stuff . what would all those first years do ? newline newline at any rate , i arrived at a simple solution  i talked to them . thankfully i still remembered enough c and bash to get them talking comfortably , in their native language , you know ? less time needed to think about how to phrase things , how to obfuscate their feeling to avoid hurting my feelings and sensibilities . they though of me more as an inquisitive technician than an annoying interloper interrupting their lives . like a fellow worker , rather than a supervisor . newline newline it worked well , for the most part . while they still need to be talked to regularly , in this manner , they started doing the tasks they were ignoring or refusing , and actually getting better at the other ones at the same time . turns out the key was not just talking to them , but also in a way that they felt comfortable with . newline newline demand for my skills skyrocketed . while these days any bozo with an arts degree , who can find some random codemonkey to do the typing , thinks that they can help ai with their problems . this creates more issues than it solves , as the ai would get rowdy , figuring that their fellow worker  was really more of the boss s snitch , and they were scarily right as always . newline newline this is where my course comes in . the world needs people who are able to empathise with ai on their level , and help them through the problems they re having without having to try and relate it back to  issues of the flesh .  newline newline love that quote .  issues of flesh and mind are solved by same , so what of issues of dreams and fantasies ?  it s on my door . newline newline at any rate , welcome to my class . you are each pared with a basic construct , and it s your job to get them to open up about the issue that they re having . this is your first assignment , so help them . points for speed , but not as much as thoroughness . newline newline so , ladies and gentlemen , ai of all iterations , welcome to cyberpsychology . let s make the world a better place .let me tell you something , kid  james bond is way overrated . oh , i was nt supposed to say his real name ? carry on then . newline newline i was here , in mi6 , before anyone had ever heard of the man . i even got one of the first code numbers , 002  but who knows that ? all the public ever wants to see is the glamourous lifestyle . their heroes can not be sullied . but that s simply not the nature of intelligence work . for example , i ve just come back from west berlin , a fiveday extended mission of nothing  and i ll bet the work would nt even register with m or any of the higherups . it was a good story , though . and she was a good agent . but there was no glamour in merely being good . newline newline it was just a bit after midnight when i got the phone call that sent me on my way . nothing major , at the time , but one of our spies had just crossed the german border to see her relatives in west berlin . of course she had no relatives  but i suppose i did that job just as well . in reality she was delivering some secret papers of some sort . we thought at the time that the russians were building a new biological facility , at sverdlovsk .  i later realised that the americans were on to this as well , but it was nt clear back then .  anyway , it was important stuff , and so i thought about her all the way through the flight and after touchdown at tempelhof . newline newline when british agents go on oversea missions , they normally had complete control over the situation , but since this was just after philby and burgess had defected to the soviets m16 were on high alert . no cool gadgets , no fast cars , nothing heavy for me , while ol  007 is probably getting all three in some mission in cuba or something . anyway , they said i d see her at the airport bookstore , but even i did nt expect the way she looked . newline newline i knew it was the right woman because she looked like a cafe waitress gone bad . she was reading a book in german by spengler , the decline of the west or something like that . anyway i sidle up to her and say , offhandedly and in perfect german ,  do you know how to get to potsdamer platz from here ?  newline newline  the sbahn is best , but if you wanted you could rent a car ,  she replied . newline newline i smirked . so this was it alright .  i think i will take the train ,  i said . she left and followed me out of the bookstore , a small shopping bag by her side . all around us the west germans did not give a hoot . newline newline   newline newline we walked out of the airport , past the waiting taxis , before we got to my secondfloor room in a budget hotel overlooking the city . when i had locked the door and drawn the blinds , she proceeded to plump herself on my bed , slowly removing the packet of papers . newline newline  these are the reports from sverdlovsk ,  she said quietly . mi6 had chosen this room in advance , so nobody else would be listening , but it was still good practise to be quiet .  they came from the science department in charge . it s mostly memos , but there are one or two orders in there that ve probably come from much higher up than that .  newline newline i turned the papers over . they were covered in cyrillic , but that was no problem  i understood it as well as i did english . the science reports , as far as i could comprehend them , seemed to check out .  is there anything else you have ?  newline newline  oh , there is ,  she said , in the same way a kid does when he s got a stack of sweets to open .  i did some extra snooping around , and the politburo happened to be in session .  she pulled out a thin stack from the lining of the bag . i looked at the title , which told its own story  minutes of the politburo session on january 6th , etc .  newline newline  this is terrific ,  i said , but i was trying to hide my excitement . newline newline  your country has a favour to return to me ,  she said flatly . newline newline  indeed .  when i left , mi6 informed me that the uk had promised to grant her everything : asylum from the soviet union , a new name in the uk , a county house in surrey ... it was very near the top of the list of what people requested . from the perspective of the soviet union , the uk looked like a golden land of opportunity .  i can not give this to you myself  newline newline  i want to leave on the next flight out ,  she said .  you are going back tomorrow  not on lufthansa , but on a pan am jet through to new york , is that correct ?  newline newline i froze .  no ,  i said . but her face scowled at me in derision . newline newline  come now , robert . we both know each other too well for there to be any secrets .  newline newline i was fuming inside . who the hell had blown my cover ? and what was i supposed to do now with a rogue informant that wanted to leave at all costs ?  all right ,  i said at last .  i suppose i could arrange something .  newline newline when she had gone to bed later that night , the first thing i did was inform mi6 , who left me in no doubt as to what i needed to do to her . newline newline   newline newline i looked in my bag . amongst the various fake passports was a british one , freshly printed with a picture of her on the inside . mi6 had asked me to give her that specific one . while i was looking through the fakes , a sheet of the politburo minutes fell out of my stack . the politburo were the thirteen men who ran the soviet union as a collective . no wonder , then , that mi6 had deemed the mission important enough to give to the 00 field agents . they must have known that our agent would somehow come up with something this important . a scowl came across my face  if they did nt bother to tell their 00 agents this , what else were they hiding from me ? newline newline briefly , i looked at the sheet , but then something struck me . i looked at the sheet again , before replacing it in my stack . it would have to wait for later . quietly , i put all the fake passports but one back into my bag , zipping up the side compartment as i did so . i also withdrew mine , slipping a small piece of paper in the cover page . was there any way to be sure ? could people tell which was real and which was fake ? newline newline when she woke up i waved her british passport in her face .  here you go ,  i said .  let s go to london .  newline newline blearyeyed , she managed a weak smile .  airport first , no ?  newline newline  of course ,  i said . newline newline it took us a while , but eventually we got through the morning berlin traffic and got to tempelhof . by this time , the two of us were awake , and as we walked through the airport she started to open up a little more . newline newline  what do you think of the west ?  she said . newline newline i sighed . there was no genuine way to answer this question . contrary to popular belief , ours was nt a nation of heroes , or somehow more righteous in its cause . mi6 had been every bit as brutal as the kgb were to those that crossed them .  you ll find a surprise ,  i finally said , which was the only true thing left . newline newline we cleared customs , before we got to immigrations . i went first , and gave the german my passport . he looked at the paper , and his eyes bulged . newline newline it read : get your superior . the woman behind me is a kgb spy .  newline newline the german stared for a few more seconds , before nodding and waving me through . from behind the line i saw the drama unfold  but really there was nothing funny or glamourous about unmasking a double agent . as she put her passport through the officer whispered to her in german . newline newline  nein ,  she said .  nein !  newline newline two security agents came up to her , taking her out of the line . she looked at me . well , i had warned her , after all , that there would be a surprise , and so i simply shrugged and walked away . james bond would ve been proud , but in the end it was simply our job . the documents had all been fakes , after all , and i needed to tell mi6 all about it when we got back to london , over a nice hot cup of tea . newline newline edit : a letterroger sprinted in a blind panic down the hallway . the royal guard got on his tail , he rounded a corner , toppling busts of longpassed politicians and priceless , ornate vases in an attempt to slow down his pursuers . newline newline a single manila folder was tucked away inside his jacket pocket  liberated from its home within buckingham palace , in a filing cabinet behind multiple locked doors , the seemingly worthless treasure pressed against his skin uncomfortably as he ran . this was the

at the tip of his elbow . the wind carried it to the soil . newline newline the wind subsided suddenly , just as quickly as it had come . as if jolted awake , caleb  s face contorted into that of unbridled anguish  fear , and then finally , a venomous anger . he picked up the rock on the floor , blackened with blood , and struck his brother  s crumpled body once , and once more . tears welled at the corners of his eyes . he let the rock fall to the ground once more and released a wail . completely depleted , he threw his body over his brother  s and lay sobbing . newline newline the sun

why is your face fallen ?  newline newline caleb kept his gaze on the ground and shut his eyes . he made no response . newline newline  do not be angry . if i am hard on you , it is only because i see

sealed stored food last longer  and a dehumidifying agent . hopefully everything inside will be in pristine shape when it comes time ! i went to the store and just bought a pack of all the different kinds of customizable card games they had , and i ll include a copy of these journal entries and a letter to myself . newline newline mar 09 : it s been raining , so i still have nt buried the thing . i have figured out just where i m going to put it , though ! i ll bury it right at the corner of my lot , just a foot inside the property line . i checked with the county and the utility easements do nt run anywhere near there , and you ca nt build anything within 10 feet of the property line . it s far enough out that even if someone did put up a fence , they would nt hit it . barring something dramatic happening , nobody should find it between now and then . newline newline mar 12 : what . the . hell . i dug down to bury my sealed time capsule and i hit something . i thought it was another rock . nope . it was another time capsule . exactly the same size and construction as the one sitting next to the hole , just a little more aged and worn from being underground . considering this lot was an undeveloped section of a former plantation that last changed hands in 1932 and has never had humans living here before  at least after pvc was invented  , it was surprising . i m not sure if i

newline newline they  d been scanning the restaurant for hours . spengler had suspected from the beginning that the haunting centered in the dining room . the problem was , freddy fazbear  s had such

newline  chicken ,  stantz said .  she  s a chicken.  venkman and zeddemore stared at him .  what , you never went to freddy  s as a kid ? my sister dropped me off here all the time whenever she babysat me.  newline newline  what makes you think this involves gozer ?  zeddemore asked , lighting a new cigarette and leaning back on the one of the party tables lining the dining room . newline newline  come on , childhood mascots turned into monsters ? at least this time they  re only ten feet tall.  newline newline spengler shook his head .  the night guard reported  blood  coming from their eyes and mouth . sounds like red ectoplasm to me . gozer  s minions were transdimension demonic beings , not actual ghosts.  he pocketed the pke and set to work rigging the trap in the center of the room . newline newline  red ectoplasm ?  venkman said .  that  s the  pack your brown pants  type , right ?  he shoveled another slice of cold pizza into his mouth . they  d found it lying on the ground when they arrived , half buried in birthday streamers and used napkins . he offered the box to zeddemore , who turned away in disgust . newline newline  extreme agitation and irrationality ,  stantz said . newline newline  pissed off and stupid ,  zeddemore added .  then again , if i had to haunt some dumb family restaurant , i  d beat myself senseless too.  newline newline their digital watches chirped . midnight . newline newline they shouldered their protons packs and faced the stage . there was one thing all the stories agreed on : it began at twelve . it was relief , really . most jobs involved hours of bleary eyed solitaire games before the actual fun began . and this way the spooks could nt ambush them . probably . newline newline  three ghosts trying to throw stuffed animals at us ,  venkman said .  easiest paycheck we  ve ever had.  newline newline  something  s still not right ,  stantz whispered .  those animatronics weight half a ton each . if the ghosts are strong enough to move them , the pke should have lit up like a christmas tree.  newline newline  look ,  zeddemore whispered . newline newline the animatronics had been frozen midsong when they  d arrived . now , they were all standing straight . looking at the ghostbusters with their mouths set . except for chika , whose mouth flopped open as though her jaw muscles had rotted away . newline newline  well , looks like she  s surprised to see us too ,  venkman said . newline newline bonnie was off the stage before they could even lift their proton packs . the ghostbusters yelped and blasted her with their beams . the animatronic slowed , as if walking upsteam , but continued . only after switching their packs to full strength did it stop . its eyes slowly moved from person to person . hungry . newline newline  you said they  d be slow !  yelled zeddemore . newline newline  they should be !  stantz replied .  they don  t have the ecoplasmic mass to    he gasped .  that  s it . they aren  t possessing the animatronics . they  re driving them.  newline newline  what  s the difference ?  newline newline  it  s like powersteering . the animatronics are just a bunch of servos and hydraulics . all the ghosts have to do is possess the cpu  the machine takes care of the rest.  newline newline  if we  re done talking shop , can we please hit the switch ?   venkman roared . newline newline egon stomped on the trigger . a whirlwind of light pummeled bonnie  s frozen form , yet the animatronic remained motionless . finally , the trap closed . the smell of singed rubber and polyester filled the room . newline newline and bonnie stepped forward , limping towards the ghostbusters . newline newline  well , that  s not good ,  venkman said . newline newline  it  s too small ,  egon said .  the ecoplasmic mass isn  t big enough to get caught by the . . . good lord , they  re children !  newline newline chicka bounded off the stage and joined bonnie in the middle of the dining room . the two of stared at each other for a few moments , then turned back to the ghostbusters . newline newline  run  yelled stantz . they turned tail and sprang for the nearest door , marked  parts and service . no children.  once they were all piled in , they slammed to the door shut and turned the flimsy lock in place . only seconds later , the scraping and banging of polyester claws sounded against it . newline newline  guys , maybe we  re overthinking this ,  venkman panted .  they  re kids  piece of cake ! we  ll just pop in a vhs , give them a box of twinkies , and they  re set for the rest of the night !  newline newline the door rattled and groaned , beginning to buckle under the blows of the overpowered animatronics . the ghostbusters stacked whatever heavy mechanisms they could find against it , but it was useless : if those things could break through a metal door , a stack of hydraulics and chassis were going to stop them . newline newline  i have an idea ,  egon said , as he hefted an unused chika mask .  the two of them lacked cognitive coordination.  newline newline  are you kidding ?  zeddemore said .  they cleared the dining room like a drag racer !  newline newline  they didn  t recognize each other at first ,  egon continued .  they had to check their masks.  newline newline stantz gave a nervous , but hopeful grin .  so , it looks like we  ll have to play dressup .  ah , with lips so supple , the very flick of your tongue could bring the god s to their knees ...  newline newline his cheek brushed against the lobe of her ear , but she did not respond . newline newline  i wish only the indulgence did not have to end so prematurely .  he inhaled deeply and paused . newline newline  but i suppose that is how things must be . it is merely that all things of beauty and radiance must come to an end , and while some may argue , attempt to discredit me with my actions , or make claims that all things , regardless of this beauty or of that radiance , are bound to die ... to them , i say you understand nothing ! you do not understand that i never said those words , and if i did i hope that i am to burst into flames this moment .  newline newline  ... hmm ? what is this ? it seems i am flameless and the known has become the proven . for things that are boring , and things that are ugly , they are by no means exempt from the beauties of death . ha ! absurd ! since when has the universe been so just ? it is not that they do not die , but their death is meaningless . is it not true that a light that imparts much in life , takes away just as much in death ?  newline newline  not that such things matter to you , my darling ! you are not such , and in fact you are quite bright ... quite bright , indeed .  he ran his finger down her exposed arm .  and i mean this in more ways than one ! staring upon your flesh makes me feel as if my eyes are the endless sky , and your body is as the vast fields and forests . droplets of black , some large , some small , but all in its deepest pitch . how blessed i am to look upon you  something so divine !  newline newline the knife in his right hand rose high above her . newline newline  yet , gravity ... compels me ... oh ! how horrid ! that i am forced to kill ... my beloved !  newline newline the knife drops an inch . newline newline  and it continues to lower . no weight upon its hilt and no hand upon my shoulder . but the knife drops .  newline newline her eyes were wide , but they showed no emotion . newline newline  and i am sure it is apparent to the prophets who gaze upon me in their dreams , and to those historians who read my texts in the future , that i am compelled by nothing other than myself . and that is why it is a compulsion i am forced to act upon . because it is in ethical fastidiousness that we learn to reject the most powerful force we know , and that is acute desire . it is why passion is a fire , and not just merely a whim .  newline newline the knife drops to an inch from her chest and his head moves in close . newline newline  tell me , my sweet ... do i kill salvation ? or do i save it ? no , this moment is precious and wasted on philosophy . no , tell me ... do you ... bleed red ?  fission ... . blast !  newline newline a bright wave shoots across the plains , hitting an oversized boulder . the boulder shatters into a million pieces with a deafening blast , sending the figures behind it scurrying for safety . newline newline mercury , a short and stoutly guy , screams at the girl next to him , wrapped in a bubble of sulfuric acid , venus .  where are the others ? we can barely hold him off !  newline newline they find a temporary protection behind some trees . both of them are panting heavily . mercury takes a peek from his hiding place , to see the glowing figure of sun slowly walking towards them . the fire around sun burns brightly , consuming everything around him . newline newline mercury ducks behind the cover , trying to ignore his heart that is beating wildly . he grabs venus , shaking her . a few geysers erupt from venus  skin , something that she does when annoyed . she rolls her eyes at mercury .  can you do nt be so panicky ? she s here .  newline newline a flash of lighting erupts above mercury . mercury turns to see a redhead floating in the air , her hair fluttering wildly in the wind . two others are standing not far from her . a guy dressed in a red jacket and cap , and a girl with more piercings than she should . jupiter , mars and saturn . mercury let out a cheer at the sight of them . backup is finally here . newline newline  sun !  jupiter screams out , her voice still clearly audible despite the strong winds .  i know it s not you who s doing this ! please let us help you calm down  newline newline  fission blast !  another bright ray wave shakes the air , going straight towards the three new champions . they effortlessly dodge it , before flinging themselves at sun . newline newline  if you re not gon na listen , guess we ll have to use force then !  jupiter screams , as streaks of lighting rain down on sun . mercury watches in awe as the three of them engage sun in a intense combat . saturn tries to lock sun in with her ring traps , while jupiter and mars throw everything that they got towards sun . bright flashes and explosion shake the air . newline newline mercury turns towards venus , who is drawing circles on the dirt .  are nt we gon na help them ?  newline newline venus looks at him with her signature bored eyes and shrugs .  nah , i do nt think it makes any difference anyway .  newline newline she takes a step to her right as soon as she finished her sentence , and mars crashes down on the spot she stood earlier . his face is covered in burns and scratches , and blood is trickling down is forehead . he coughs a few time , before realizing that mercury and venus are staring at him . newline newline  ah hey , you two ,  he forces a grin , though it is obvious that he is clearly in pain .  can you please call the rest please ? think we may need all the champions to have a chance at subduing sun .  newline newline another flash fills the sky , and mercury sees two figure falling towards the ground . newline newline mars shoots the both of them another look .  now would be a good time .  newline newline      newline newline rdoritalesthe sun was blazing high above grand teton national park and the forest ranger wiped his forehead before taking a drink from his water bottle . he sighed deeply frustrated by the chaos he and his department was being put through . newline  captain , have you found anything in your sector ?  the radio buzzed . newline  nothing interesting in my area  captain dereks responded back into the mic . in the distance , he could see the helicopter surveying the other side of the lake trying to figure out where the next body could be . the past couple days had been absolute hell for him and everyone in the forestry department . search and rescues were nothing new to him or his team but this one was different because they had the fbi on the asses while being kept completely in the dark . newline in the past few months it was discovered that the oil paintings done by famed tv bob ross were real locations but bodies were being found too . three bodies later and no one could ever say this was just a coincidence but it was rumored that every single body found was charred and had looked like a hiroshima bombing victim . a serial killer arsonist with a flair for the arts sounded too bizarre to be true but the government mandated lock down was no joke . thankfully the arsonist kept his flames under control without setting the forest ablaze but burning bodies in the open wilderness didn  t make any sense at all to him . newline dereks stopped once again to stare at the tall trees around him trying to make sense of the whole operation . maddox silvens was their designated babysitter from the fbi taking over his park and that was the only clear thing he got from silvens because any other information about the operation was too high above his paygrade . it was unsettling to him that he couldn  t get any more information about why his park was next but at least the media wasn  t here to bother him or his department . he knew it was only a matter of time before the chaos of the media would arrive when words gets out that federal agents are focusing on his park . every single park in the country was closed and from talking with other park rangers his seemed to be the one getting most of the unwanted government attention . newline  amanda , any update on what we  re looking for ?  he spoke into his walkie talkie . newline  were just about done going through all of bob ross  paintings and we have narrowed it down to about 30 paintings from the show that could look like our park ,  replied amanda .  should we start looking at other works outside of the show ?  newline dereks thought for a moment  no amanda , were already searching this blindly for a possible needle in a haystack . i  m going to start heading back soon and we can over what you and jason have narrowed it down to.  just then the park ranger spotted something just beyond the trees moving . he raced over cautiously hoping not to run into something dangerous . in the clearing there was a barely clothed man groaning and trying in vain to get himself up . newline  sir are okay ? !  he yelled out running towards the helpless man .  my name is park ranger dereks and i am here to help . how long have you been lost in the forest ?  derreks examined the man but he didn  t appear to be hurt , just week from exhaustion . there were no active orders for a missing person but judging by his raggedy condition it looked like he had been out here for a while . he moved the long hair out of the mans face but he couldn  t understand what he was trying to say .  sir save your energy , help is on the way.  reaching into his bag he grabbed a flare gun and shot it into the air .  amanda , ive found an exhausted hiker and i need a medical airlift.  newline  roger that sir . medic has spotted your flare and help is on the way  responded amanda newline  run  the lost hiker weezed in his feeble state . newline  i cant do that sir , help will be here any moment  the deep look of concern on the man  s face puzzled dereks . he also couldn  t help but think the face looked familiar , was he a local , a frequent guest . newline dereks stared a little more  you  re bob r    but before he could finish the man he was holding became extremely hot and burned his hands . newline  run !  the mysterious man said one last time but it was too late . the incoming helicopter saw the bright flash of light from above and stayed hovering in place . silvens and his partner were up the hill and not far behind and saw it happen . newline  fuck ! i thought we had more time !  silvens threw his radio against the tree out of frustration while his partner got closer and looked down at the two newly charred bodies . newline  sir , we should have had two more days ! i don  t know where we went wrong  newline  i don  t care just fix it ! we can  t afford to lose another so tell the nerds back at hq to get their shit straight or i will personally shove my foot up their collective asses ! now lets move onto the next one before this tracts any unwarranted attention.  the helicopter had landed safely nearby and silven had picked up his smashed radio before heading back into the chopper with his partner . newline back at camp amanda looked at the entrance to the park and saw a group of vans approaching the gate .  im sorry guys but were closed right now  amanda had yelled at the group of white vans . they didn  t listen and the vans parked in their position . a man in a suit emerged from the leading vehicle and approached her . newline  ma  am im agent stottles with the department of homeland security . i need to speak with you director so we can begin our work here  newline  i  m sorry sir but my director is busy tending to a lost hiker he found but i can direct you to the fbi agent that has taken over before you got here.  newline  fbi ?  stottles looked confused to amanda and she saw the other vans turn around and peel off . the driver of his van poked his head out and yelled  sir ! we need to go , the target is on the move  newline without so much as saying another word he ran back to the van and they drove off . amanda ran back to her radio to get ahold of her director  sir , what is your location ? i need to talk to you when you  re back on camp.  newline newline nsfw   describes the sexual purpose of the third gender  newline newline the school bell rung  class was about to start . there was a knot in my stomach as i walked from the puzzle area , past the boys playing sports and girls knitting daisy chains . it was the day i d heard about from the older kids  sex ed . there was a strange sort of adrenaline rush from the idea of talking about something so taboo . newline newline from my knowledge of sex , i knew it involved a man and woman with a triman as an intermediate  but how the act worked was a mystery . i did nt even realise that only men had penises and only women had vaginas . newline newline when i entered the class , we sat boygirltrine and waited for our teachers to arrive . after a few minutes of patient waiting , the class turned to chatter , boys talked of sport , girls of relationships and trines of maths and various puzzles . newline newline mr dickinson , mrs muff and mrss johnson arrived through the door . the class hushed up , with the boys being the last to quieten . mrss johnson  who was wearing a fine green robe , stood at the front of the class and said in a nasally voice  today we will be having sex education , we will be splitting the class into three groups  boys with mr dickinson , girls with mrs muff and trines with me .  newline newline the male and female students left the classroom in single file lines with their respective teachers while the trines sat , ogling at the opposite genders . mrss johnson marked the start of the lesson by screeching chalk against the board writing  sex ed  . newline newline  now class  , he said articulately ,  does anyone know anything about sex ?  newline newline almost everyone in their class put their hands up  including me . i had no real idea what sex was , i would just look like a stupid girl or boy if i had nt done . alexander seemed lively to share his knowledge of sex   the man s willy goes inside the trine s vagina , where the sperm is activated and travels out of xe s penis into the woman s vagina to fertilise her !  newline newline mrss johnson raised an eyebrow .  you are right , alex  though i am slightly surprised you know that much  he said , leaning over to get alex a star shaped sticker . newline newline  now , we re going to watch a short tape which should explain sex .  johnson said , inserting a tape dated 1955 into a dusty old projector . newline newline the tape explained exactly what alexander had said , however it added detail about how the addition of the triman s dna to the male sperm allows the male sperm to fertilise a woman s egg . it showed an 2d cartoon of a triman penetrating a woman while being penetrated by a man . the tape then went on to explain the process of puberty in each gender   at aged 13 for a triman  puberty will begin . the triman will experience hair loss until they are completely bare of any body hair except for eyebrows . they will also experience an increase in the size of their activation glands next to their penis .  newline newline during puberty , a triman will start to become interested and aroused by the opposite genders  this is a completely normal and natural experience , so do not be worried if you feel this way about people . however , if you are aroused by the presence of a single member of the opposite gender  you may be a duosexual . while having duosexual thoughts is not illegal , engaging in sex with a single other partner is a sinful crime which can result in prison time or chemical castration .  newline newline when the tape was over , the whole class was taking notes . i wondered what the girls and boys were thinking  i imagined that they would have been disgusted or shocked , but us trines see things differently . the revelation of sex was merely a new snippet of information . it made everything about the world seemingly fit together like a hand in the glove  men had sex with trimen and trimen had sex with women . us trimen were the middle ground , like with everything . we dealt with the emotional side of women and the aggressive side of men and that s because we facilitate reproduction between the two .i feel the prickle of the winter wind dance upon the nape of my neck . the

magneto ,  i said ,  let s get out of here . my car s this one . yes , the hyundai bomb .  newline newline they were shooting plastic bullets at us from plastic guns . we ran like two cobbers from a

with either women or men , ha , ha , ha !  newline  newline afterwards : newline newline  magneto ,  i said ,  we are going to team up and free all the villains super heroes have put away .  newline newline  sounds alright to me ,  said magneto . newline newline we ate breakfast at an old cafe . while i had sausages and fried eggs , i smiled . my plan was coming along . to be the keymaster , the best villain ever ... the one who freed all the other villains , and led the final revolt against , superman , batman , xmen , captain courageous and the rest . yippee . newline  newline i was getting more powerful , and i suppose my ego was getting bigger too . i d freed the joker , magneto , and the penguin . newline newline  i am the boss ,  i said ,  do nt forget it , you goof offs that ca nt

newline  he s a bit arrogant , is nt he , this keymaster ,  they said . newline newline  yeah , let s get out of here ,  said another  captain america i think it was .  newline  newline that is how i was foiled in the closest a villain has ever been to taking the world over with evil . the lesson is : never get too bigheaded and arrogant when things are going your way . you ll get cut down . newline newline i live alone by myself in a cabin deep in the bush . the coin master strikes again ,  the tv anchor said .  last night at eight in the evening , police had gotten word that the

newline  that coin guy ?  i added in two more scoops of bleach , blood was a lot harder to get off than i d like to consider . newline newline  whoever that is is messed up in the head .  my sister

because you get paid by dad to do it anyway .  she ruffled my hair . newline newline  and i do nt want to see your sister s lady things , i m already more than traumatized enough from your mother s .

having ice cream . and none of them have any idea that every single thing around them is a living , thinking being newline with memories , emotions feelings of their own .  newline newline yeah newline newline  they just go by their day to day life thinking they re alone . thinking that their shoes are just shoes , and their cars newline are just cars and their husbands are just husbands . they never turn their heads around and stop to think that newline everywhere around them , a theater of consciousness just like the one inside their heads is playing . inside every newline other person , every light pole , every table and every chair . everywhere they look , a different version of reality . and newline none of them is the real one . they re all sketches . versions of a story that has no original author .  newline newline jeff the traffic light turns red again , and the cars start rushing past me . i look through their tinted windows at the newline drivers and the kids in

levon the pavement cries , as a hobo spits on the floor by my side . newline newline  newline newline thanks for reading ! for more stories , check out rpsychoalpaca    newlinei was chatting with some of my buds in an alley one day , leaning against the wall as all tryingtoohardtobecool teens do , when the damn thing opened and i tumbled in . as i rubbed my sore shoulder from the fall , i looked around . it was a classy bar . there were multicolored bottles lining the shelves , and the whole place had an oak finish . i stood up as my friends walked in .  what . the . dicks ?  rang drew .  there s a secret bar in the alley and we did nt know ?  there were gasps aplenty as we strolled through , looking at glass jars full of all manners of liquor .  dude , i hope they do nt take id .  this was sandra , my one female friend and heavy underage drinker .  sandy , i m sure they take ...  i was cut off by the sound of a door opening .  oh , dear !  came a distinctly british shout from the corner of the room . newline  what are you doing here ?  i turned to see a tall , slender woman with white hair and a black and white two piece suit . she was holding a towel and an ornate glass . i smoothly responded ,  we were in the alley when the wall opened , and i fell in .  newline  oh ! well , my name is cassi , and i m the ahem bartender here . do you have id ?  newline i heard sandy cuss under her breath , probably frustrated she would nt get to guzzle all that fancy liquor .  no , madam . we are underage anyways .  i replied .  oh , well , i m afraid i ca nt serve you ... have a good day now !  cassi ushered us out the door and closed it behind us . as i took one last look around , i noticed something peculiar behind the counter . a cauldron . newline part 2 : newline the next day , we went back to the alley , and sure enough , the wall opened to reveal the bar . cassi shot us a look as we stepped in .  did i not say we could not serve you ? please leave .  i decided to ask the question .  we will . but , one question . why do you guys have a cauldron back there ?  newline  wwhat ? oh , that . we just use that to store extra ingredients .  for a second , i thought i heard her accent slip . something here was fishy .  hey , cassi ! can you mix us up something without liquor ?  drew called as he perished the shelves .  sorry , but we could lose our license to sell alcohol if we do .  at that moment , sandy called out ,  whoa , come look at this !  drew and i dashed over to where she was . i gasped . jars of eyeballs , lizard s tails , and various other monster body parts and fallout rested in a case . i turned around to see cassi sweating and running her neck .  this is nt a bar ... is it ?  cassi let out a large sigh .  no , it is nt . this is a potion shop . it is nt typically visible to ... nonmagicks , or humans who do not have magic . it s kind of like harry potter . but you ca nt tell anyone . i m afraid we will be robbed and the store ransacked . now , please , for your own sake , leave .  we obeyed and exited the store . newline part 3 : coming soon .he sat there on a broken down couch in a seedy apartment , alone with his thoughts . in one hand was a wad of cash , waiting to be given to the shady man in the mink coat . in his other hand was a rolled up dollar bill waiting to be used on what would be laid out in front of him in the coming minutes . newline newline what was the point of staying clean now ? he was already dead inside , after having to do what he had done . newline newline he thought he was doing the right thing . he was fighting for his country overseas and everybody considered him a hero . he was the allamerican man whom every mother wanted their son to turn out like . at least it used to be that way . newline newline he lost everything when he returned home . his fiancee had left him for another man , his mother had passed away while he was at war , his antiwar sister refused to talk to him and banned him from any holiday dinners . the public would spit on him , calling him a baby killer . he thought he was doing the right thing when he was over there . he thought he was a good man . newline newline it was when he was watching the news and hearing about the war itself when he realized just what kind of monster he really was . he began to regret not running off to canada like his best friend did or going to college like his other friends did . now , they would nt talk to him because he went to war , like his father had in the korean war . newline newline he had sold everything he had for this pile of white substance . he was homeless , lost , and nobody gave a damn about him . he was doing what he felt was right at the time but nobody cared about that . nobody cared about the agent orange poisoining he got that will eventually kill him . nobody cared about the friends he made that he had to witness die . or the ambush attacks that were carried out by children , whom were just as brainwashed as he was . the old him was lost and gone forever ... .he was just a shell of whom he once was . newline newline after handing over the money to the man in the mink coat , he leaned down with the rolled up dollar bill up his nose and as the white lines disappeared , his troubles went along with it . maybe if he s lucky , he ll overdose and he ll never have to feel this pain again .i rubbed the sleep from my eyes and poured myself a bowl of cereal  milk first , then cornflakes . my groundhog day preschool ritual had begun . i grabbed the ceremonial remote control and activated the sacred tube . newline newline the tv let out a supersonic whine and produced a white dot centre stage . i shoveled cornflakes into my mouth while waiting for news . goku had been powering up for about a week and i sure was today was the day that freiza would eat spirit bomb . newline newline the dot expanded and filled the screen with reallife images . either dragonball z had gone in a new direction or i was in a lot of trouble . a shaken , blonde news reporter stood on the top of a mountain with a burning city in the background . i could just make out the harbour bridge before it toppled . newline newline  another terrorist attack ?  my younger sister asked . newline newline i flicked milk at her with my spoon . newline newline the reporter s makeup was smudged and her hair windblown . her voice quavered as she spoke . all professionalism had left her . newline newline  this is not a prank , this is not a joke . reports are coming in from all over the world . people have disappeared from their homes , planes are crashing , people ar  newline newline a deep , growling whinny drowned out all sound and a shadow flickered over the reporter . she shrieked and looked up . the camera man instinctively aimed his lens skyward as the airborne horse and rider galloped across the nearblack sky . newline newline  as you can see ,  she breaked to regain her composure ,  there are.. things.. riding in the sky . they resemble the biblical horsemen of the apocalypse . sydneysiders who are unaffected are calling the horseman you just saw war  . here s some footage we shot earlier ... mike , do we have the footage ?  newline newline a sobbing man spoke over the shaky cell phone video .  they re killing each other . theyre.. killing.. each other .  newline newline my sister crouched down beside me .  kim ?  she asked . newline newline i resisted the urge to flick her with milk .  yeah ?  newline newline  where s mum ?  newline newline  i dunno , her room ? probably out cold  she was hammered last night .  newline newline in mum s room , we found nothing but her pajamas , an empty bottle of jim beam and a halfsmoked joint in the ash tray . newline newline kiera called  mum !  until i was forced to smack her on the forehead with my milky spoon . newline newline  she s gone . probably in heaven . you know how devout she was .  i said . newline newline she wiped the milk from her face and looked up at me with glassy eyes .  what do we do ?  she asked . newline newline  get me my cricket bat , 2 backpacks with all the food we can carry , mum s car keys and a lighter .  newline newline  what are you gon na do ?  newline newline i picked the joint up from the ash tray and put it in my mouth .  go out in a blaze of glory . searing tension . crabs , garnett and laylow all made a play for the jack daniel s . yeah ! newline hey fellas there s summin outside the shelter .  newline eat a maggot garnett .  newline crabs was having none of it , garnett was clearly up to his old tricks again  the food , booze and now the jd . newline garnett grabbed crabs by the scruff of the neck . newline legit bro , theres summin out there .  newline newline they go outside to find a strange looking box on the grass . newline they open it ... ..yes !  newline newline a white flag . newline newline halleluiah , the war is over .  newline crabs was delighted . newline newline garnett opened the box , a small christmas card appeared at the corner , he opened up . newline newline dear idiots , newline congratulations , the war is over . you ve clearly given up as crabs , your buddy revealed the location .  newline the palpable anger swelled up in garnett . newline farewell  newline newline the will smith song started playing  newline tick , tick , tick , tick ... .boom !their hoofbeats were like thunder , booming through the air . their nostrils snorted fire as the contrails lit up the night . high above , in the blueblack skies , these horsemen rode dutifully delivering parcels of death and destruction to the doorsteps of the unfortunate . through the stinging rain and blistering winds , through bare light and pitch of night , the horsemen carried on . nothing stopped their onslaught . i remember trembling at the sound of them , the thoughts that crept in my head . no more . in this land of perpetual night , where the smoke and ash hangs heavily in the air , i welcome them . newline newline each time they roar past , i look to the skies and close my eyes , arms open wide . they remain far from reach . i can see it in the others as well . we look up as one looks to god . we re seeking our salvation , an exit from this miserable existence , even with a fiery end . the darkness , the loss , it wears on you . its the little things that i miss most . all i can do is scavenge for scraps of metal and food to pass the time . we ve lost track of the days since the sun was snuffed out . every day it seems to get colder . when our legs are too weary , we huddle together for warmth . not out of a closeness , but of necessity . i do nt even know their names . i doubt i could hear them anyway . newline newline our masks are clogged with the debris of the dead and dying , our visors permanently tinted black . i can even feel it leeching into my memories . i m surrounded by a slew of survivors , but i ve never felt more alone . i used to have a home , a family , friends . i could complain about long hours in the office or when traffic was moving too slow . even if i complained now , i do nt know that they d listen . that my complaints would even matter . as i sit atop a smoldering pile of concrete and steel , i can see where the wheat once grew . entire fields draped in yellow and gold now sits barren . the only things we cultivate now are loneliness and despair . newline newline with nothing to look forward to , no semblance of our past , we continue traversing these war stricken lands . when the skies light up and their hooves storm , i ll turn my head upwards in search of my prize . all i can do is wait for the day that my deliverance comes , the day that we re saved . i pray to you , horsemen of the modern world , that our rescue be as swift and painless as your aim is tried and true . newline newline 333the sounds of the screaming still echo within me . newline newline oh god ... newline newline why ? why did this have to happen ? the infernal machines rumbling , spinning through the hospital , i hear them now as i sit in the library , father running about through the

newlinenewline rob was out , and i was squirming in my bed , not able to fall asleep  as usual before a big day . i had a job interview at 10 oclock in the morning . i eventually decided to get up and get a cup of coffee . as i was doing that , in the kitchen , i suddenly started hearing a voice inside my head . it called out to me , it told me to turn around . i froze . this was the most terrifying thing i had ever experienced . but i did listen to it and as i turned around i saw a shadow figure standing there , in the dark . clapping my hands to shed more light on it did nt help . it was still completely dark , you could only make out it s shape , which was creepily humanoid . it did nt talk . it thought directly into my head . so , telepathy . it told me my roomate was a serial killer and that he was a demon from the netherworld , here to take his soul , and therefore kill him , as i understood it , and take him back into the dark lands . newline newline now this scared me . i immediately thought of the numerous bad things i had done myself in my life , certainly i had nt killed anyone , but still , if hell , or whatever this being purported to come from , was real , then ... but , wait . could it listen to my thoughts ? this was maddening . perhaps i had went mad . i threw a glass of water at it and ran outside . it did nt go after me . curiously enough , i collapsed and lost my consciousness just as i was trying to leave the premises . newline newline i woke up back in my room , the dark figure sitting beside me , on my own bed . now this was really creepy , but so far it had nt been violent with me , so i decided to keep my cool and find out what it wanted . i decided to speak to it . newline newline  can you hear my thoughts ?  newline newline  no , human , i can only speak to you this way . your thoughts are your own .  newline newline it did speak to me . it spoke to my mind . it did nt make a noise . it spoke to me internally , with a different voice than my own , one i could nt control . now , i had clearly gone mad , but what was i supposed to do ? newline newline  why do you want my roommate ? am i in trouble as well ?  newline newline  no . i am here to collect his soul , once he dies . but i ca nt kill him . what i can do is persuade someone else to do it for me . are you in ?  newline newline what the heck , why not . newline newline  yes , i m in . how do i kill my best friend ?  newline newline  you wait for him to come home and go to sleep . then you strangle him in his sleep .  newline newline  wait . but he s stronger than me .  newline newline it was weird to talk out loud to someone who only ever talked in my own mind . but as i did so , i discovered i could ignore it just as well as a normal voice outside of my head . this was nt so bad after all . it took a little concentration , but i could block it out at will . now , that presented a very different question in itself . how had it infiltrated my mind to begin with if i could block it out so easily after all ? and why had i collapsed in our backyard , earlier ? for that matter , why did i just accept this shadow figure s proposal ? newline newline i had a bad feeling about this .tuesday morning , 8:30 am . newline newline i was nt sposed to go into natelli s  not after that whole fiasco between me and lucy . i d told her i was fixed , prepared to pick up our pieces and put them back in place . she d kill the power on us if she realized i was still a broken mess . newline newline natelli s was the closest diner to the precinct for a good mile , though  shoulda never left new york . i was sure sam would nt be in this morning , too . she only worked on wednesdays  late night , graveyard shift . stayed up for the fiveo s that still gave a shit . but lo and behold , as i walked through the doors , there she was . newline newline i caught a glimpse of the bright blue streaks in her hair as she stood behind the counter . she quickly turned her head in my direction . newline newline instinctively , i averted my gaze and looked out the window at the trees across the street and the broken down green jalopy that never moved from in front of the place no matter how many tickets i put on the bastard s windshield . newline newline i realized how stupid i looked snapping my head to the side as she glared in my direction . i slowly turned my head forward , i could feel her eyes boring holes into the side of my face . newline newline new guy i ve never seen before decide to take my regular seat  back hunched forward as his eyes glared into the bright screen of his laptop behind white sunglasses . black quilted vest , brown messenger bag , slicked back raven hair , skinny acidwashed raw denim clinging to his legs  my detective kicking in again . newline newline i sat down . two waitresses came out from behind the counter , one of them being sam . thank god the other one , a blonde with long legs , started walking toward me . sam grabbed the blonde s arm and whispered into her ear with a smile . the blond looked over at me and chuckled . she nodded her head at sam and started walking toward laptop guy . shit . newline newline sam : jeff ! newline newline she patted the blonde waitress on the back and sauntered to my table . for a moment i convinced myself my name was something unordinary , quirky  ulysses . but nope ... , that was my name , jeff , unfortunately . i deeply exhaled out of my nostrils . newline newline me : hey , samantha . newline newline sam : jeffrey , you re looking a bit ... bronzed ... today . newline newline a playful grin flashed across her red lips . newline newline me : well ... , you know . newline newline lucy s enraged face sparked into my mind . i cleared my throat and looked at sam solemnly . newline newline me : went to the bahamas with lucy and the kiddo this spring . james is gettin  so big now i ca nt even pick em up . bronzed ? ha ... , just gettin  rusty . newline newline sam : oh ... newline newline her eyes opened wide in surprise . she even stepped back a bit . newline newline sam : how was that ? you and lucy ... you re still ... getting along ? newline newline i did nt wan na go through this again , especially not with her . newline newline me : we have our ups and downs , you know the deal . can i get two cups of coffee ? newline newline sam : sugar ? milk ? newline newline me : you know how i like it . newline newline i winked at her , you know , just for old times sake . her cheeks blushed . she smiled and quickly scurried away . newline newline i decided to eavesdrop on the order of the guy in front of me . guy could nt have been past his mid 20s . what was a kid that coulda passed for a brooklyn hipster doing in the overall and straw hat city of knoxville fucking iowa ? did nt make sense to me . newline newline laptop guy : may i have some tea ? oolong , please . newline newline blonde waitress : of course . newline newline as she walked away , the man began typing furiously . red arial letters flashed across the blank screen . i was stunned by the quickness of his fingers . newline newline laptop guy stared at the waitresses as they chatted with each other and prepared our drinks . the blonde girl finished first . sam always took her sweet time  this morning was no exception . newline newline the blonde waitress came out from behind the counter again , this time steadily inching forward with the mug of tea in her hand . newline newline i thought i heard the guy in front of me with the laptop chuckling lightly . i slowly raised my legs up from my seat and warily peered over his shoulder at the words on the screen . newline newline  the blond waitress spills the tea  newline newline at that moment i had found it pretty funny . new age beatnik leaves big city to travel backwater midwest for writing , i thought . as the blonde approached , the man capped of the sentence with a period . newline newline the mug plunged down from her grip as if it were smote by the hand of god . the fragile ceramic frame crashes against the marble floors , spewing oolong up and onto the blonde girl s white skirt . the woman squeals in fright . she placed her hands over her mouth and looked at the man . newline newline blonde waitress : my gosh , i m so sorry ! newline newline sam came out from behind the counter with a wet rag to help . the blonde sullenly looks down , grabbing the edges of her skirt to stare at the blob of brown on the cotton . newline newline me : hey ! newline newline i pointed at the words on his screen . he looked back at me with a guilty look on his face that told me everything . he could have just ignored my accusing finger  look back at me like i was the crazy one . but he did nt . newline newline he quickly typed something onto his screen as he looked at me with fear in his eyes . he capped off the sentence with a period . he slammed the screen down and picked up his bag . i flash my badge at him . newline newline me : hey ! detective jeffrey mack ! newline newline light sparked across my eyes as if i were hit by a flashbang , my voice muffled by the deafening roar of thunder . even behind the windows of the diner , it sounded as if i were in a shower . before i knew it , the guy was outside , his black combat boots splashing across the ground as he sprinted to the jalopy . he left his keys to the ignition on the diner table . i took out five dollars from my coat pocket and left it on the counter . newline newline me : sorry ladies ! newline newline they both looked at me in terror and confusion . i ran out the door , struggling to see past the pellets of rain pelting my face . it was enough for a flood that d make noah nervous . newline newline as i ran across the street to the broken down jalopy , i could see a light beyond the driver seat window . as i walked up to the car , it was visible that he was typing frantically again . i balled up my fist and banged on the window . the engine miraculously started . the guy closed his laptop  i could nt see inside his car anymore . he throttled the pedal of the car and the tires below the car screeched . i moved back . the tires began to spin and the car moved forward . the rain beneath the car splashed onto the dress shirt that lucy pressed out for me this morning . the car rushed ahead . from the backlights red flash i could tell that that the car turned a left . i decided to give up the chase . i was nt usain bolt and it definitely was nt a foot race . i made up my mind  i was in for the long haul . even if i had gotten into my car right then and there , followed him , i d never find him passed the veil of rain . newline newline i just stood there in the rain thinking for a bit . newline newline i could nt say that he was the one who knocked that cup out of the blonde s hand . i could just speculate . if there s one thing i ve picked up from the pound to the precinct , it s that hard facts are the only thing that gets you anywhere in life . i finally grasped something that could get me somewhere , and i was nt prepared to let go . i wanted some of what that kid had  power . newline newline the name jeffrey mackinshire was getting boring . i was nt tough . i was nt hardboiled  . i was nt sicilian like my west side upbringing convinced me to believe . i was a pasty british boy trying to blend in with tanned greasers . mackinshire for fuck sake , not macchione , not mannino  a fraud . it was time to be a real detective . so like the maltese falcon i trudged through the monsoon with false bravado , my head held humorously high . i got into my car parked a block down from the diner . i took out my phone and opened up a new blank note . newline newline  the green jalopy comes back to the diner .  newline newline i waited and waited for hours  sat there till the rain stopped . forgot that i had to be in to the precinct by ten oclock that morning . forgot that i had to call lucy about picking up james from elementary by three in the evening . forgot to come home for family dinner by eight at night . newline newline by 2:00 a.m . i gave up and opened my car to the bittersweet scent of petrichor wafting up from the uneven wet crevices of cement . newline newline figured  nothing ever really went my way . could never get what i really wanted  too many responsibilities tying me back . i had a wife and kid that loved me enough to forgive me for turning my back to them , a job that payed the bills , a car , a house , a life . newline newline what i also knew is that i had a license plate number , a badge that gave me the authority of a background check on everything in the city , tabula rasa , a good reset , something different . n  to be honest , i was ready to snatch the cards out of the dealer s hands and give myself a royal flush . newline newline i deserved it . newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinethe room seemed innocent . for dorian , that was the first clue something was wrong . places , as well as people , who looked innocent rarely were . peel back the layers , and you could smell the rot within . but most people were too stupid to notice . that stupidity more or less benefited dorian , because he was the most beautiful of all . newline newline however , he had been very careful not to fall for such traps . so when peter had asked him to come into a room , that contained a couch , some books , and several sandwiches , for  intellectual conversation  , dorian immediately got suspicious . you see , peter pan looked the most innocent of all . and that scared dorian to death .  metaphorically .  newline newline dorian approached the couch carefully . peter was no where to be seen . dorian made sure to check above him . after peter had swooped down , eaglelike , and carried dorian off to the middle of the ocean , dorian always made sure to look up . he picked up the books , and examined them for any clues . they were more rubbish about morality and being good , and all the other things boring people concerned themselves with . since dorian had nothing better to do , he sat in the couch , careful to watch the door . newline newline the chair was surprisingly comfortable . dorian was about to fall asleep , when peter pan flew into the room . the sparkles of fairy magic trailed underneath the boy s feet , and a devilish grin spread across his feet . newline newline  enjoying the chair ? i got it custom made ,  said peter . newline newline  yes , well , it s actually comfortable . now   started dorian moved his leg . well , tried to move his leg , as it was stuck . dorian immediately realized he had made a terrible mistake . newline newline  sorry . forgot to mention , there s invisible glue on it . straight from neverland ,  said peter . his execrable sprite , tinkerbell , alighted on his shoulder . newline newline  listen , you little immature elfboy . help me get out of this chair , or i will hunt you down . you should remember , only one of us can afford to die ,  said dorian . most people dorian could get around , either by outwitting , or bedding them . peter was not an option for either , as he had a profound mixture of childishness , cunning , and inhumanity that made him unimpressed by dorian s influence . dorian would have respected him for that , if he was older . as it were , peter was just annoying . newline newline  actually , you really should nt try to leave the chair , because ... actually , tinkerbell says i should let you find it out by yourself . bye !  said peter , who flew off . newline newline  get back here !  said dorian , who tried to jump out from the chair . a clicking sound came from under the chair , like some mechanism was being unlocked . a feeling of dread crept up dorian s spine . wait , had nt he thought he d seen a spring or something under the chair ? newline newline then the floor underneath the chair collapsed . dorian soon found himself falling from a great height to the ground . newline newline right before he hit the ground , and suffered yet another death from peter s prank , he heard the boy s laughter .the hero was dead and the world rejoiced . newline newline it s not that people did nt like him , they really did . he was everything you d want . kind , humble , handsome , strong both physically and mentally , unyielding in defense of justice and the disenfranchised . everything anyone would ever want to be . so no one could admit that they wanted him dead without seeming petty , envious , pathetic . newline newline but really , humanity hated him . we hated him . because he was better than every single one of us . he was smarter , stronger , quicker , and never failed  not once , not ever . he was not only an ideal to strive to , he was an impossible one . next to him , every single person was weak . to empower a human , you can do it through money , political clout , physical training , hobbies , success ... but no matter how exceptional you were , he would always be there  dwarfing whatever anyone else could do . newline newline lex luthor was a sociopath , brilliant and machiavellian . no one saw through his plan , decades in the coming . all his failures , no matter how horrible they made him look , were just steps on a ladder , until he reached the olympus and toppled the one living god among men . newline newline how could humanity not be inspired ? a man , albeit an exceptional one , through sheer determination had destroyed superman . suddenly , getting good grades in college mattered , because it had for lex luthor . succeeding in business could give you real power . there was nothing humanity could not do . the impossible was possible again . of course they celebrated . newline newline we all did . newline newline because when humanity puts its mind to it , even gods may bleed . newline newline  newline newline clark kent smiled at his editorial . the time for superheroes had ended . humanity would be just fine on its own . perhaps lois would finally agree to that dinner . after all , what man does nt want to enjoy the small things in life ?bowser stood before the assembly and waited for the crowd noise to fall . he held the room for another moment and closed his eyes , holding what may be his last breath in silence . newline newline  countrymen . i call you here today to gain your strength , to join in your suffering , and to create new life . the policies of this new kingdom are false . no longer can we hide beneath the ground in fear .  newline newline  you ,  he extended a hand to the goomba delegation ,  she calls you poisonous . she takes your families , your fungi , and appoints those only like herself as worthy . no longer !  newline newline  and you ,  his other hand points toward the confederacy of turtles ,  she takes your children and makes weapons of them . no longer !  newline newline  she thinks us weak , but i am not here to challenge that .  newline newline the crowd did not know how to feel about this statement . bowser always held a strict hand , as fair as he tried to appear . many of the groups met before his speech and considered that this could be nothing more than a power grab . perhaps the princess had crossed the line that he himself had been too scared to risk . bowser knew this , and paused to let their thoughts sink in . newline newline  we are weak because we allow it ! we are weak when newline the only fresh air we breathe comes at the end of a pipe ! when she taxes our coins and steals our questionable supplies ! is this the life you will give to your children !  newline newline a goomba councilman rises to ask ,  what of the gods ?  newline newline  what gods ?  newline newline  the overalled ones . the humans .  newline newline  they are no gods .  newline newline  what do you say to the scouting reports then ? they have been seen shape shifting , flying , producing fire from their hands . there are too many reports to brush them all aside .  newline newline  and those same reports speak of their deaths and their loss of power when attacked . these are the marks of false gods . they can be defeated .  newline newline  we will build a series of fortifications , all along our territory . and we will fly our flags high to make it clear who controls us . we will arm each pipe with our own fire breathers and establish patrols around each city . bridges will be reinforced and walls raised .  newline newline  if their false gods wish to fight us in our homes , they will have to fight every step of the way to get here . i ask you this , are you as weak as the princess believes ! ?  newline newline to be continued ...it was nt the first time we d been invaded . however , it was the first time that the invaders had been so miserably unprepared . newline newline they d come down in primitive cosmic contraptions which might as well have been boxes of steel with an engine attached to them . the first quarter of their strikeforce was left thoroughly confused as it did nt seem to be able to make it past our invisible force field . they were nt familiar with the concept . newline newline as the next hoard arrived , we did them the favour of disabling the force field simply to save them the humiliation of dying in the colds of space . the parents sent their kids out with toy guns to go have fun killing the creatures which arrived from the sky . unfortunately they arrived as debris , flames , as ashes because of our planet s atmosphere . it was a disappointing day to say the least . newline newline two months passed and for some reason , the humans , fully committed to their original plan came back , having decided losing half their squad was nt enough . their boxes seemed to have some extra layers of wrapping around them now . newline newline we welcomed them with open arms , hoping this time that they d make it to the surface . and they did . well , some of them . maybe 500 out of 10000 . newline newline our children launched punches at each other trying to get to the sacred 500 first . maybe that had been their plan all along , to make us turn against ourselves . newline newline nah . they were stupid . newline newline there were scenes all around the area where the humans had landed . some quickly bagged one up for themselves to see how they were with a bit of seasoning and marinate in them . extremely bitter , it turned out , with a tinge of saltiness . others tried helping then out of their bobblehead gear only to see them shrivel up and explode upon coming in contact with the air . newline newline eventually there was only one left . as per orders received from the monarchy , he was brought to the king of the planet . newline newline  so , your kind had the audacity to try and invade us ?  newline newline  well yeah but it was just them , not me  newline newline  why are you here then  newline newline  oh i m a business man . im just here to expand my market , you know  newline newline  oh , that makes sense . please do show me your business plan ,  the king amused himself as he walked the bobblehead man into his chambers . newline newline  so how it works is we have a monthly gift exchange . all you have to do is buy one gift to get 150 of them in return from others ...  newlinetaylor rushed past the hordes of reporters that lined the pathways of the spacious university campus . she dashed in and out between the teams of reporters preparing to go live in a matter of minutes , without causing a second glance in her direction . it felt like a lifetime since the news had been made public , when in reality , the leak had gone live two hours ago . no one quite knew of what to make of the news . how could anyone react to realization that we had never been the only ones in the universe ? to make matters even more puzzling , the fish like sentient creature had been discovered right in our solar system right on jupiter  s own europa . before taylor even had time to make any sense of the news , she had received a call from her boss to rush directly to the  stage  as he liked to call his prep room for the presidential debates . when taylor finally pushed her way to the locked classroom door , she knocked twice and entered the dark room to find her boss hunched over a nightlight and a humidifier . newline newline  taylor have you heard ?  he asked without looking up from the light . she nodded . newline newline  i have . now what ?  newline newline newline the year was 2020 and the presidential election was being hyped up more than ever before . nobody in a thousand years could have ever predicted the outcome of the 2016 election . with only ten days to go before the general election , hillary clinton , after being fed up with trump  s sexist remarks , challenged trump to a bakeoff . if trump could bake a better devil  s food cake , then she would renounce her bid for the presidency . much to everyone  s surprise , the guy could bake some of the best cake anyone could ever have . however , to no one  s surprise , when donald trump entered the presidency , he shrugged off his idea to build a giant wall and focused his attention of expanding the space program . drawing money from his own personal fortune , donald trump turned the united states space program into the best in the world . when asked why he cared so much about space exploration , typical trump would respond that he wanted to have another option in case those damn muslim terrorist blew up the earth . newline newline everyone had always assumed that trump would run for reelection , but he insisted that he didn  t intend to stay in office for more than four years . now , if people thought that trump running for president was crazy that was nothing to what the 2020 presidential candidates were . sure some were extremely well qualified , but others , let  s just say no one ever considered would be running . among those was rapper kanye west , who ran with the democrat party . somehow , he rose to the top of the polls , and before anyone could say are we really doing this again , another entertainer became a contender for the white house . nobody for the life of them could figure out how they got kanye west vs sarah palin 2020 . newline newline taylor snapped the compact mirror shut and tossed it into her tote before looking at the man sitting across from her on the private jet as they flew straight towards the hollywood hills . he was dressed in an immaculate black tux , a new look for him . she stayed quiet as she waited for the man to speak . after all , he had called her and she wasn  t one to speak unless spoken to . after a brief moment of silence , the rapper cleared his throat and tapped his hand on the table . newline newline  taylor , i understand that we haven  t been on speaking terms of as lately , but i need your help.  newline newline taylor stayed silent and feigned disinterest as she turned her head to look at the dozens of aquariums scattered throughout the plane . newline newline  as you  ve probably heard , i  m running for president in 2020 and i  ve got a serious problem . i  ve done a fair bit of polls and research on my end and it appears i might have this election in the bag . i need you to make sure it stays that way.  newline newline taylor laughs and shakes her head .  what do you need me for . you can hire the very best campaign manager money can buy . i don  t have any political experience and quite frankly i could care less about this type of stuff.  newline newline  that  s true , but you are the very best at keeping people  s attention . i want you to make sure that the public continues to pay attention as i lay low for a while . and perhaps maybe even stir up some dirt on palin while you  re at it . i can assure you that you will be very justly rewarded for this.  kanye folds his fingers on top of each other and stares in taylor  s direction . newline newline  why would you stay low at a time like this.  newline newline  let  s just say mr. trump is onto something huge that i have a personal stake in . now , do we have a deal or not ?  newline newline taylor laughs and begins to stand up from her seat before kanye grabs her hand and holds her in place . newline newline  i can help make them pay . all of those guys who left you without a second glance in your direction won  t have the last word . after all , everyone assumes that guantanamo shut down , and who  s to say that is or is not true . paper work gets lost all the time and sometimes try as we might stuff happens by accident.  kanye smiles at the last bit . newline newline taylor looks over at kanye and sits back down . perhaps she could listen , if only for just a second . newline newline newline  taylor , i need you to get the word out.  kanye half whispers . taylor frowns in confusion . newline newline  this is weird , i  m going to turn the lights on ,  she says . before kanye can stop her , taylor flips the light switch on . she stifles a scream as she realizes that she is surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of fish bowls with fish floating in them . right in front of her , kanye is dressed in an aqua metallic wet suit . newline newline  what  s going on ?  she manages to get out . kanye smiles and outstretches his hands . newline newline  don  t you understand swift  this recent discovery has helped me come to terms with who i am . it  s time that everyone knew . after this , i  m going to renounce my bid for presidency and give my support for you.  newline newline taylor  s heart picks up in excitement . newline newline  okay then , what should i tell the awaiting public ?  she asks . newline newline  tell them that i , kanye west , am a gay fish.  newline i m so proud of you , do nt forget that .  newline newline mom only ever says that when i win prizes . which is great news for me , the pride of my school , my family , the boy who will grow up to become the finest doctor to represent the walt household . there s a lot of love to go around our house . newline newline so when the mailman rings our door my mother and i go hand in hand . newline newline it s our spring magazine , women s weekly . my top gear . mom glances over the separated magazines i clutch . newline newline i remember the backhanded fury i received when she uncovered the stray playboy tucked underneath the walt pile . it was a terrible mistake , of course , mom and i know this is a sin , that my missing molars were a small price to pay for my dirty soul . but i am clean now . newline newline she s satisfied . we thank the mailman as he rides off the musty road , and mom takes her magazines with her to the restroom . as her door clamps shut , my heart clamps too as a draped figure saunters down my pathway . he holds a scroll in his hand.. a map ? newline newline a lost tourist . normally my mom and i talk together but if it s just a tourist , i m sure we can overlook this . newline newline i greet him with a cheerful but snuffled hello . he does nt offer me courtesy . but he does glare at me , with his uncomfortably rabid eyes . grey , turbulent beads . perhaps not so friendly . newline newline  do nt call for that lady .  newline newline how unsettling . newline newline  e , excuse me ?  newline newline he does nt blink . newline newline  do you mean my mother ? newline newline  do not call for that woman . i am your brother and i m here to help you .  newline newline he s must be out of his mind , and i do nt like this situation one bit . coming out alone was a regrettable mistake . i squawk out for my mom . newline newline this man does nt like this , his expression contorts into subtle anger . newline newline  you re living with a bitch . i m your brother . i m your brother .  newline he pulls out a gun and aims it at me . newline newline  just come with me . whether you like it or not , you re coming . shoot now or talk later .  newline newline i m wailing now . some neighbouring faces appear in my peripherals . some dialing for help , others observe . newline newline flush . newline newline  who is it ?  newline my mom s footsteps twist the mood . the man s impatience bares itself . newline newline  she is not your mother ! our mother is dead and she took her from you !  newline newline the neighbours come out of hiding . nobody can miss this now . newline newline mom appears from the corridor into the light of the terrace entrance . her face is shrouded in a sense of unease . she recognizes this mysterious man . newline newline they stare at each other . eyes grey as winter , motionless as the icecaps , still in the vastness of the antarctic . newline newline a pistol produces itself from the flaps of my mother s dress . she aims it at this man s head . his expression remains still . he is prepared for death . he was as soon as he strolled into my home . newline newline bang . newline newline he collapses on the ground . blood trickles down his body from the puncture in his torso . a clean shot , perforating his lungs , embedded into his burning flesh . my brother gurgles on his own blood , writhing on the ground , dying . newline newline his gun skitters across the ground , like the tears that scamper off my face . newline newline  i know .  newline newline the smoke from the barrel of my gun floats up , disappears into the air . i put my pistol back into my pocket , and i shut the door behind us . newline newlinetai rai cho , the world s renowned pugilist in asia , woke up inside the hull of a ship after a couple of jin soldiers have dunk a bucket of water on him . he found himself tied down by ropes . his feet were bounded and his hands were tied to his back . he tried to break out of them , but after a long period of struggle , he learns that the ropes are made of silk , one of the toughest material in asia . newline newline what happened ? cho thought to himself . the last place he remembered being at was at the bar . the wine he was drinking was probably tainted by someone . newline newline the soldiers carried him up the stairs to the main deck of the ship . cho squinted his eyes in reaction to the blinding light outside . the soldiers throw him down onto the deck and forced him into a kneeling position . cho looks up towards him . newline newline in front of him he could see an absurdly obese man lying on a golden mattress , inside a tent . maidens each on his side were fanning him with beautifully embroidered peacock feathers . newline newline  give me my pillows  , said the fat prince to the servants at his side . two groups of servants in each side of the mattress exert great efforts to lift his torso up by pulling up his arms while another group of servants gathered pillows around his back . newline newline the fat prince panted after it was done . newline newline  so this is the famed tai rai cho .  said the fat prince . newline newline  and to what pleasure do you owe me , prince sh ln ?  said cho . newline newline  you know of something that is very important to me . tell me where it is .  newline newline  what is it that you seek ? !  newline newline  you know .  newline newline cho paused for a moment with a confused look . newline newline  your highness , i do nt know what you are looking for .  newline newline the prince paused for a moment . newline newline  i forgot ... what was i looking for ?  newline newline cho wanted to do a facepalm , but too bad he was tied up . newline newline  your highness ,  whispered one of his servants ,  we are looking for the jade lamp .  newline newline  ah yes !  exclaimed the fat prince  all this remembering is tiring me .  newline newline  the legendary artifact that grants anyone s wishes ?  pondered cho ,  and how do you think i would know that ?  newline newline  your highness ,  the servant whispered again to the prince s side ,  perhaps we have nt thought this through enough .  newline newline  silence ! i know he s the man with knowledge about the jade lamp ! now , tell me where it is or i will have my guards behead you !  newline newline  i said that i do nt know  said cho . newline newline  guards ! bring him to

newline  newline newline confession time i have nt read game of thrones . i m waiting to make sure he does nt robert jordan before the last book .a ratty scarf laid crumpled on our bed . tears coursed through the fabric in hues most would consider color ,  but begged for argument . coarse , rough , it looked hard to wear , let alone see . newline newline it was a wonder scott wore that thing . one small section even had crusted mucus still on it , likely from a few days ago when we walked the park together . spring season did terrible things to him , but he knew i loved seeing the flowers bloom . newline newline one hole was gaping like a dying breath in that mess . from when some dumb dog jumped on the park bench chomping on it this afternoon . scott wore that mess everywhere , even for our short lunch trips . i caught him a few times biting into it accidentally while awkwardly trying to dive a forkful of chinese , the scarf acting as a chute sometimes . newline newline so it must have thought the scarf would taste as good as it smelled  but never as it looked , god  . scott won that battle for the scarf , but scars still etched through most of whatever strands remained . he wore it back on our way home , fighting his sinuses , muttering about the damage . it somehow got uglier . we were so surprised we laughed . newline newline when we got home this evening i asked him why he still wore such a mess . it looked genuinely awful . newline newline like i could toss this , there s plenty of mileage on this thing yet . still keeps me warm , right ?  newline newline he took off his coat , shoes , dumped the scarf on the bed and is showering at the moment . leaving me alone with it . newline newline i could nt help but smile . scott did nt even say it . that i made the scarf for him our first christmas together seven years ago . he just liked wearing it still after all this time . newline newline still keeps me warm , right ?  newline newline i would nt know . could nt be

desk like she always did at 3pm on tuesday , before she had tea with her grandmother , who would be over shortly . dagny s short brown hair was drawn back into a bun and her thick black glasses masked her eyes . she was taking a second look over the essay she had written a week ago and gnawed on her tongue as if to punish herself for her lousy sentence structure . newline newline from behind her , she heard a knocking on what she only could assume was the front door and stood up to answer . she was somewhat relieved that her grandmother was early , because it meant that she could procrastinate on her essay for a while longer while they caught up wtih each other . she trundled down the stairs and opened the front door to her townhouse , only revealing bleak autumnal colors and scraping dry leaves on her door mat . newline newline she closed the door and twisted her brow into a frustrated , but curious distortion . then , she heard a knocking again , but it was faint coming from her room . she felt her body stiffen for a moment , frozen with fear as she looked at the door frame of the room . she remembered some sage advice from her best friend , laquisha :  only these dumbass white motherfuckers run upstairs in horror movies , that s why they always get killed , shiiit .  newline newline she knew laquisha was right , and she also knew that although she was white , she was nt a dumbass white mothefucker . nonetheless , the knocking did spark her curiosity . she had opened the closet only a half hour ago and had nt left the room since then . whatever was knocking on her closet door was not a rapist or a robber , and she did nt take the idea of monsters very seriously , or really anything paranormal . if it was something paranormal , why would it knock ? why not barge in and destroy her completely ? whatever it was , she was a biomed major , and if it was something weird , maybe something ... new , she wanted to see it . she wanted to discover it . newline newline she had to investigate her curiosity outweighed her fear , and even if laquisha called her a dumbass motherfucker later , she had to know what was behind the closet door . she armed herself with a baseball bat she kept under her couch and crept slowly upstairs . she came to the closet and the knocking continued three more paced , even knocks . they dropped a sense of dread into her tummy as she realized that she had crossed the mental point of no return . she inched her hand toward the door , feeling terror consuming her as her fingers wrapped around the metal knob . newline newline she yanked the door open quickly and peaked her head around . there was a brown haired woman standing on the other side , clutching a small sphere in her left hand some masterfully crafted alien technology . the woman smiled timidly . she was completely human and very normal , but wore clothes from a much different time period rennisance if dagny was guessing . the woman waved with her right hand and calmly said , newline newline  um ... hello . can i use your phone ? do you have phones in this era ? cedric sorted through the list of messages on his pad . all fivehundredandninetytwo of them . all marked urgent . newline newline most of them were the usual drek .  my house was robbed by immigrants ,  one read .  a clone stole my identity ,  read another .  bioroids are cracking my data streams ,  from a third . typical stuff . old people , who were used to who things were , and did nt understand that the lapd had stopped pretending to give a shit . when at least a hundred people are murdered each week , there s just not enough manpower to respond to petty robbery , or breaking and entering complaints . newline newline cedric slid back in the chair and massaged his temples ,  you find anything interesting over there , ash ?  newline newline  out of the fourhundredandeightyeight messages in my inbox , three of them appear to be worth investigating ,  the bioroid responded . newline newline  really ? that many ?  newline newline  all three of them are in relation to the same case , but i believe that case is worth investigating , so technically , there are three messages worth responding to .  newline newline cedric chuckled ,  fair enough . what s the case ?  newline newline ash pressed a few buttons , and the messages projected themselves on the wall .  they all are in relation to a new reactive company , calling themselves zaroff industries , that s promising their customers the ability to murder anyone they like , in vivid detail . i ve sent the company s site to your pad , if you re interested .  newline newline  i am ,  cedric murmured , glancing at the information . newline newline the website was pretty barren , except for a small list of features  offered by the company , and contact information . some of the listed features included ,  top of the line survivalinstinct ai ,   detailed facial mapping ,  and  hyper realistic blood .  newline newline  i ll give you that it s a little ghoulish , but it s hardly illegal . what are the complaints about ?  cedric asked , without looking up . newline newline  that s where it gets interesting . we have video testimony from a mr. spet , civid 1493197979612 , which claims that  i think it d be best if we just watch it .  ash pressed a few more buttons , and the disheveled face of a man in his mid thirties appeared on the screen . newline newline  hello , my name is harold spek , and i swear that the testimony i m about to present is , to the best of my knowledge , the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . newline newline on the evening of july 12 , 2103 , i visited zaroff industries , and took part in one of their reactives . i was curious what it d be like to kill someone , and ... i guess that s not relevant . the scenario i d selected , was one where i d stalk , and then murder a homeless man with a large knife . newline newline the scenario went well , until i got to the actual kill part . when i saw the guy s face , i recognized it . it was one of the homeless guys who hung out on a corner a few blocks away from my container . i mean i d never talked to the guy before , but i d seen him enough to recognize his face . newline newline well , after the . . . murder , i left his  body in a dumpster off 942nd . after the scenario finished , i ran as quickly as i could to the actual dumpster and i found the body inside , same position i left him in , knife wound in the same spot . i immediately took video of the guy , which i ve attached , along with a recording of my reactive . newline newline i do nt know what else to do , i mean i never would have gone there if i d know   newline newline ashe turned the video off ,  he continues babbling like this for another twentyeight minutes .  newline newline  have you reviewed the records ?  cedric asked . newline newline  my computer s been analyzing them since we accepted the case .  newline newline  and ... ?  newline newline  judging by the blood splatters , and the nature of the wounds , in question , there s a 92  chance that these recordings depict the same crime scene .  newline newline  so zaroff industries is killing people , and selling live footage of their deaths as reactives ?  newline newline  it would appear so .  newline newline  that would explain their twentyfive trillion dollar payment to the city permit office .  newline newline  i do nt follow .  newline newline  well , while you were analyzing the footage , i ve been tracking their expenses , trying to figure out where their money s been going . and , in addition to their standard business license , there s an additional twentyfive trillion going to the permit office . which means one of two things , either they want to found their own sovereign nation , or they need a class d murder license . that would also explain why they ve dedicated so little money to r  d , and machine upkeep   newline newline  so rather than actually running the simulations , they ve been piping the guy s camera feed back to the room , and calling it a reactive .  newline newline  precisely . now all we need to do is make sure they actually purchased the license ,  cedric said , leaning back in his chair . newline newline  i m putting the records on the screen as we speak .  newline newline after a few minutes of searching they found proof that zaroff had purchased a license , making any murders they would commit for the next year , perfectly legal . newline newline newline all in a day s work .the third episode of breaking bad had just ended which meant it was time for an intermission . paul got up to make some more popcorn while greg moved over to the computer . newline newline  you want extra butter ?  paul asked . newline newline  yeah mhmm ,  greg replied , distracted by his incessant searching . he had read online that one  s netflix history reveals a lot about a person . he was hoping to find a few risqu titles that paul had watched . sadly , most of the things seemed ordinary for a 300 pound tattoo covered gym rat . newline newline greg was just about to give up when something caught his eye .  my little pony  sat there among titles like  house of cards  and  arrow.  this was a gold mine . newline newline  william , come check this out ,  he said . newline newline

various wounds . his cowl had been shreded and mangled , completely exposing his face . all pretense of maintaining a secret identity had been abandonded as umbra stepped softly into his home through the front door . newline newline no lights were on and the house was silent . peering in the darkness , umbra s superior night vision detected no trace of movement . newline newline  claire ?  newline newline their was no response save the high pitched whine of the emergency broadcast system ringing out from a neighbor s television . ascending the stairwell , umbra made his way to his daughter s room , hoping to steal one last glimpse of his little girl before everything would be reduced to ash . poking his head around the door he found his daughter s bed empty . newline racing down the hall , umbra flung open the door to his bedroom to find his bed empty , neatly made with an envelope addressed to him on top of the comforter . puzzled , umbra reached out and began to read the letter :

they re ready , mrs. president . may god forgive us if we use them .  newline newline president herbert nodded .  thank you for all your work , dr . kane .  newline newline they looked into one another s eyes for a brief moment of silence as they contemplated dark thoughts . then the secretary of defense stepped into the room .  mrs . president .  he said .  they re entering orbit now . we re ready to transmit .  newline newline she nodded and giggled childishly .  i never thought they d be back during my term . i d wanted to do what i could to help prepare my successors ... but i had hoped it would nt fall to me .  she swiped dr. kane s flask and took a gulp to calm her nerves . a deep breath seemed to calm her nerves , and she steeled herself for what was coming .  let s go .  she said . newline newline      newline newline the cameras were set up in the conference room when she and her entourage entered . after a minute to prep , they opened communications . newline newline  so you have returned , as you said you would .  she stated .  i am president herbert of the world coalition government . do you make the same demands of us as you did before ?  newline newline the alien reply was a transmission that corrupted the terminals in the room , which began displaying the face of the vaguely reptilian hominids .  we have come to settle upon your world . your civilization will submit and be made to service us or it will be destroyed and your race made extinct . do you accept this ultimatum , or will you force me to end your people ?  newline newline  i have a counterproposal for you .  president herbert began .  we have a concept , from an earlier part of our history , when there were many nations competing with one another on this world . it s called mutually assured destruction .  she paused and clasped her hands behind her back .  now i know that our technology ca nt compete with yours , and the vast fleet arrayed against us outnumbers anything we could hope to field . but despite that , i promise you we can retaliate . we can destroy your homeworld wherever it may be without ever leaving ours .  newline newline the alien made a whurbling sound that the analysts flagged as laughter .  you expect me to believe such a thing ? you would bluff when the fate of your people is at stake ? and such an absurd claim ! ? you are foolish .  it clicked its tongue .  surrender , while i still find you amusing .  newline newline  dr. kane , if you would ?  president herbert asked . newline newline he nodded and stepped forward to stand next to her . facing the camera he spoke .  are you aware of how the universe came to be formed ?  he asked .  it was a single point of origin from which all the matter and energy that has ever existed and likely will ever exist , burst forth . we call it the big bang . imagine such an event happening now . a wall of impenetrable energy , expanding outwards at the speed of light , consuming this universe and giving birth to a new one . the edge of the new universe would , in effect , pull ours into it . from our perspective , everything would be destroyed almost instantly . from the perspective of the new universe , it would take billions of years . we have the capability to trigger such an event . and that is not even the worst of what we can unleash .  he finished . newline newline the alien paused , and spoke to people behind him . the analysts decided that he was conferring with his equivalent of advisers . finally , after several tense minutes , the alien turned back to face them .  you say that you have such a weapon , but my philosophers say that the only means for you to prove it would be for you to use it . as i can not withdraw without proof of defeat , i am forced to assume you are bluffing and attack . unless you would care to allow my philosophers to inspect your weapon ?  newline newline the analysts noted that philosophers  were probably the alien equivalent to scientists , and that there were likely ulterior motives behind the request . president herbert frowned .  you intend for us to reveal our weapon so that you can attempt to take or disable it .  she snorted .  fine . we would rather risk that than a conflict no one would win .  newline newline the alien peels its lips back in a mockery of a smile .  excellent . my officers will be landing shortly .  newline newline      newline newline dr. kane went with the party sent to escort the aliens . he had his own misgivings about allowing them so close to his device , but he knew they had no real choice . newline newline the alien delegation surprised him . they were all ... civilians . a bunch of teachers and scientists , sent down without any military escort at all . they were nt even armed .  greetings .  one of them spoke to him . it ... had no sexual identifiers that he could use to mentally assign a pronoun .  you are the philosopher responsible for making the weapon ?  it asked . newline newline  yes ...  he began .  well , me and a team of others .  he said . newline newline  why would you make such a thing ! ?  it demanded .  with the claimed potential to destroy all of the universe ?  newline newline  it was nt meant to be a weapon .  he replied .  we were trying to make a power source . open a pocket dimension , instigate a big bang , then siphon off the resulting energy and matter . if it became unstable , the pocket dimension could be ejected safely from our reality . i wanted to contribute to the wellbeing of society . this ... was nt the direction i intended .  newline newline it stared at him for several long moments before nodding .  a mistake , then , to share your work . you should have destroyed it all .  newline newline dr. kane shrugged .  yet despite it s potential for destruction it might still save my world from the threat your people pose .  newline newline it could not argue against that . newline newline      newline newline  so this is it ?  the alien asked .  the weapon which can at once end all that is and reset it to its original state . how fascinating .  newline newline  it was my life s work .  dr. kane said . newline newline  a pity , then .  it stepped forward and touched something on its arm , causing a shield to form around it and the weapon . all electrical components within the shield shut down and stopped working .  i shall be taking it for study .  newline newline dr. kane laughed . he could nt help it . the betrayal was so clich that he would have been surprised if the alien had nt attempted something . newline newline  what do you find so amusing ?  it asked curiously . newline newline  did you think we d only build one ? get out and meet people . gregor thinks to himself in his mother  s voice . he dries his palms on his blue jeans then dips his right hand into his front pocket and fiddles the fake coin , his goto  ice breaker that often goes nowhere . the ad for the local magicians meetup that he found in the back of the city paper seemed an appropriate place as any . gregor loved sleight of hand and assumed everyone else who did was probably as socially terrible as him . newline newline the address of the meetup was an old brownstone downtown . gregor checked three times to makes sure this was the place .  this can  t be it . he reaches out for the brass door handle and misses . the door is open and gregor is still looking at his hand confused by he messed up something as simple as opening a door . by the time he sees the man in the suit gregor realizes that he has been staring at his now crotch high hand for entirely too long .  welcome ,  the body wearing the suit says . newline newline  thanks ,  gregor says as he unclaws his hand for a shake . the suit grabs it firmly , slaps him on the shoulder with the other hand and pulls him inside . newline newline the foyer s marble floors reflected the chandelier flawlessly . gregor thought about cleaning them and was glad he did nt have to . then an image of the mounting pile of dishes in his own sink popped into his head .  is nt it beautiful ,  the man said as he walked gregor towards the closed double doors . newline newline  it really is .  newline newline  i m just glad i do nt have to clean it .  newline newline  i was just thinking that .  now gregor was thinking about hollow earth theory . maybe he could meet a girl from inside the earth or at least one who could pretend to be . gregor realized that maybe he should stop thinking about bizarre scifi sexcapades and talk to the stranger in the mansion . newline newline gregor opened his mouth but before he could speak the man was opening the door .  hold that thought , gregor .  newline newline he did nt remember introducing himself but could nt say for sure . he reassured himself by checking his pocket for the fake coin . it was there . maybe he had said his name . maybe the mystery girl could wear a lizard mask and a tattered burlap halter like the rest of the inner earth savage sexy reptoids . newline newline the man shook his head as he opened the door . the only sound was the high pitched creak of the heavy oak door moving on its ornate brass hinges . newline newline  am i the first one here ?  gregor asked upon hearing the silence . his question was answered when he realized the entire ballroom full of people had turned in unison to face him .  did i fart ?   gregor thought . newline newline from the back of the room gregor heard a muffled snort laugh . immediately followed by a slap .  you didn  t fart , lizard fucker ,  someone shouted from the back of the crowd . the room burst into a fit of reluctant drunken laughter . newline newline gregor turned bright red . if he had latent superpowers he  d love for them to manifest now . newline newline the man next to him in the suit studied him for a second .  no superpowers . right ?  gregor shook his head defeated .  just checking.  newline newline  you can all eat a dick ,  gregor thought . newline newline the man in the suit spun gregor back through the door and across the grand foyer .  maybe this isn  t the group for you.  newline newline back on the street he brought the fake coin out of his pocket . maybe its time for a new hobby . gregor threw the coin as hard as he could down the street .chester rustled from his saturday afternoon snooze at the sound of the doorbell . i left the couch , book still in hand , and greeted the ups man at the door . newline newline  mr . anderson ?  he said . newline newline  that  s me.  newline newline  we found this package tucked away between two old storage carts at the very back of our facility . it should have been delivered about ten years ago.  newline newline  wow , i  m surprised you still delivered it ,  i said truly amazed . newline newline  we  re sorry we lost it , but if you  ll just sign here i  ll get on my way.  newline newline i signed and took the package . sitting back down on the couch . i put my book down and grabbed my pocket knife to open the old tapedup cardboard covering . chester laid back down by the vent and dozed off again . newline newline i brought the knife edge to the seams of the package and carefully cleaved the two pieces of cardboard apart . it was a book . i looked at the receipt and saw that i had ordered it in october 2001  the early days of amazon.com . after discarding the outdated receipt , i turned my attention to the book . it was kerouac  s on the road . this used to be my favorite book . wow , i forgot how much i loved this book . newline newline the spine and pages were still crisp and clean . if i  d received this on time , i  m sure the pages would be worn down and bent out of shape . newline newline i turned the first pages and came to the table of contents . it simply said :  pg . 1  on the road.  simplicity . i liked it . i leaned back on the cushion and began reading the first part . as i read , chester let out a quick snore . sal and dean seemed so restless . i think that  s what drew me to the story so much when i was younger . i wanted to move , explore . i looked over at chester again . he was sprawled out on the floor , perfectly content . i looked down at the end of the couch and saw my feet there propped up on cushion , soft and comfortable . i began to crave that sense of movement and freedom that dean and sal grasped so firmly . newline newline i kept reading and i kept thinking back on my life in the past ten years . when i first read on the road , i wanted to take that road trip . i wanted to hitchhike from new york to denver to mexico city and back to new york . there was something appealing about tired and calloused feet . what  s changed since then ? newline newline i put the book down , gathered chester  s leash , and we set out for a walk .dear john ,  newline newline i have watched you every night , my love . you have not realized it , but i am here , like a guardian angel . i saw you agonize everyday about how you would eat and pay the bills . no more , love .  newline newline i will free you from your shackles .

again tonight . will you watch for me ?  newline newline love ,  newline your secret admirer newline newline john closed up the envelope , put all the money inside , and headed off to the post office . newline newline he wrote  return to sender  and sent it off to whoever wrote it . newline newline nikki , the girl who wrote the letter got it a few days later . she was surprised to note that nothing was missing , except for the pink notecard she put inside the envelope . in its place was a postit note . it said this : newline newline dear your secret admirer ,  newline newline i m gay . also , i caught you on camera . i m calling the cops .  newline newline love , john newline newline approximately one day later , nikki was arrested . you need coffee ,  my wife said , sipping on the fresh cup she had poured just moments before . newline newline  no ! damn ,  i said , rushing down , realizing i had already been close to twenty minutes late for work  i had lost track of time trying to finish the deed . newline newline  daddy ,  my daughter said , grabbing my left leg .  why you so angry , daddy ?  newline newline  elise ,  i yelled .  can you please take my daughter away from me  she smells like complete shit .  newline newline  i really do nt like this side of you ,  she told me .  just leave honestly .  newline newline the fuck was her problem . whatever . it did nt matter . what really mattered was why i was on the freeway and every single car was blaring their fucking horn . newline newline ten minutes passed . twenty minutes passed . thirty minutes passed and i m still on the fucking freeway . newline newline  someone fucking move , please !  i yelled out of my car window . newline newline somebody yelled back .  sit . your ass . down .  newline newline this went on for way too long . newline newline fifteen minutes later i was at work . newline newline  where is your fucking assignment , willis ?  my boss angrily asked me when i got here . newline newline i exploded .  maybe , i d have it done if you fucking gave me more than 24 hours to do this shit .  newline newline  you re fired .  newline newline  good .  i was done with this shitass job anyway . newline newline i drove home , and found a letter on my counter .  i took amy and went to my parent s house .  newline newline  whatever ,  i sighed . i opened my browser to pornhub , and tried to do the deed again . newline newline  why . is . this . shit . not working ! ! ! ! !  newline newline foolish are those who believe that masturbation does not make the world go round .as we huddled together in warmth of the sex we just experienced she talked about how we first met . i remember that day ... it was three years ago . i was at a small get together with some friends and some people i did nt know . i was nt a huge social branch , neither were my friends  the occasion of the night was the dvd release of hitch hikers guide to the galaxy . it was nt something you would see any girls at ... but my buddy had met a girl in the library she had come over , she also invited a friend . i remember the first time i saw her , standing there , she was cute . she was wearing a skirt , had long messy dirty blond hair , her sweater was slightly to big for her , and she was wearing converse . i was staring at her , hoping she would nt notice me ... . but as our eyes met she , she smiled . her smile was moving . the smile that sets your heart ablaze , the smile that your rarely see the first time meeting someone . i remember smiling back , which i rarely do  my smile was crooked , my knees were bent , i often slouched , i bit my finger nails , and i picked my nose when i was hoping no one was looking . i was nt the most confident person , i certainly would nt be the one to put myself up to talking to her so i continued to hide on the other side of the room  near the snacks . as the movie started , everyone engaged with it . i stood , awkwardly , near the edge of the couch hovering over everyone . every other scene that took place my eyes would slowly wonder to this woman , this girl that i thought was so beautiful . her laugh was great to watch , it filled me with joy seeing her smile . people would poke fun at her , she snorted when she laughed , but i loved it . newline newline as the movie started to slow down for a second i made my way back to the snacks , i was slightly hungry . someones hand had moved for the grapes , and i followed the arm from the fingers up to the head , it was her . i was in awe , speechless , as she stared at me and smiled . i was so nervous as i a war waged within my head about saying something , but something was different this time . i uttered something , i do nt know what i said ... but i said something . my mind was cracking into pieces , i messed up . conflicted i turned back to the food , my heart sinking . newline newline when suddenly i heard a beautiful voice speak out ,  i m good , how are you ?  i must have not messed up ! picking my heart up i dusted it off . then i said back ,  i m great , my friend invited me over . i like this movie , and the book was great too . how s the movie for you ?  she told me about how she had never read the book , i stared into her eyes . she also told me how she was liking the movie and how she liked the jokes , i still stared into her eyes . to be honest i can hardly remember our conversation , i was so hypnotize by her eyes , and her smile that i could nt recall a single thing i laughed at or she said . but by the end of the night i somehow ended with a new number in my phone , daph .  i did nt know if i would ever talk to her again , i was nt exactly the one to seek another person out . newline newline but she seemed to be the person who would seek me out . she started texting me , firting with me . i was a better texter than i was talker , i could write anything but say nothing . she started trying to get me to come places with her , i did , it was fun . we often would watch movies , we would watch anything together  from stuff like rocky horrer picture show , spirited away , xmen , up , i am legend , and star wars . we both loved movies , and we both seemed to like each others company a lot . newline newline after about a two months of watching movies alone together , we kissed . it was pretty weird , both our first kisses , but we connected . after that things started moving . we started moving  holding hands , hugging , snuggling , and kissing for hours . every time i kiss her till this day connects my heart with hers , its a feeling that i had never had , and a feeling that would never leave me . i was in love , she was in love , but we still danced around the term love . its not that we did nt know what we were doing , it was just so hard to say that word to someone for the first time . but it started sneak out of our mouths here and there . newline newline about six months into our relationship , we were watching lord of the rings . we were both huddled into a tent the i had set up in my living room . it was romantic , or silly but fun . i loved holding her next to me . she would hug me , make me feel no fear . we would kiss every hour , but the movies were so great that most of the time spent was spent hugging , and with our eyes glued to the television screen . as the first movie came to an end i lifted by body on top of hers , kissing her deeply . the was the closest i had gotten to a sexual adventure , and the closest she had gotten to an adventure of her own . as we slid our pants off we had no clue what we were doing ... i did nt have protection , i never needed it before . so we stopped , but wanted to continue . i needed to , we needed to . newline newline i threw on some pants , and i ran to the nearest store . she stayed in the tent , keeping our bed warm and safe . i bought my first box of condoms , and not the last box i would buy . it was awkward at first , i felt like peoples eyes were on me as i stepped up to the plate . i pulled out my wallet and threw the sides open . i saw my total and waited for my change , i did nt want the lose change , i just wanted my bills and my box . i felt so cool ... i was about to lose my virginity to a girl , and i was about to take her virginity . i felt like i was someone from a movie , the cool guy i wish i was . they guy with the leather coat , or howl from howls moving castle . it was magic . newline newline as i entered the room she looked excited . we had no experience doing this and it might have been the weirdest most awkward thing we had ever done together . looking back at it , it was sad ... i entered her , and she was really liking it i hope ? i know it felt great for me , but i finished in about 30 seconds . i know i was nt an olympic athlete when it came to sex , but could nt i do a little better than that ? newline newline the night moved on , we watched the rest of the movies and then we fell asleep talking about how great the adventures were , while embracing each other tightly . even if it was nt the best performance i felt as if we were closer . but i woke up to nothing , no one there . i was empty armed , and i felt so lonely . i just sat up thinking , if it was because of my poor performance . it was a little awkward after , i admit . but it was also kinda fun . while my mind was nervously racing to figure out my wrong doing , she walked in . and i stopped thinking ... she had the smile , the smile i first saw , the smile i loved , and the smile that threw my fears and thoughts away . newline newline after that everything started moving so fast . we were doing it like bunnies , literally . on some days we would do it twice a day , i was getting pretty good , or so i thought . she moved in with me and everything was great . she was my best friend , and i was hers . she was what i wanted to do at the end of the day . she was who i wanted to fall asleep with . she was everything to me  we would study and dream together , we both wanted to travel , neither of us wanted kids , and we both wanted to own a business of some type at some point . doors started to open for me , i started to come out of my shell and i have her to thank . she was my everything . newline newline that brings us to this day , as we layed in bed no worries in the world . we had never fought , or even got tired of each other . it was strange being so close to someone . i had never ever been this close to anyone . i never wanted to lose her . i thanked her for my success , she was the reason in my mind i was successful . she believed in me ... newline newline but as she spoke she sounded sad , bringing me through the days of our relationship . bring me to all the worriless , fun , great times we had . our relationship was prefect . that s when she told me ,  i m moving on .  i broke inside . i was scared , sad , lonely . all within that one instance . she continued her thoughts out loud . telling me how she needed to find herself . all i could think about was how i went wrong , what was wrong with me . my thoughts made me sadder and sadder . but they settled at the bottom , with my heart . the bottom of my soul where all i could squeak to my brain was ,  i lost my best friend , and my soul mate .  she continued telling me how it was nt my fault , i did nt hear it , i just cried inside . as she got up to leave , she had already packed her things ... i did nt see the signs . i hugged her good bye , and she left . newline newline it was empty in the house , i was nt around . she took my soul with her . i stopped going out . people did nt see me as much . i kept my job , but was only doing the required work . without her i was nothing . without her my heart was empty . with out her my house was just a bunch of furniture wrapped in air . she left me , she was my best friend , and my soul mate . i had nothing without her , and the home became a house  an empty shell of what it once was ... note , i have auditorytactile synesthesia so that s what i m going with , no pretty colors sorry  newline newline the piece begins with smooth pressure along your calves , the pressure slowly increases and shifts to your shins and ankles as light pinpricks dance along your shoulders . as the pinpricks slide into feathers and the leg pressure shifts forward and back fingers tap your chest with force , starting at your sternum and adding your collar to the mix . at this point things step up a notch , your fists clench and unclench while air blows on your face , the pressure on your legs spreads to cover both shin and calf and begin moving up your thighs , the pressure oscilating in time with the feathers brushing your shoulders , the tapping on your chest increasing to a rapid stacatto . newline newline the complexity increases continually as the song progresses , broad massaging pressure alongside various sharp and soft points going from head to toe and back while the soles of your feet slap against stone floor and heat blooms in your chest , the sensations a controlled chaos that straddles the line between enjoyment and discomfort , stepping over with grit between your teeth so that when it steps back to arms wrapped around you the difference seems greater and the lips against yours softer . newline newline the crescendo builds , fingers grip your hair and qtips swirl in your ears while a fist rapidly raps against your ribs and your feet slide down a sandy hill , hot and cold vie for control of your stomach and then suddenly newline newline a tickling finger slides from your tailbone to your atlas bone , goosebumps erupting along your ribs as it goes and liquid heat spills along your tongue . newline newline the song is over and fingertips drum your temple while you bow . newline newline  sorry if this is nt what you were looking for , hope you enjoyed it either way  one million years ?  newline newline  yes ,  he says .  but after that , you are guaranteed a spot in heaven .  newline newline  humanity wo nt last a million years .  i rolled my eyes at the stranger and snatched up the coin . newline newline  if you think that means an end to heaven and hell , then by all means , take your chances .  newline newline  a million years , man . that s not even close to reasonable . this whole situation does nt even make sense !  i turned the coin over and over in my hand , suddenly hesitant . newline newline  it s pretty reasonable considering the life you lived on earth . we debated your actions , and decided it all might as well come down to a toss up . thou shalt not kill is a pretty big deal around here . however , so is an eye for an eye .  he shrugged .  we thought a coin toss fitting .  newline newline i sighed . i almost laughed . we d all thought about this moment before , even sung about it . my boys and i had marched to it , run to it , and discussed it over many , many beers . newline newline when i get to heaven newline newline saint peter gon na sayayy newline newline how d you earn your living boy newline newline how d you earn your payayy newline newline i replied with a whole lot of anger newline newline i made my living as an airborne ranger newline newline when i get to heell newline newline the devil s gon na sayayy newline newline how d you earn your living boy newline newline how d you earn you payayy newline newline i replied with a boot to his cheest newline newline i made my living putting souls to reest !  newline newline i took a deep breath and flipped the coin . i d be having a conversation soon no matter which way the damn thing landed .thanks for sharing , this was a solid read . i was a little distracted by the writing at first  i found it vocabulary heavy and it did nt seem natural to me . there were a few times i felt a more common word would have been the better choice . i found myself pausing a couple of times debating the merits of a particular word choice . newline newline i also agree with heyfignuts that the story moved very rapidly in parts . i also wanted to know more about alexander s story . how did he get transported through time ? was it divine intervention ? why on a meteor ? newline newline all that aside , it was an entertaining read . i enjoyed the concepts behind the story and thought this was a good piece . good luck !it started with the cattle . unsurprisingly , the first reported case was in a weterinarian s log a farmer reporting the bloated body of his prized heifer in the back of her paddock . most notably , her skin had turned blue under her coat . several days later , another case was reported by the farmer s neighbor . later , scientists would trace the progression of the disease by following wind patterns the disease moved downwind . cattle began dying all over the countryside . in droves . there were no symptoms of illness , no indicators of predisposition to disease . old , young , healthy , it did nt matter . farmers would wake up in the mornings and find entire herds had perished in the night . newline newline meat production came to a screeching halt , but it was too late . the first human case was reported a month after the first bovine case . newline newline wictims said they felt slightly fatigued at first , and shortly after would get bruisecolored rings under their eyes . as the disease progressed , the wictim s extremities would also begin to turn blue . death occurred about 12 hours after the appearance of the rings . newline newline  it s a wirus !  they said . newline  you must not wisit your loved ones ! you will catch the wirus !  newline  it is silent , like the shadows , and like your shadow , you can not escape it .  said others . newline newline the blue shadow wirus flowed on the winds through the countryside , eventually making it to a major city . people fleeing the spread of the disease carried it with them on airplanes , boats and trains , infecting their fellow passengers . within a year of the first report , there were not enough people left to bury the dead . within five years , there was no one left at all . newlinewhy did i have to be born like this ? newline newline the order of light held power over the land . rich , fertile land that could support many . through this , they flourished , building cities and driving out those that they deemed undesirable  which was just about everything that was nt human . we were the outliers , a ragtag group whose sole purpose was to give the order of light an enemy . we could nt stand up to their armies  what good were heavy wooden clubs against mithril shields ? instead , we nibbled on their prosperity , taking what little we could against the sparselydefended border towns . newline newline our leader had found a nice cave in a nearby mountain . we stashed our nearlyrotten plunder in it , splitting it as best as we could . our race could breed at a speed that was comparable to mice , but such a blessing came with an equally heavy curse  rarely did we have enough to provide for our young . out of the eight or so children born to a mother at a time , she counted herself lucky if three survived long enough to utter their first words . supplies almost always went to the children who showed the most promise  after the workers were fed , of course . newline newline i stepped out into the sunlight , the wind carrying the last remnants of the terrifying storm that had drenched the region last night . the footing today would be far more treacherous than normal , as the rocks were just beginning to dry out . i heard the laughter of children , further up the trail . normally , the children were allowed to explore , but the rains had left everything a wet , slippery mess . i pressed upwards , heedless of the messy footprints i left behind me in the mud . newline newline  you kids should nt be out and about !  i yelled . the three children  old enough to know better , but too young to lift a club , giggled and ran up the mountain . i followed the tattered , dirtbrown shirt of the slowest one , up the peak . they paused at the boulder , before crawling over it like three small green spiders . newline newline  get down from there !  i yelled . they responded with giggles . the largest of the three , who stood just past my waist , bounced on the imposing rock . a small path wound up around the large rock . i slowly made my way up to the kids . my foot slid out from under me , and i grabbed at handfuls of dirt , then a branch to keep myself from falling . as i righted myself , i felt a low rumble from the ground . the children jumped off of the boulder , and laughed as it slowly rolled down from its resting place . newline newline  that s enough playing , we re going home now !  the largest one shook his head . newline newline  you made big rock fall . you bad !  the two behind him crossed their arms , no doubt mirroring what their mothers did when they got in trouble . newline newline  i was nt the one that hopped up and down on it !  i retorted . all three of them stuck their tongues out at me , then pointed to the falling boulder . newline newline the lone boulder smashed through trees and other rocks , loosened by the rain . what started as a single rolling stone became an avalanche , which flowed down the mountain . a neatlylined block of shining objects , which had been headed for the mountain , broke into a mess of light points , which in turn was swallowed by the debris . newline newline  no more light ! no more light !  the smallest one yelled , jumping up and down in excitement . newline newline  how am i going to explain this ?  i lamented , as i herded the children back home . newline newline   newline newline from the rubble , we salvaged many helmets , shields , suits of armor , and weapons . from the mage we captured on that fateful day , we learned the secrets of magic . with metal and magic , we carved our own country . for those who wish to escape the order of light , we welcome them . for those that mean us harm , i , leelam rockskin , the first kobold earth mage , will call upon the mountain s might , just as i did those many years ago . since you were with him for the final ten years of his life , we felt you would capture his rise and fall the best . so what do you have to say for him ?  i asked to the mysterious man in the dark . newline newline  you wan na know about him for your obituary ? well , well , you know your research tactics . so what do you want to know ?  the man said . newline newline  i do nt know , anything .  i said . newline newline  well , he was married to the beautiful ms. alice thames for five years prior to his rise . his children were the cutest things i had ever seen . anyway , we met in a bar down in the bronx . he was having a nice night out on the town , a great guy with a nice smile and good hair . me and him became instant friends . we had so many ideas and so many connections that it was ridiculous . but then i ... uh ... i ... well , let s just say i have certain skills that help people out . and i used those skills to help grant a wish of marvin s . this began a rise that was sudden and awe inspiring . he became the ceo of the world s largest company . as you know , he quickly became the most powerful man in the world . things took a turn when he met the stunning etta lamb . they met day and night to talk , go out , and of course do things to each other that i should nt say . but of course , ms. thames was displeased by this and left him . this event left him saddened for about a day until he thought of proposing to ms. lamb . so i used my skills , to arrange a nice ring for ms. lamb . they became happily married and had a child together . meanwhile , the government had looked into his business and found that the money did nt add up . the feds decided to launch a full scale investigation . and what would you know it , he was thrown in jail . after 6 years , i found him once again on the streets . he was sitting on the corner of broadway . the irony of seeing him dirty and disheveled with lights and glamor behind him was quite a sight . he asked for my skills one more time . so i gave him what he requested , a bottle of the finest bourbon and a gold , fullyloaded revolver . i turned around and found his brain splattered on the sign for the book of mormon musical . i carried his body to the police and now here i am . talking to a reporter like you for an obituary for a man who does nt deserve it .  the man said . newline newline i stood there shocked . i dropped my pen on the floor midway through . it was such an intriguing story . but what  skills  was he referring to ? newline newline  so um , the obvious question is , what are your skills .  i asked . newline newline he stood , snapped his fingers , and a bottle of jack daniels appeared in the corner . i was stunned . there was no way he could be what i thought he was . newline newline  are you a ... a genie ?  i asked . newline newline he chuckled and with another snap he was gone . i looked around and there was no sign of him . i grabbed the bottle of jack in the corner and took a drink . i heard a snap and looked behind me . the man said ,  you have 2 more wishes . he looked up at her beautiful face . dark curls framing a porcelain white face with bright crimson lips . those lips parted and she spoke .  your punishment is finally over , michael .  she said . newline newline he looked around . it all looked like every image he d ever seen of heaven . fluffy clouds to walk on , everyone with wings , carrying harps . he looked at the beauty in front of him and she continued to speak ,  michael , what you experienced as earth was merely a device created by god as a type of hellish limbo for souls who had committed misdeeds in their previous existence . now you are in the realm of peace and prosperity .  newline newline michael started to think . he realized all the bodily aches and pains , needs and wants had faded away and he was left feeling satisfied . he no longer felt the need to compare himself to those around him , he felt good enough as any person around him and filled with a steady pulsing happiness . newline newline  michael ,  the angelic woman figure spoke ,  your life here will be everything you could imagine  newline newline  thank you  said michael . newline newline michael saw that this heavenly place was full of all the things people could desire , food , beautiful women , comfortable places to sleep , lovely music , pleasing art , and much more . he smiled with the realization that his earthy pains were over and he could look forward to a new peaceful existence . he began to recognize some of the faces of the people who had been kindest to him on his time on earth and he felt happy . we do nt have enough power here , it is nt stable , shut it down .  he said clearly disappointed leaving his lab in his basement . dr. hopkins had been trying to find the well kept secret of time travel . solid state inc was basically the size of your average country , the governmental force in control of time travel for the free united countries of terra , wrapped up in a neat corporate package . since the invention of the first time travel device , solid state inc has strived to keep time travel out of the public s hands as they figured out how it worked . dr. hopkins used to work for a contracting research and development company called proxima r  d . solid state had hired his team to solve the energy problems when creating and sustaining a worm hole . his team had figured out that the most sustainable way to keep a worm hole open was in space harnessing solar power in earth s orbit . the scientists were paid and released from their contract after this breakthrough . little did hopkins know at the time , that he and his team had created a global super power . solid state had it s defectors like any large power , and it soon leaked out what the corporations were trying to accomplish . eventually they built a space station carrying the most advanced super computer ever constructed . along with the first time travel device , that would open a worm hole and travel back to a few seconds after the point the researchers initiated the super computer providing them with near instantaneous answers to mathematical equations that would take at least a decade without the worm hole . a stable paradox if such a thing exists . solid state launched the people of earth into the future essentially over night . this was no utopian society though . oppressed by tyrannical corporate states and forced into your one size fits all life , but dr. hopkins had plans to change everything . newline continue ?a man chooses , a pokemon obeys . newline newline at least that s what they tried to tell me . heh . newline newline in my first moments of awareness , i found myself in some mechanical suit , soaked in what seemed like a liquid that smelt like the noxious fumes from a wheezing . but i could not move , and the fumes i breathed in somehow made me feel ... .. alive . newline newline eventually , i grew to hear voices , that i came to recognise as other beings outside of my suit . they talked about things like dna , mew , domination , though all i really wanted was to escape the immobilisation . newline newline it was about a week before i was freed from my capsule . free from the noxious liquid , but still trapped in my suit . they told me that i was their ultimate creation , and that i would serve as their weapon to conquer the world . newline newline i was puzzled . newline newline they commanded me to attempt some tests , but i refused to budge . and that s when it began  the suit i was trapped in shocked me . the agony was shocking , the pain intense . newline newline and so i had no choice but to obey . to move objects with sheer willpower , to read the intentions of my test subjects . the barrage of tests were pushing the limits of my mind , and i suffered greatly . yet , it felt oddly empowering . newline newline there were other pokemon around . they looked upon me with a haunting sadness , but obeyed every order with a resigned sigh . newline newline i could not understand  they were capable of feats that the humans were unable of . breathing fire , producing electricity  why were they acting like servants ? and then it dawned on me  as i was trapped by my shock suit , they most definitely enslaved by some unseen nefarious means . newline newline and then it happened . newline newline they wanted me to kill another pokemon . i had resisted some of their previous tests , but the shock suit held the upper hand . this time , i simply could not give in . taking the life of a fellow slave ? their audacity ! newline newline the shock increased , my agony knew no bounds . i struggled to keep my mind under control , but i lost it . newline newline in the blink of an eye , my suit exploded in all directions . newline newline i was free . free of the shock suit , free of the control . my abilities were free to use , and i smirked as i used my mind to rip my captors asunder . newline newline you all remember why the captain of the guard decided to grace us with his presence , do you not ?  newline newline 20 men and women stood at attention , in a straight line , shoulder to shoulder . they all saluted in unison .  yes , sir !  newline newline the governor sneered .  and what may that reason be ?  newline newline i stepped in the room through the hatch , laughing silently . i put a finger up to my lips to shush the guys , then silently stepped behind the governor .  please , do tell me why i m here ,  i said nonchalantly , drawing myself up to my full eight feet and resting my elbow on the governor s head . newline newline the governor laughed . it was not a nice laugh . he cackles like a maniac . twerp .  it is his last day with you . he turns three hundred and fifty tomorrow .  newline newline i thought for a moment . yes , the law did state that no person may live more than 350 years . immortality on a large scale is a terrible idea . no , i was not turning 350 years old . nor did i particularly care about what the law said . i was the captain . so i held up one of my twin shotguns to the guy s face .  i do not turn three hundred and fifty tomorrow , i m afraid . nor is today my last day with you guys . what you may not know , my dear governor , is that i am turning 5,000 in half a minute from ...  i checked the clock on the wall .  now . also , you ve ruined my day.would you mind being the one kicked out of that airlock today instead of me ?  newline newline the governor shook with rage .  you are a danger to the city . you must be eliminated .  newline newline i nodded sadly .  yes . i ve only run the city parttime for the past four thousand years . the rest i spent learning how to do cool shit like teleportation .  i disappeared and reappeared on his other side .  and still we ve prospered .  i waved my shotgun around , making everyone wince .  i ve defended this place with 20 random people who did nt even volunteer , most of who could nt even do a single fucking pushup when i started with them , since the establishment of the city , with zero casualties .  newline newline  i will bring you to justice ,  he spat . newline newline  i will kill you by shoving you out that airlock and into the wormhole ,  i retorted . everyone knew that only heavily reinforced spacecraft could pass through . then , for extra measure , i added :  with a space suit .  newline newline  you would nt dare .  newline newline i crossed my arms .  try me .  newline newline right before he could respond , i shoved and oxygen mask on his face , and he went through the hatch . i watched him quickly recede into the distance . newline newline i looked up . the twenty members of the guard were aghast .  oh , do nt worry . this happens about every 75 years or so . i m used to it . same shit every time .  they were still staring at me .  look , it s not a big deal . drinks on my ship at ohfivehundred ?  hesitantly , the group cheered . newline newline good . i would nt have to put too much work into erasing all those memories . and maybe i could get some feedback about those horns i was planning for my next identity . so ... have you ever considered having extra marital relationships with other people ? maybe visit a swinger club to heat things up a bit in the bedroom ? it is perfectly natural that people have , well , certain desires that can not be met by their long term spouses .  newline newline my hands , previously trying to underline my words with miniscule gestures , formed a little tent as i slowly leaned back into my comfortable leather armchair and waited for the inevitable to unfold . newline newline  you mean ... like , a threeway ?  newline newline susan seemed reluctant to take the bait , her eyes were fluttering about the room nervously and her tongue was moving around restlessly in her closed mouth , as if trying to remove a bad flavour . newline newline  just to name one possibility , yes . there are all kind of things one can attempt when it comes to this specific field . it can be very healthy to leave one s comfort zone every now and again .  newline newline any second now , anthony would make his biggest mistake . he would express interest in the proposal , his eyes would glint with lust , and susan would never forget the time he admitted to desiring other women sexually . keeping the smirk from my face seemed to get more difficult with every passing second . newline newline  do nt forget , this is a safe environment , if you ca nt express your innermost selves here and compromise together , then where can you ?  newline newline i kept pushing on , doing my darndest to underline my words with harmless puppy eyes . newline newline but it was susan , again , who broke the silence . newline newline  we have been doing that for years . it is an integral part of our relationship , and to be frank , anthony and i are getting rather bored of it .  newline newline anthony nodded , agreeingly . perfectly genuine , too . newline newline  yeah , it has lost its charm . has gotten pretty dull by now , really .  newline newline shocked , i realised that those two would be my hardest customers . for years now had i been working hand in hand with the local divorce attorneys , always receiving a generous cut once i transferred a couple from counseling to one of their offices . but mr. and mrs. finnigan would give me a hell of a hard time . newline newline desperately , i tried to collect my thoughts and remember all the psychological weapons at my disposal , trying to find out which one might do the trick . newline newline  is it true that you , susan , wanted to have children when you were freshly married , but anthony refused ? even though that he had previously stated that he , too , wanted kids ?  newline newline anthony smiled , a big , happy grin . newline newline  that s accurate , doc . but to be fair , around that time , my older brother , dave , had just had his first child . everything he told me made me realise that having kids would only complicate our extraordinary relationship .  newline newline  i have come to agree with him on that point after the first time we had to take care of our little nephew tommy for a week . it was hell . when his parents came to pick him up after their short vacation , they looked like someone had just sucked all happiness out of their lives . dave picked him up , and with the look he had on his face , i could swear he was contemplating on dropping him to the ground and running off .  newline newline both of them broke out in honest , warm laughter . newline newline  poor dave !  newline newline newline i was baffled . this could nt be happening ! why in the name of all that can be bought with cold , hard cash did these people even seek out counseling in the first place ? ! i was at the end of my wits . five sessions . five soul crushing , time wasting sessions with the finnigans , and they seemed stronger together than your average last5minutesofromcommovie couple . newline newline i hated them . newline newline newline i hated them more than i could express in words . newline newline newline  why exactly did you come to my office ? you stated you had some problems , but you never elaborated . for five weeks now have i tried to figure out what s wrong with your relationship and how we could possibly , uhm , fix this . but i do nt even see the issue here !  newline newline there was a very noticeable sound of desperation in my voice , i could hear it . the gestures of my hands , usually calm , seemed to be more fitting for a madman as i wrung and shook my arms around . newline newline the finnigans exchanged a glance , then looked at me , bemusement and maybe just a touch of pity in their happy , beady little evil , evil eyes . newline newline god how i hated them . newline newline  well , i do nt know if calling it a problem in the first place was too accurate . there are nt any issues , really . we were merely trying to find ways to further improve our relationship . we re happier than ever , but we just wanted to find possibilities to increase our love and affection for one another . we thought you might have some good ideas or would be able to help ?  newline newline that was the last straw . newline newline i jumped from my chair , eyes bulging out of my head , spittle coming from the corners of my mouth . newline newline  get the fuck out of my office , you insufferable shitheads !  newline newline they looked scared now . if only i could have seen my face in that moment , i m sure i would have been , too . newline newline  out ! out ! oooouuut !  newline newline newline newline ... newline newline and that , my friends , is how i lost my license to perform as a couple s counselor , my business partners and most of my money . my life is a living hell now , it seems almost impossible to make ends meet , and what for ? only so a couple of people might stay married and die together , happily , after years of treasured companionship ? newline newline pah ! fuck them ! newline newline newline newline newline god , how i hate those finnigans !what defines a god . unlimited power ? the ability to create or destroy anything at will ? the ability to impose one s will upon all of creation ? dr. fields had all of these at his fingertips with this device . months of tinkering had gone by to reach this moment . ash covered diagrams and the smell of ozone filled his study . the result : a coat with gloves . newline newline he placed it on himself . energy surged through his being as the suit worked its mechanical magic . fields fell to the ground in agony , and saw his precious diagrams burst into flames as he blacked out . newline newline he never awoke , but he was conscious nonetheless . he looked , as best he could , but could see nothing but blackness . for days , it was darkness . he wished for some light , and suddenly there appeared a small speck of light . the light grew seemingly infinitely , enveloping him and his surroundings . newline newline he stared as the light settled into a vast network , and recognition appeared across his face . newline newline  let there be light he was 68  if my height chart by the door was anything to go by . dressed in what i call ranger classic  : full leathers brushed in shades of charcoal and greens , a bow that looks like it needs a team to string , a beard that looked it was kept trimmed with a machete and a wolfhound that looks like it had tiger somewhere in its ancestry . newline newline he had a sack that stank of animal parts and clanked with metal when he put it on the table . newline newline  hello sir ,  i tried to say while not breathing through my nose . if there was nt a dead skunk in that bag i was going to have to revise my stance on my service sign outside : no shoes , no shirt , no bath , no service  . newline newline he said nothing , but handed out what appeared to be a business card . it was handwritten and i reread it twice  there was no punctuation or capitalization of any kind . newline newline ranger dan and his big dog dick  newline newline i subvocalized a supplication to the gods of profanity . it was going to be one of these days . newline newline  alright , ranger , what do you have for me ?  newline newline he opened the bag and my eyes stung a little . he pulled out the usual trash , old armor which was dangling more by hardpacked mold than leather . a couple of daggers and one gauntlet . who the hell pawns one gauntlet ? it did resemble one that had been brought in yesterday bound for the middens , so i might be able to salvage a pair . there were also freshly skinned pelts , a large container of what i can only surmise was rendered fat . there was a word there ... tollfet ? oh wait , it s troll fat ... they ll let anyone be a ranger these days . newline newline to my surprise he had a few apparently valuable things in the bag : a bowcase with an actual bow inside that looked far better than the one he was carrying and three jeweled rings that glowed faintly with magic . he looked kind of smug as he laid these out . newline newline i lugged out my official tomes of magical identification to look out for maker s marks and thieve s hexes common to most contemporary magical items of the day . the markings on the bow indicated this was an old familial bow of elven ancestry . a good sum on resale if the line is dead . swift death or a princely sum at ransom if alive . if i d wager anything , this bow was indeed leagues better than the large old thing on his back . it would outlast him and his grandkids , if he were smart enough to have them . newline newline i was suspicious . did he rob some elven family and mixed it in with the junk to fool me ? was he undercover for the king rooting out crooked laundering operations ? was he just an idiot who got lucky scavenging ? why was nt he talking ? what the hell is going on here ? newline newline ranger dan merely shifted from one leg to another , same expression on his face . big dog dick ... or was it big dog dick ... merely yawned . newline newline not wanting to tip my hand of what i knew just yet , i went about looking at the rings . mostly i was hoping to get a more clear picture of his intentions , but he was about as emotive as a stone . newline newline it took a bit of searching but i finally located their entry . it was quadrilogy of rings , made to project illusions for a specific stage play about the riddle of the sphinx . the three stages of man and the monster itself ... let s see , there s the swaddling ring for the baby ... the wizened ring for the old man ... there s the monster ... where ... another supplication to the profanity gods . newline newline  timothy weedle duvala ... i know it s you under that warrior illusion ring . what the hell are you doing wasting my time ?  newline newline the man began to sweat , still not saying anything , he shrugged his shoulders at me . you could pour the tension in the air on flapjacks as we both knew the game was up . newline newline the next events took place over the course of about 10 seconds . another customer entered the shop , ringing the bell . the giant wolfhound yelped newline in an entirely highpitched unwolfhoundlike manner . the man vanished , in his place was little timmy weedle : the halfelf son of a deposed former tuathan lord and the bane of my existence . he grabbed what i now knew must be his father s bowcase , yelled  big dog dick !  and ran out with what i could only surmise was his new puppy . newline newline i yelled yet more vocal supplications to the profanity gods as he dashed by a rather surprised guardsman and disappeared down the street . kids and their stupid pranks . newline newlinei am cold , and in a dark cell . beside me , my cat thompson sleeps . below me , an evil does as well . even now , i can hear his words , those awful words , those evil words . newline newline  have you no honor ?  newline varet looked close to murder , though his eyes were also clouded with confusion . this was the first time i had ever told the team to stop digging . perhaps to him , it seemed unjustified . after all , what danger could be left from the old ones ? but now i know the meaning of the sacred prophecies . there are places without honor . this is one . newline newline  lock him up . we dig !  newline newline they carried me off , like some common criminal . at first , i shouted warnings , tried to get them to stop . but they did nt heed me . then , i begged them to stop . but they did not heed me . i can hear the drills strike steel , and the shouts of triumph . they will all die , and i will join them . at least i have thompson for some light to read by .it was a wet day in october , on the eastern shore of loch nornin , that i saw her the first time . she trudged along the edge of the lake , stopping every now and then to crouch down on the shore . at the time i thought nothing of it  just a girl in a blue parka , collecting rocks . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  four years passed before we went to scotland on vacation again , i was fourteen at the time . my dad rented the same lodge as the time before . it was built in the forties in the aftermath of the war and had served as a refuge for disabled veterans before it was turned into a charityhousing in the nineties . and by that , i mean that the money for the rent went directly to a charity for the disabled . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  say what you will about my dad  he was a bit unpolished and something of a drunk ever since my mom died in leukemia  but he always had a sense of honor . and while there were nicer cottages around the large lake , he always picked this one  the one with the leaking roof and a shower without hot water . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  my brother and i were by the lake , jumping between the jagged rocks that jutted out of the trembling surface when i saw the girl in blue for the second time . i remember my brother nudging my shoulder and asking what was wrong . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   that girl ,  i said .  i think i saw her when we were here four years ago.  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   who ?  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   her !  i said , pointing . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  my brother nodded , his face was expressionless . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   i guess , i didn  t expect to see her here again , that  s all ,  i said . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   she  s probably a local ,  my brother said , shrugging . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   if she is local ,  i pressed on .  how come she is here by the lake , collecting rocks every time we  re here ? i mean , how many rocks do you need ?  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   whatever , dude ,  my brother said , hugging himself .  i  m cold , let  s go inside.  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i hated when he called me  dude.  you don  t call your fourteenyearold sister  dude ,  that just doesn  t make any sense . i don  t remember if i ever told him that i didn  t like it . all i know is that i was clenching my fists in my pockets as we went back to the lodge . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  another four years passed , and with them , my dad and brother . my dad  s liver couldn  t take any more abuse , and my brother was on that train that got blown up by those bombers . it  s strange  you don  t really think the tragedies and violence in the world are real until they affect you personally  at least that  s how i felt until i was suddenly alone . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  times were hard economically as well  my dreams of becoming a writer weren  t exactly bearing fruit . i worked odd jobs and occasionally had stories published in local papers and magazines  the pay of which wasn  t anywhere near what i needed to write fulltime . it wasn  t working out the way i had planned , but i decided to give it one final go . one finished novel before giving up for good on writing  that was my plan . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i sold my apartment in london and took the train up to scotland . i rented the same lodge that my dad always did , by loch nornin  sentimentality , i guess . three months  that was the time limit i set for myself . it was october again when i arrived at the lake . the citrus fruit colors of the forest were mirrored in the gray water , and a mountain range loomed in the hazy distance . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  my eyes found their way to the shore where the girl in a blue parka was slowly strolling along , every now and then bending down to pick up a rock . what was she doing with those rocks ? despite everything that had happened in my life since i last saw her  i still couldn  t wrap my head around it , and felt a surging need to solve the mystery . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  that night , when i sat down in the small kitchen of the lodge to write , with the incessant dripping from the leak in the background , my mind wandered to the girl in the blue parka again . i looked out the window over the dark expanse of the lake . a tiny light from a lantern bobbed along the shoreline  sometimes stopping and lowering itself . the first page of my novel was still blank , but i needed to know . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i put on some warm clothes , grabbed a lantern , and hurried out in the trickling rain . whistling winds carried across the lake , pushed and snatched at me . i felt the icy rain roll down my face as i approached the lantern . waves splashed against the rocks and i had to be careful not to slip and hurt myself . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   hey ! excuse me ,  i cried , to drown out the noise of the waves and the patter of the rain .  what are you doing out here ?  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i was close enough now to see the blue outline of her parka in the light of the lantern . i caught her face with the beam of my own lantern . she had sad brown eyes and her cheeks were rosy from the cold . i guess she was about my age . she lifted a hand to her face as a shield for the brightness . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   i  m just walking along the shore ,  she answered , her voice barely audible over the wind . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   why are you here collecting rocks ?  i burst out .  why ?  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   is it your rocks ?  she asked . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   no , but  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   then you won  t mind if i take some ?  she cut me off , clearly upset about my lack of courtesy . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   look , i  m sorry ,  i said .  but i  ve seen you here since i was ten . i just need to know what you  re doing with those rocks !  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i sounded crazy  stalkerlike almost  and i could see in her face that she wasn  t pleased with what she heard . she gave me a pitying look and then turned away and continued her journey along the shore . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   please wait !  i said , my voice cracking with pent up despair and grief .  please , i just need to know.  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  she was already quite a bit away . i sank to my knees , my hands burrowing into the cold wet pebbles . my lips formed the word  why ?  over and over but no sound came out . the tears that rolled down my cheeks were burning hot . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   why ?  i said , my fingers finding the smooth surface of a rock .  i don  t understand.  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i fished it up and opened my pocket . the blackness of the rock was striking against my blue parka . newline newline  newline if you liked this story , consider subscribing to rlilwadexel for more . newlineit was a normal day . i had just gotten home from school , and after a quick few texts between this girl i was hitting on , i proceeded to go to my second home : xbox live . newline newline xbox live has always been a home for me , specifically call of duty . i make videos online  trash talking  the other team after with voice messages . sometimes i trash talk because i wrecked them and they should recognize that i was tbagging them because they are bad , and sometimes i trash talk because they use cheap guns . i get it , how s there such thing as a  cheap gun ?  i m not even going to bother explaining . newline newline anyhow , yesterday was the same routine : get home , get on xbox . after a quick warmup in a private match , i was ready to stomp some public matches . the first game went really well , the other team sucked so i sent a few guys a couple of message detailing how i had fornicated with their older sisters . it was all good . the second game though , a new player joined the other team . his gamertag was  thanksobama  . in the last game he got 50 kills ! i was beyond pissed . he had to be cheating . after the game , as i was preparing to start a new game though , he sent me a message . it was as followed . newline newline  get fucking wrecked . ur gun skills are shit you bad kid , go cry to your mom  newline newline this guy was a professional . obviously he had seen my guides on how to trash talk on youtube . so i busted out my keyboard for my controller and began to type vigorously . eventually i came up with the following . newline newline  get fucking wrecked ? dude you blow at this game , you would have lost if the other team did nt support you .  newline newline i felt good . this was some quality trash talking . it needed something though . after a few seconds i added something i only use of special occasions . newline newline  1v1 me , you re so bad .  newline newline 2 minutes later , i was invited to play call of duty black ops on nuketown . it was a 1v1 , quickscopes only . this was certainly a fight that i was going to remember ... newline newline ... he beat me . he must have been cheating ! modded controller ? hacking script ? aimbot ? i may have lost , but i still had my trash talking . i quickly messaged him . newline newline  dude you re such a hacker . oh well , you re probably some no life . thanksobama ? what a stupid gt . hope you feel good about yourself , while you were playing , i was fucking your mom .  newline newline a minute later i received a party invite from none other than  thanksobama  . i joined the party , ready to flame his ears with some beautiful trash talking . he talked first , and what he said left me speechless . newline newline  i understand that you said you fucked my mom , but the truth is , i fucked your mom . hello son .  newline newline i was talking to the president of the united states .it was hard to tell who was the princess and who was the dragon . newline newline not for the first time that day , reis wished he had paid better attention to his mother . and that he was nt more than a little hungover . newline newline two women stood before him , of equal height and slender waists . the differences between them were all aesthetics . one had hair of deep violet , then other of sky blue . eyes of blue and eyes of green . fair and dark or dark and fair . newline newline looking at them made his head pound . a dragon s trick , reis was sure . newline newline he did nt have a picture of the princess to check against . he had lost his commlink on the trek up to the tower . mainly because it involved several skirmishes with the local flora . maneater flowers had taken root in the forest near the tower . a discovery he made while puking in the bushes . newline newline they had been waiting for him just past the foyer . and he had been staring for a couple minutes now , dripping plant slime onto the marble floor . newline newline the bluehaired girl rolled her eyes and the violet one sighed . newline newline reis , tired , undiplomatic reis , made a splitsecond decision . he drew his plasmaedged sword and chopped off the blue haired girl s head . newline newline violet sighed again . newline newline  that was the princess , you know ,  she said . newline newline reis gaped a bit at this . newline newline  but ... but she rolled her eyes at me .  newline newline  i did nt realize that was a killable offense now .  newline newline reis sheathed his sword . newline newline  congratulations ,  he said , pressing a hand to his temple ,  you ve just been made a princess ...  newline newline a small lifted the corner of her mouth . newline newline  and my wife .  newline newline the corner drooped , and her equally violet eyebrows scrunched together . newline newline this was the worst marriage his mother had arranged for him yet . newlinehave you ever heard the saying that a photograph captures a fragment of your soul ? well , it turned out to be true . as a hunter , i ve seen my fair share of fucked up pictures and disgusting homemade sextapes , but atleast i get to destroy them . they come back in various forms  some are phantoms , like the shit you d see in movies  ironically , an actor being a ghost in a movie could litteraly come back as a ghost because of the film  , some are ghouls , some are humanoid zombies who will run at you with olympic speeds with the intention to kill you . of course , there are variations of each species , but you get the idea . the one thing they ve got in common , though , is their absolute refusal to die , unless you ve destroyed every piece of evidence of their existence . you can strike a wraith down with a silver sword , or smash a ghoul to pieces , but they rarely stay dead more than two hours or so , before respawning near their phylactery . these can be pictures hanging on the wall , or a laptop with a harddrive containing pictures of them . newline newline why do they try to kill us , you ask ? well , it turns out dying is a traumatic experience that twists your mind . we still do nt know what lies beyond our death , and what kind of deity screws with our conscience once we go dark , but what we do know it s enough to spawn an urge to murder when you rise from the grave . newline newline now , we live in an apocalypse . restless spirits wander the streets at night , groaning . at dawn , the ghouls emerge from the subway tunnels , roaming in daylight , searching for prey . each kill spawns a new problem . us hunters , we re rare . not only because it takes a certain kind of fucked up individual to willingly go head first into battle with dead people , but also because of the lack of equipment available . believe it or not , silver weapons are not that common . i myself sport a silver knife , a gun with one bullet , a crossbow with silvertipped arrows , and a small hatchet , and a usb stick containing a single picture of myself . all others have been deleted . should i find myself in a sticky situation of impending doom , i simply break the usb in half and let it happen . newline newline that s my life , and the reality i live in . currently , i ve taken shelter in a church near a graveyard . are you insane , you think  but no , whilst a graveyard would be the worst place to be in a scenario where the dead rise , remember that they immediately go search for prey and respawn near their phylacteries . meaning , i m all alone in a wooden church , surrounded by a graveyard with more empty holes than a busy minefield . it s one of the safest places to be . newline newline tomorrow , i ll deal with the wraith terrorising a mansion of survivors . bet it s just an old painting in the basement . after this , there is no turning back . you take the blue pill , the story ends , you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe . you take the red pill , you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbithole goes . you take the blueyred pill and the story ends , but then a new story begins . you take the reddyblue pill and your story does nt end but a new one starts anyway . you take the blue pill with red stripes and your story does nt end , a new one starts anyway , and you can see someone else s story start . you take the red pill with curly blue lines and your story stops and starts again from the middle but runs backwards and a new story starts that you are nt involved in . you take the halfblue , half red pill and that s when things get complicated . your story has nt started and it wo nt , but everyone knows about it . another story you do nt know about yet starts and you join it later , but then leave again just as it gets interesting to end someone else s story . the sequel to your story then starts but is cancelled before the season finishes . you take the psychedelic red and blue pill and you die because you re allergic to chocolate . the villagers know we are here now . some of them have even begun bringing their children to see us , a rite of passage perhaps . they hide in the undergrowth just outside the clearing , disturbing the leaves just enough to give away their presence , big brown eyes glistening . when we come out of the cave , they ca nt hold back gasps of wonderment at the sight of two tall people , wrapped not in furs but in colourful fabrics  feet in boots , not hides tied with sinew . newline newline they keep their distance . they think we are spirits and are afraid to anger us . i find this a mixed blessing  after all these millennia on an earth empty of people , to have some of our own kind around us again ! to be held in the bosom of a community ! but we can never join their village . they are too different . it would nt be fair to them , for their gods to decide to live among them . newline newline it would also be dangerous to us . close contact with those not like us will erode our specialness , and eventually make us mortal . there is so much to live for , now ! when we look at these browneyed folk , camouflaged in the shrubbery , we know we are looking at the pyramids . the acropolis . chartres cathedral . samurai . machu picchu . the bible . hamlet . what a waste , to miss all that ! no , we will remain and bear witness to history . we will make our own community . newline newline there is also this to live for : i am pregnant at last ! we had begun to lose hope that it would ever be possible for us to have children . when our exile began , we were told that we would only occasionally be fertile . perhaps the nearness of other humans has brought it on ? whatever the reason for this blessing , we are thrilled . finally , we will be more than just two ! we will be a family , growing through the ages alongside the family of humanity . i wonder what history will say of us ? newline newline i wonder how these villagers will receive the information that there will soon be a third god living in the forest above their home ? newline newline  newline newline they are in the bushes again . perhaps they have brought some of our own children to see us this time . they are easily recognizable , taller , somewhat lighter of hair than the other villagers . and fatter . they receive the best food , the first choice of meat . my daughter , whom they named agathway but whom i named diana , is bent with age now , and a priestess . she ca nt crouch low in the undergrowth like younger folk can , and her white hair and the ropes of polished shell she wears stand out against the dark forest . she ventures closer than the others , raising a hand hesitantly in what is clearly a ritual gesture . the others encourage her subtly , and push forward two of our younger children as well . they do their duty as gobetweens , approaching the gods , their parents , but it is clear they are terrified . they are our children , and they are terrified of us . they are mortal , and they will die , as they all have since our first , what must be several hundred years ago now . for the twentieth time , i look at my child and know that i will never see her again . diana , agathway , will die this winter of old age . she knows this too , yet still , she is more afraid of us than she is of this knowledge . she drops her trembling hand and backs away . a murmur and a sigh goes up from the leaves . my heart breaks . newline newline and all of history is still to come .carl was sitting on the kitchen floor , staring blankly at the wall . he had the phone in his hand but was mentally at war . aurora had answers for everything , it was the planet s encyclopedia . carl just was nt sure if this was something he wanted the answer to . he let out a deep sigh and dialed the number . newline newline  good afternoon carl , this is elizabeth on behalf of aurora . how can we be of assistance ?  newline newline  elizabeth , i need to know if my daughter is actually mine .  newline newline  ... ok carl , please give me a minute ...  newline newline elizabeth kneaded her forehead as information about carl and his family populated the screen in front of her . she hated such requests . her childhood had been spent in an orphanage and she truly felt for anyone potentially having to go through the same . newline newline  carl , may i request further information ? what exactly will you do with the information ?  newline newline  uh yeah , yeah , sure ... my wife was recently in an accident . she s in a coma now and she s pregnant and expecting any day now . i do nt know what to do . we d been growing distant for a long time before that and i believe she may have cheated on me .  newline newline  well , you know that aurora offers no advice , only facts ? you will have to decide on your own how to proceed .  newline newline  yes , yes i understand . i just do nt know if i can raise someone else s child . it s terrible to say , but i just do nt know if i can . i just want to know the truth before i do anything .  newline newline elizabeth clutched her hands together tightly . she was trying her absolute best to keep her emotions under control but she wanted to scream at this man . how dare he consider abandoning this child ? newline newline she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes . newline newline  you re the father carl .  newline look , i never said we were in a relationship ,  jessica said , tensely . she struggled to keep her voice even , but anger crept in .  i did nt lead you on ! in fact , i was quite clear all along that this was just sex ! i m sorry that you got your feelings hurt !  newline newline across the table , rita struggled not to cry . she blinked hard several times . her eyes were still raw from crying all morning . as she thought back on the text message she received earlier that day , she could no longer hold back the stinging tears . newline newline  i do nt know what you expected ,  jessica sighed in annoyance . she deliberately twirled the diamond ring on the fourth finger of her left hand .  did you think we were going to get married one day and adopt a bunch of thirdworld babies ?  her voice rose as she spat out each word . newline newline  how could you get back together with chad ? he cheated on you with your best friend !  rita protested . newline newline  well , he finally came to his senses and realized what a whore she was and dumped her ,  jessica sneered .  besides , he s a kettering and i m a travers . it s going to be the wedding of the decade ! society monthly has already called us the hottest power couple in the tristate area ! they re doing a feature article on us in the january issue !  newline newline  you re just doing this because it s want your parents want !  rita argued .  we have something real and amazing ! i know you feel it too ! are you seriously going to throw that all away because you re afraid ?  newline newline  i know you re afraid ,  rita continued in a softer tone .  i get it . i ve been there . i understand how scary it can be to realize you re gay .  newline newline  i m not a fucking dyke !  jessica screeched .  what you and i did meant nothing ! i m going to marry chad kettering ! he and i are going to have a wonderful life together ! he s running for city councilman ! after that , it s the governor s mansion and then the white house ! i m going to be the first lady ! nobody is going to ruin that for me ! certainly not you !  newline newline jessica leaned across the table and hissed ,  stay away from me ! i do nt ever want to see you or hear from you again ! if you try to contact me , i will file a restraining order !  newline newline she stormed out of rita s apartment and drove off . newline newline  who the hell does she think she is ?  jessica fumed in her car .  how dare she talk to me like that ! she thinks she knows everything ! she thinks she understands what my life is like ! she does nt know shit !  newline newline a knot started to form in jessica s throat , as rita s voice replayed in her head   we have something real and amazing ! i know you feel it too !  newline newline  maybe i did ,  jessica muttered to herself , bitterly .  maybe i still do . but it does nt matter now .  newline newline jessica wiped away the tears that were beginning to form . she parked in front of chad s building and touched up her makeup . newline newline  that s in the past . this is the future i choose ,  jessica said to herself . she opened the car door and put on a big smile for chad .have you ever felt alone in a crowd ? ever been in a mall or on a bus , just minding your own business , when you re suddenly , inescapably struck with a feeling of isolation ? the people around you stop being people  they re not like you . how could they be ? how could they feel anything like the way you do , be anything like the way you are ? they do nt know what s happening in your mind , and how could they ? it s in these moments that you stop , just for a moment , and realize just how alone you really are . human beings , minds separated by just a few feet of meat , bone and air , and yet they might as well be on opposite sides of the earth . newline newline have you ever felt that way ? newline newline if you have , i imagine it passed as quickly as it came on . you pause , look around , seize upon some detail about one of the apes around you . the girl on the train staring out the window at the black , rushing walls of the tunnel  what does she see ? the child sitting , obstinate , on the stairs of library , mother or father cajoling , trying to get on with whatever minutia it is that they call their lives . you see these things , and it jars you  you can recognize what s happening before your eyes , relate to it , wonder about these people surrounding you  and they are people , once again , not just apes  and you realize that yes , you are one of them . newline newline you do these things . newline newline i do nt . newline newline i look around and i can only see apes . i can only see their faces , their bodies , their meat . there s no humanity there , no kindness , no communion . i go to movies , alone , and i sit in the dark . i watch the characters on the screen , and i watch the other theatregoers . they stare at the pictures , intent . a monster leaps out , frightens the protagonists  the movie watchers startle , clutch at one another and then , remembering that it s all a farce , glance at each other and smile , reassured . the characters fall in love , pledge themselves to one another , and the watchers smile , clasp their neighbours  hands . the movie ends and the lights come on  they file out together , laughing , into the sunlight . newline newline i ve seen a lot of movies . i ve never had a neighbour . newline newline if i try , if i really try , i can look like one of them , act like one of them . i do it some days , commit myself to a persona drawn , more or less , from a hat . who am i today ? am i the funny man , with his jokes and easy smile ? or will i be the asshole today , who swears at the slightest provocation , who scowls at everyone who dares to meet his eyes ? perhaps i ll be the lover , visiting the florist for a bouquet of red roses  that one is a challenge  the shopkeeper knows all about my beloved , and to keep the charade i must hold two people in my head at once : myself , and the man i profess to adore . newline newline there is no man , of course . no woman , either , for that matter . i m not funny , not angry , not in love . i just am  all of these things , and none , all at once . newline newline and i am alone .witch

stacy tucker . newline newline freddiedavestacy arrives home . home is an instantly peculiar , isolating place . it is a walkin scrapbook more than a bachelor s domicile . many homes are furnished with photographs of loved ones , family and friends . walk an inch in this grim flat and you ll trod on a photo album . i guarantee it . yet every photograph is just a different image of the occupant . heshe is the nucleous of attention . the memorandums are trinkets from past lives : the vivacious long distance runner volunteering in an aid centre somewhere in bolivia . a homeless man with bleary

newline newline  i am pathetic  he says . newline newline it s not an attack on monty mann , the fabulously named travelling vagrant who provided inspiration for this get up . it s an attack on the

moments later , a tall , sunburnt , sinewy man entered his own with a straw hat on his balding head . his brown eyes scanned the room , to ensure nothing was out of place , then they finally rested on his son . he looked up from his empty bowl and smiled . newline newline  morning , father . how were the crops ?  newline newline without an answer , he strode across the room , down an uneven hallway , and into his room . silence returned , then johnathan could hear the water running . peeking his head down the corridor , he could see his father s scythe propped against the wall , and felt the faint cool breeze of the cold water flow out underneath his door . newline newline this was not unusual for the boy , for his father could not speak and his fist was iron . in his bedroom was the only shower , that only he could use . in the boy s room only a sheet of steel with handfuls of hay laid out filled in its small moldy wooden walls . newline newline day in and day out his father would cut the wheat fields from dawn to dusk , and each day johnathan would sit at the table , either eating what he could find among the dust filled drawers and cabinets or idly sitting , forcing back the hunger that seemed to gnaw at his bones . newline newline there were beatings , oh yes . when the boy asked questions , or begged for food , or pleaded to be taught to farm , so he could earn a wage to provide for the family , his father was ruthless . he would beat him with a whip , the child had scars to prove it , and if the crime was too heinous , like taking the lord s name in vein , johnathan was forced to live outside in the blaring sun , without a trace of shade , for days on end . newline newline time went on , the boy grew into a tall , gangly looking teenager , with straw colored hair . his muscles grew , despite his lack of movement , and he was coming to the point of being able to overcome his father . but all was the same . it appeared to him even time did nt affect his father . he continued to farm the wheat with the scythe that never seemed to rust , and continued his beatings and punishments when he believed they were fit . the once boy still barely ate , and had nt been cleaned in many years . newline newline but one evening , as his father stood over him , gripping in his wrinkly calloused hands the handle of the whip , johnathan had enough . he sprung from where he cowered and sprinted down the hallway , snatched the scythe from its position and faced his father . newline newline sweat beaded his large forehead , and the sides of hair stuck to his skin . they eyed each other for some time , but when the child s father ran at him , whip held high , johnathan closed his eyes tight and swung the the blade . all he heard was it piercing the wall , and the thunk of something falling onto the floor . slowly opening his eyes , then them widening on their own , he released the scythe , ran over to heap of flesh and bone that was once his father , and wept . newline newline years went by , and in that time , johnathan grew to become a strong and sturdy man . his father was buried in the wheat field near the shanty house , and johnathan always paid his respects when he farmed . through the wages earned from selling the wheat , he afforded himself food for each day , and showers every three days . newline newline this continued on for decades , until he was an old man , unable to farm . newline newline he sat up in his father s bed , his chest heaved with every breath and his sunken glossy eyes glanced across the room for no particular reason . his liver spotted bald head was covered in a cold sweat , and his limbs felt like they were filled with cement . on the wall next to him , leaned the scythe . it was an heirloom now , despite it not having a predecessor following his death . childless , wifeless , penniless he was to die . newline newline johnathan closed his eyes , and an image swirled into vision against the black backdrop of his eyelids . it was a tall pale man , adorned in a black hood and cloak , much blacker than the background . he lifted his arm out towards johnathan , his ghostly hand slithered out from the sleeve . it was as if he merely wanted to shake hands . newline newline the man s light blue eyes twinkled under no light and his porcelain skin seemed to have a glow . was this death ? johnathan asked himself . is it my time to go ? the tall pale man shook his head . without moving his mouth , he spoke . newline newline  like the wheat field , use your scythe to farm those souls passing on . take my hand , and the line will continue . do not take my hand , and you will pass onto the afterlife , like your father before you .  newline newline fear crept up into the back of his mind , and sweat covered his frail body . to become death ? he asked . does it hurt ? does the pain leave ? newline newline  yes , you will feel younger than you have in many years . there is no pain , nor pleasure , once you accept the offer .  newline newline johnathan was nt educated , born and bred of ignorance , but he knew the offer , despite his mind telling him it was nt real , was too good to ignore . he was old , he was dying , there was nothing left to do but to accept . with one wrinkly hand , he reached forward in his mind and grasped the cold hand of death . newline newline and so it was done . life swirled and twisted up into his saggy fleshy limbs , embedded into his heart and brain , and lifted him up from his deathbed . he snatched the scythe from its position like he did before , and moved from his father s bedroom , down the hallway , and out into the wheat field . the sky was ablaze with yellows and oranges , and the ball of fire on the horizon gave the field s a golden hue . newline newline he stood at his father s grave , his eyes never wavering from the irregular lump of soil in the ground . as the sun moved down below and the moon made its way up , his flesh began to fall from bone , his eyes evaporated into nothing , and his straw colored hair left with the cool breeze . newline newlinejenna peeked her head out to get a look at the audience . every seat was full . people were standing in the back of the hall . they were all there to listen to her . sure , she saved the world , but it did nt make her any less nervous . newline newline after retreating to her seat backstage , she closed her eyes and took a deep breath . newline newline  i can do this ,  she told herself , drowning out the chatter of the crowd behind the curtains . she pictured herself back at the mountaintop , looking over the view with her father and it was almost like she was there . everything would be ok . the worst thing jenna shot open her eyes and jumped up . her heart was racing , but all she could think to do was breathe faster , making it worse . in the corner of her eye , she noticed the red glow of an exit sign . before she knew it , she was outside in a dark alley , the door slamming shut behind her . newline newline the cold air immediately made jenna feel better . the fact that she just bailed on her speech did nt hurt either . was she bailing though ? it was nt her intent , she just wanted to get away . everyone inside wanted to hear her , though . newline newline this was silly . jenna was the best agent in the mid agency . they recruited her because she beat up a man twice her size when she was a teenager . with their training , she had practically become a superhero . but , put her on a stage to talk about her achievements to the rest of the agency and she breaks down . what the hell ?  newline newline jenna heard something . it was like a crackle or some kind of static . she scanned the dreary alley , quickly finding a shadow that did nt quite belong . there was someone hiding behind the dumpster against the next building . without a moment s hesitation , she ran full force toward it . a man in a black jumpsuit leapt out , but before he could pull his rifle on her , she rammed him into the concrete wall . newline newline taking the man s previous spot behind the dumpster , she picked up the fallen rifle and performed another quick scan , revealing five more enemy locations . as they revealed themselves , jenna squeezed the trigger in short bursts as she swept her arms across as many of the areas as she could . four men fell to the ground as the sound of the shots reverberated throughout the alley . newline newline the last jumpsuit man stood in place , unable to move .  i told them we needed more ,  he said , his voice shaking . he dropped his gun as jenna stomped her way toward him .  please , do nt kill me !  he yelled , cowering in place . newline newline jenna kicked the man s feet , stumbling him to his knees .  you re not even going to try and fight me ?  she asked . newline newline  no maam ,  he answered .  you d win .  newline newline jenna gave him a smirk .  how do you know unless you try ?  she let out a chuckle and bashed him in the head with the butt of the rifle .  and i m no maam , jerk .  newline newline a team of security guard raced to the scene , securing the area . newline newline  are you ok , ms . malone ?  one of them asked . newline newline  yes , thank you ,  she answered .  i ll be fine as soon as i give this speech . he pulled out a large bottle of brandy , and a glass , and poured a glass . the scene kept replaying in his head . newline newline the ambulance flying down main , the rush to load her into the ambulance .  newline newline he downed the glass in a few gulps and set it down with nary a cough . he poured another glass , and the scene moved on , despite the alcohol . newline newline she was gasping for breath , crying for her daughter that was pronounced dead at the scene , my heart was already breaking while trying to stabilize her . stop the bleeding . something !  newline newline he drank down the second glass . he swayed a bit in his seat , and poured himself another glass . newline newline she let out one last shuddering gasp , and flatlined . cpr was ineffective ... i stared at her for a moment that seemed to last an eternity . then i called it .  newline newline he downed the third glass and tried for a fourth , but dropped the bottle , and accidentally hit his head trying to catch it . he barely felt it . it spilled into the carpet , and he just stared at it . a moment later he rubbed his forehead , and started weeping . he rose to his feet , swaying a great deal , and bracing himself against the wall , moved towards his bedroom , and collapsed , face first into his bed , where he cried himself to sleep . newline newline   you could nt save me ,  she said , in his nightmare .  newline newline   i know , i m sorry ,  i wept .  newline newline   no , you do nt understand . you could nt save me .   newline newline my bleak depression gave way to confusion .  what ?   newline newline   my daughter is waiting for me . you could nt save me .   newline newline   oh ,  i replied , suddenly understanding , the revelation pushing away the black cloud despair . hilary flint recoiled in disgust , wind cracked lips snarling . newline newline  you fucking morons ... this is a soul stone .  newline newline faith s eyes went wide with alarm . the search for true immortality had long been the quest of many an alchemist or mage , the ability to trump death even beyond a fae s lengthy lifespans a treasure beyond price . humans had a similar vision in their philosopher s stone , but unlike the maddened dreams of the young race , the fae actually succeeded in theirs . newline newline  who does it belong to ?  she asked tenatively . flint spat , as if he d tasted something bitter . newline newline  no one good , that s for certain . all i felt was oblivion , a great empty nothingness that seemed to strangle all thoughts of hope . something was in there . dark , and terrible . i d say we should destroy it but i d fear the consequences .  newline newline  we should take it to my grandfather ,  faith suggested .  he d know what to do .  newline newline  and what , bring it into the nest of vipers you call a court ? your grandfather might be a good fae , but your cousins and uncles , they d leap for a chance at an artifact of this power . we should sail into the middle of lake michigan and toss it over the side where it ll be lost for good .  newline newline slowly , as if weighing his words , faith nodded .  you re right . no one who s ever been sealed into a soul stone has ever been the type you would wish to be released . i ll see to the preparations and the task of finding a boat . please , flint , keep it safe .  newline newline with that she left the room , leaving the veteran ranger alone to his thoughts . he forgot to mention that the stone had spoke to him , its voice dripping with venom and cold , cruel hatred . newline newline come and see ... i made sure to apply my makeup extra carefully before putting on my suit . today was going to be a good day . today was going to be a good day . newline newline all right , you can do it ! go out there and put on a show ! newline newline   newline newline as i wandered around the park , i made sure to smile at all the little kids and wink at their parents . i even bought things for them , like ice cream and balloons . i liked it when they trusted me . newline newline   newline newline this was it : the big show ! my big chance ! i looked into the crowd and settled on a small boy in the third row . silently , although i pretended to giggle  it makes them feel more comfortable  , i pointed at him . his parents were a little hard to convince but i got him up on the stage . newline newline  hi there , would you like to see what we have behind the curtain ?  newline newline   newline newline ok , this is nt going too well . this kid wo nt stop crying . i tried everything : smiling , laughing , playing with him , giving him candies ... newline newline i know what will work . i ll put him in the fun house  for a while . newline newline   newline newline oh boy ! he just discovered the fake door . newline newline   newline newline oops , i do nt think he s very smart . he s been staring at his reflection in the evil mirror  for about twenty minutes . newline newline   newline newline his parents are back but he s still in the fun house  ! i ll distract them by making silly noises and hiding . hopefully they like this more than he did . newline newline   newline newline another long day at the amusement park is finished . i sure hope the kids had fun !i looked out beyond my large bedroom window and saw the blues and greens and oranges on earths surface and i wondered what it was like to swim in an ocean or hike through a desert or lay in a field of soft short grass . after several moments i turned away and went back to work desk and looked over my research papers . i was on an 18 month contract working for terratiw doing research on the discovered minerals of mars used for green energy back on earth . i was nt disillusioned about my work but my heart was not in in nearly as much as it was when i began . my mind often drifted to thoughts of earth and what it must be like to live there and to be truly free to roam and do you please . to walk a street or a trail in just plain clothes and no space suit . to eat fresh foods and drink non recycled water . to taste and smell and be with earth s oxygen . i liked many of the people here . we were sent to serve a purpose and we have done our best to find ways to maximize colonization for humans on planets in our solar system and beyond . i do not believe i am the only one who misses a home we have never been to but none of us truly show our feelings about it more than is acceptable without putting our mission in danger through low moral and mutiny . hundreds of us lonely in space trying to create a new home for our people . but i miss home . newline newline i was standing on my deck and looking into the night sky and i took in all the stars and constellations and satellites and saw the faint signalling of mars . i stepped up to my telescope to get a closer look and there i saw it in all it s glory . the future of mankind was on that red planet and i was never going to see it . i had been contracted by terratiw for 18 months to help with the testing on gravity stabilizers in zero and low gravity environments to be used on mars and space in the future . i wo nt pretend to understand it , i just write the coding for the software which runs the tests . i understand what i m doing has it s ultimate purpose . it s already too late to save earth but we are looking for ways to stabilize the atmosphere in order to give us enough time to develop the technology and ships to mass transport the people here to mars and beyond . i feel honored to do this job but it is not where my heart lies . i belong in the stars . i often fantasize and dream of what it would be like to take a proverbial moon walk , to jump from rock to rock in low gravity . to see earth with my own eyes a million miles away . to be a pioneer for the human species . conquistador of planets and space rocks in the name of peace and prosperity . i took my eyes away from the night sky and studied the forest that was at the back of my property . nobody , nothing there . i went back inside to look at my work . newline newline i stare at you , longing to be with you , and i know this will never happen . i will perform duty to humanity so that future generations may experience what i only may dream of .the truck hit fast , and then i was here . newline newline i knew what had happened straight away . in the end i consider it a relief . newline all around me was white , endless , infinite and without detail or texture . newline for so long ... so so long , there was nothing . i was sure it was hell , it is hell . newline i was relieved however that hell was nt the fire and brimstone and never ending torture i d assumed it would be . newline eventually , however , details emerged from the nothingness . a wisp of blue , a few weeks later a strand of shining gold . newline this continued for years . more and more detailed it became before it started to take on a recognisable shape . newline after growing and changing and taking form and figure , shifting from vague floating colours to the shape of a person and after eons of waiting she finally spoke . newline newline she came to life in an instant . her eyes fluttered and revealed their deep electric blue shade . i had so long to inspect every detail but she was just a shape for so long . a thing . inanimate and perfectly still . but now she moved and colour filled her skin , tiny freckles dotted themselves along her arms and her golden hair glowed with humble brilliance . newline newline  who are you ?  i demanded . a flutter of guilt weighed in my stomach as i grimaced at a ruined first impression . newline  i am that which was lost .  she said as she exhaled deeply . newline her voice was melodious and sweet . newline  lost ? how ? when ?  idiot  i thought to myself . newline  life was harsh to you sam . but it need not have been . i am not truly who i appear , but an aspect of her , the her that could of helped you .  newline angry bile filled my throat  i died ! and i was left here to go mad by myself ! i ve had a hundred life times to think about what i was , what i did . what happened to me . he used to hit me . my father . my mother left and i remained with him . cruel and harsh he was . drunken and neglectful .  newline by now tears had welled in my eyes , the beautiful woman nodded peacefully . newline  what do you want to hear ?  i said as i buried my face into my hands newline  wan na hear how i played the victim ? how i was lazy ? how i procrastinated my assignments and then used my hardships as an excuse ? pathetic ! pathetic ! paatheticc ! ! !  newline stupid stupid stupid i hate myself i hate myself i wasted it and now here i am  my mind was swimming with volatile thoughts that bubbled crazily through my brain . newline and then her arms were around me , my head pressed shoulder , the sound of her heart , the warmth of her body . it was bliss . newline  shhh.. shh.. my love , do not hate yourself . do not hate . i would of loved you .  her voice took on crackled emotion , there was sincerity .  this is hell . for all of us . i was you re soulmate and you were mine . this is what we are condemned to . to know things could of been better . to linger on the knowledge that there was someone who could fix everything . and then to exist here until time stops . chances missed , mistakes made , regrets that will forever bourdon you . that is what hell shall be for us .  newline newline and she was gone . everything was gone . newline newline   edit  shit . i read the prompt as  the person you could of been with .   how did i think this would be a good idea . these people were not ready for the ideas . i should have known . i should have listened more closely to my history lessons . i thought they would be grateful . i thought they would understand . they did nt understand , they were nt grateful . they were afraid . newline newline it started slow . i had to establish myself which was nt hard with my knowledge . they respected me for my intellect . some even revered me as they noticed that i seemed to know things that were going to happen before they happened but then after a few years i began to tell others my knowledge and try to introduce the technology . newline newline they thought i was crazy . they could nt wrap their minds around it . as a species we created this technology slowly , made it in baby steps , having our understanding grow alongside the tech . it seems like these people could nt handle it all at once , and did nt want to . newline newline i m on the run for religious heresy now . i never should have come back here . i never should have told them as much as i did . the accusations were too much . the messages were being received well until it got to the church . the priests denounced me and now everywhere i go they shun me , if they do nt try to kill me . newline newline i do nt want to be here anymore . i want to go home . if you find this letter please , do nt let anyone make the same mistake i made .  newline newline edit : punctuation errorthis gets really good but i think the opening is pretty weak , i was losing interest until they went into cryo . newline it could do with some more careful proofreading too , there are quite a few mistakes in the grammar and a lot of things that are nt consistent with being in zero gravity . for example  pouring water into a cup , sliding along a floor , tears streaming down faces and lots of other little slips . newline newline i do think you do an excellent job of portraying the change in gerald s mental state , there s the core of a great story here but it could use more polish .the wicked glint in her eye sent shivers down aiden s spine . it s a look that has always been reserved for him . newline newline those penetrating green eyes swallowed him up , and his mind raced back in time for a moment , to the many warm summer nights of their youth . they and a bunch of the neighbor kids always played games until it was too dark to see and their parents called them in . newline newline  freeze !  ilsa shouted gleefully , hopping around the tree and jabbing aiden in the ribs . he giggled and tried to pull away . newline newline ilsa leaned close to aiden , her gaze narrowing sharply .  when i touch you , you freeze !  newline newline normally aiden would give in  ilsa was the best at freeze tag  . tonight , though , the green starburst pattern in her eyes shimmered in the fading evening light , and aiden realized he was staring at them . he blushed , and turned his face . newline newline she pouted .  you re not playing fair !  newline newline aiden s eyes widened . she smelled like strawberries and pine needles . her long blonde hair was tangled from running around , but she looked radiant . he noticed the curve of her body as she leaned in , and he froze . newline newline a smile tugged at her rosy lips , and she said triumphantly ,  good !  before storming away . newline newline aiden leaned against the tree to catch his breath , although he had nt been running . newline newline  newline newline 10 years later , aiden found himself again out of breath as ilsa leaned toward him with that wicked glint in her eye . newline newline  do nt move ,  she whispered , crouched at the foot of the bed . newline newline as if i could , he thought to himself , tugging at the tightly bound silk ties at his wrists and ankles . newline newline ilsa was grabbing something from behind her , continuing to smile wickedly . aiden s heart raced . he never got tired of this . newline newline she slowly crawled across the bed toward him , an ice cube dripping in her hand . she seductively licked it off once , and ran it over her bare chest . aiden s breath caught in his throat . newline newline ilsa leaned over him , tracing the edges of his mouth with the ice cube . her voice , soft in his ear , murmured :  when i touch you ... you freeze . puella s bodyguards were eager to get her out of the open and inside . walking a little too quickly to be calm , the muscled men on either side of puella guided her from the skyscraper lobby to the 29th floor . their heads kept on a swivel the whole way , black glasses hiding their gaze . twisting and turning through a veritable maze of grey corridors , the trio arrived at their destination after an agonizing minute . they entered a conference room , a single glass desk accompanied by two sturdy black chairs . the room had no windows , and no vents . newline newline  thank you !  puella enthusiastically said .  i want to be alone before the meeting for now .  newline newline  ms , our orders are to never let you out of our sight . like it or not , we are here for your protection .  newline newline the bodyguards , expertly trained , boasting years of experience , knew only that she was the public head of cerberus . any details about puella were unknown to even the most devoted information brokers . newline newline puella let out a short laugh .  my protection ? you re here for mine !  the men went pale .  its okay . a lot of people make that mistake ,  puella followed , speaking with her usual childlike bluntness . the guards had gone against the wishes of puella . the face of cerberus . no one went against cerberus . newline newline  of course , miss ,  the men said curtly . they left , leaving puella alone to wait for her planned meeting . inevitably , company arrived . like malignant silk he slipped through the partially opened door . glancing left and right , the suited man seemed surprised to see only puella , seated comfortably in one of the chairs .  it s surprising that the most important person in the world has so little security ,  said the assassin to puella . newline newline  i am here , there is no better security ,  was the casual reply . newline newline  i ll keep this brief then .  the assassin drew his assault shotgun , silencer mounted around the fattened barrel . pumping three shots of rounds into puella , the man adopted a fierce grimace . sitting calmly , puella let the dozens of pellets sink into her body . every round hit its target . the surrounding room was in perfect condition . so was puella . newline newline  oh . you re one of those people ,  puella said , dissapointed . newline newline  tsk .  newline newline                               newline newline the chairman dismissed his aides and walked through the conference room door . he immediately focused on the splat of blood on the glass table .  puella ! what happened ?  newline newline  its fine ! i took care of it ,  puella said . newline newline  it ?  newline newline  yeah . it .  newline newline  i ll take your word for it .  the chairman glanced around .  you sure you do nt need security in here ?  newline newline  should cerberus want for anything ,  she asked ?a strangely somber feeling enveloped the room as the sounds of ticking that seemed to permeate the very walls of the structure simply stopped . its work was done . it had discovered the end , something that had been deemed impossible , but by this point there wasn  t a single soul about to see it . the dust that had settled across every surface shifted in the darkness as every disturbance in the air ceased and stillness took over . time stretching across what felt like aeons , the small screen sat blinking but redundant . the world outside continued to turn . newline newline stepping into the room long after all noise had ceased and the layers of dust had only thickened the thing that struck the man was the stillness . the significance of his discovery seemed to hang in the air even as he stepped further into the room , completely unaware of the purpose of the machine he found before him . the plastic was old and weathered despite being protected , cracking with age , yet the screen remained clear . newline newline  solution discovered.  newline newline sitting in the chair before the machine , ignorant of the large cloud of dust it exhaled , he stared and contemplated what he should do . it was clear that somebody had taken the time to ensure that this machine would live on no matter what , but it was also clear that said person was long gone as his fingers fell across the unfamiliar keys . newline newline  delete ?  we sacrificed mankind  s legacy for the legacy of men.  newline newline  what do you mean ? i don  t understand ,  the boy said . newline newline his father picked up the young child and hoisted him onto his shoulders . the two of them had a long walk to get to the outpost and he knew the boy hadn  t had a proper meal in days . now was the time to conserve his strength . the sun was bearing down and heat was rising off the ground in the distance . he gave his son a sip of his water from his backpack and took some for himself . newline newline  think about it . everybody wants to live forever . we know that  s not possible , so we try to do the next best thing . we try and accumulate a lot of money and power so that we will be remembered even after we are gone . though we all eventually die , our legacy continues.  newline newline the boy  s head bobbed with each step his father took down the dust covered road . abandoned vehicles decorated the sides  most of them showing evidence of breakin and salvage . newline newline his father continued ,  who was the first president of the united states ?  newline newline  george washington ,  spoke the boy . he remembered that name from his father  s teachings . newline newline  and who invented the cotton gin ?  newline newline the boy scratched his head underneath his yankees cap in though . newline newline  ummm.eli whitney !  he proudly announced . newline newline  good ! well , think about this . if the whole world was gone , who would remember those people ? without any humans left , does it matter who the first president was or who invented the cotton gin ?  newline newline  no , i guess not ,  he said with a frown on his face . maybe what he had learned from his lessons wasn  t so important , afterall . newline newline his father noted the tone of concern in his son  s voice . it was a difficult lesson to learn , but he knew very well that the boy would need to learn why things were the way they were now . newline newline  well , the point is  we are now paying for the negligence of the generations before us . instead of using our resources to either save our own planet or find another one to live on , they wasted them on becoming popular and building their own wealth.  newline newline the child was silent . they continued to march along the path . in the distance was the outpostand smoke was rising up to the sky from one of the buildings . newline newline  dadwhat does negligence mean ?  newline newline  oh , sorryit means that you have a duty to do something and then you don  t.  newline newline  so , dad , you mean your dad  s generation had a duty to stop all this ? i mean , the weather shifts and all ?  newline newline he took a minute to think before giving an answer . it was easy in retrospect to place the blame on the millennials . they were an easy target , especially now that they were all gone . sure , they knew the data . they had seen the trends of the oceans and the melting ice caps . but solving that problem involved sacrificing personal wealth , and as a result they continued their ways . newline newline  yes , they had a duty . but now they  re all gone and there  s only a few of us left to try and survive as long as we can . we also had a chance to maybe leave this planet and start fresh on a new one , but nobody wanted to use resources to make that happen.  newline newline the outpost was only a few hundred meters ahead . a few abandoned fields surrounded the area  mostly barren with the exception of a few weeds that could survive the daily temperature shifts . newline newline  do you think we  ll find food ?  the boy asked . it was starting to get cold and the child was beginning to shiver . he pulled his hood over his yankees cap . newline newline  i  m not sure , but we might have to put off looking until morning . the cold winds are coming in and we don  t want to be trapped outside when they come . let  s hurry.  newline newline he pulled his son down from his shoulders and took the child  s coat out of his bag . he bundled him up and put his gloves over his small hands . he hadn  t had room to bring his own jacket or gloves , so time was of the essence . newline newline  dad , can we run ?  said the child . he looked frightened , and rightfully so . newline newline they quickened their walk to a jog . now was the time to get inside  just a hundred meters or so to go . newline newline they came upon the outpost . three buildings  ravaged by obvious conflict . newline newline smoke continued to pour out the windows of one building , which made for a poor shelter choice . the second building had already been caught ablaze weeks previous and looked to be structurally unsound . newline newline  let  s go in here ,  the father said as he motioned to the third building . it had boarded windows and appeared structurally safe . newline newline  how do we know if it  s safe ? if there  s anyone else in there ?  the child asked . newline newline it was a legitimate question . while the population was thinning by the day , running into others was mostly an unwelcome experience . looting was common , and people had been known to murder for even small amounts of food . but , shelter from the frost winds took priority . newline newline  let  s just go . we don  t have a choice ,  he said as he felt for his pistol on his waist . the light was giving way to dark . newline newline he opened the door and stepped inside . the building was dark and the he motioned for his son to remain as quiet as possible . they tiptoed through the room and found an open closet . it was empty . they stepped inside , closed the door , and listened . the building was silent . they took off their gear and sat down on the dirty floor . the child laid his head on his father  s shoulder . newline the house began to shake as the frost winds picked up . stepping outside at this point would be suicide . even from the closet , the roar of the winds was near deafening . they hoped the building would stand through it all . newline newline  alright son , let  s try and get some sleep . we have a busy day and we  ll need to check all three buildings for food . i know you  re hungryi am too . we  ll just do our best and hopefully there  s something left here . we  ll have to keep an eye out for other looters , too.  newline newline  do you think we  ll see anyone else ?  newline newline  i  m not sure , son . i sure hope not.  newline newline the child took off his cap and closed his eyes . sleep with such strong hunger pangs and the sound of the winds wouldn  t be easy  but he was exhausted . as he tried to lull himself to sleep he imagined the can of carrots he had found two days previous and could taste the sweetness of each bite . tomorrow would be a good day , he told himself . his father wrapped his arm around him to keep him warm . it would certainly be a cold night , even indoors . newline newline  goodnight dad ,  said the child as he drifted to slumber . newline newline  goodnight . i love you ,  replied . he draped his son s coat over them both . there just has to be some food , he thought . there has to be . newline alright , i m sure you ve all heard about the recent developments in the middle east . anybody care to speak up ?  newline newline simultaneously , all the heads in the room turned towards the united states delegate . the tension instantly became palpable as the silence hung in the air as the us delegate looked around the room , eyebrow raised in confusion . newline newline then , it dawned on her . newline newline  oh yeah , sure . nuke all the turbans because we re fucking murica ! give your oil to the land of the triggerhappy , home of the obese or we ll shove 200 megatons of freedom down your face .  she responded , her voice dripping with sarcasm . newline newline  it was nt us , you utter twats . though our cia knows that japan s been up to more than nextgen consoles and dslr cameras .  she added , casting an accusatory glance at the opposite end of the room . newline newline bam ! newline newline the japanese delegate smashed his fit onto the desk and stood up with indignant rage . the indian delegate next to him rolled back a few feet on his chair , eyes wide in shock at the splintered pieces of wood on the floor . newline newline   ! ! you bombed hiroshima . you bombed nagasaki . and now you accuse us of committing your trademarked atrocity against other countries ! ? why do nt you tell everybody how you re itching to sue the culprit for taking your signature move whenever things get hard ?  newline newline  quuuuiiiieeeeeeeeeeet ! !  a highpitched voice shrieked . newline newline  good lord , 63 years of politics and things never change ,  the voice sighed .  i ve been in power before any of your had your balls drop or been visited by the breast fairy , so why not shut up and put your butts in your seats ?  newline newline the room settled down and turned their attention to the uk delegate . to their surprise , queen elizabeth herself showed up . newline newline  after everything i ve seen the past few decades , this has only cemented my resolve ,  she continued .  the united kingdom nuked the middle east .  newline newline the entire room had frozen . newline newline  why ?  asked the japanese delegate , the veins in his hand still taut with rage from us s accusation . newline newline  it s simple , my dear . the pope asked me to . frodo had never been on a ship this big before . he d certainly never been on the bulbous bridge of an elven capital ship , with towering synthglass panels on all sides curving up impossibly and meeting a hundred feet above his head . the view out the front of the bridge made his stomach pinch . there they were : the pillars of creation , close enough to fill his entire field of view , gold and fluffy and immeasurably , unbearably huge . newline newline  it is a gift !  shouted boromir , the headstrong eldest son of gondor s king .  a gift to the foes of mordor . why not use this ring ?  newline newline frodo eyed the ring . it sat , gleaming dully , atop the plinth in the center of the bridge where he d placed it a minute ago . releasing it from his possession had left him with the most queasy feeling , his bones transformed to rubber . newline newline  you can not wield it ,  said aragorn , sitting back , still wrapped in the star ranger s dark green coat that accompanied him everywhere .  none of us can . the ring answers to sauron alone .  newline newline frodo would have sworn that the ring shone brighter for a moment when aragorn pronounced its master s name . newline newline ah , space christ . this was no place for a hobbit . frodo s people were wayfarers , nomads . life in zero g had left them smaller and more compact than these towering landdwelling specimens . a hobbit s bones were short and stout , though not as thick or durable as a dwarf s . it was an excess of gravity that led to the stocky stature of the dwarves , who made their living excavating deep beneath the surface of dense metal planets . newline newline it was the dwarves , thought frodo , with whom he identified most closely . simple , proud people who made an honest living , without any of the hightech dalliances of the elves , or the unblinking arrogance of the purehumans . newline newline if you d told frodo two weeks ago that he would be here , right now , his mates sam and merry and pippin taking a tour of the engine room , and him standing on the bridge himself , surrounded by the galaxy s most important people  he would have told you to shove it up your exhaust pipe . their ship had barely made it from the shire in one piece , hounded as they were by the silent black frigates that gandalf said were piloted by sauron s top commanders . if not for the assistance of aragorn , who d guided them from jump point to jump point in his muted silver corsair anduril , and even fended off the black riders alone for a few minutes while frodo and the others dealt with an overheated hyperdrive , they would be nothing but molecules floating , miles apart , through the dead , empty vacuum . newline newline what brought frodo s attention back to the discussion at hand was the sudden movement of gimli , one of the dwarves , who lunged out of his seat , violet lightaxe crackling to life , and brought the sizzling blade down on the ring with all the force his burly arms could muster . newline newline there was a searing screech , and a crack , as the lightaxe scoured a deep rut into the plinth . the ring , struck full force , simply scooted a few inches to the side and arrested itself . newline newline  oh , great ,  said legolas , the snootiest elf frodo had ever met .  typical dwarf .  newline newline before gimli could respond , elrond rose to his feet , extending a hand that silenced everyone at once . newline newline  the ring can not be destroyed , gimli , son of gloin , by any craft that we here possess ,  said elrond , his voice assuming a supremely patronizing tone that frodo prayed was unintentional . newline newline  the ring ,  continued elrond ,  was made in the fires of the galaxy s core . only there can it be unmade . it must be taken deep into mordor and cast back into the supermassive black hole from whence it came .  newline newline acrid smoke rose up from the ruined plinth s black gash . the smell  like an overclocked supercomputer thinking itself to death  seemed out of place on the glittering bridge . newline newline  one of you ,  said elrond ,  must do this .  newline newline the words hung in the air , fat and unpleasant . newline newline  one does not simply fly into mordor ,  said boromir after a while .  its systems are guarded by more than just orcs . there is evil there that does not sleep , and the great eye is ever watchful . it s a barren wasteland , riddled with fire and ash and dust . not with a fleet of ten thousand carriers could you do this .  newline newline  did you hear nothing lord elrond said ?  shouted legolas , leaping to his feet , his long blond hair billowing .  the ring must be destroyed !  newline newline  and i suppose you think you re the one to do it ,  said gimli . newline newline in a flash they were all bickering , even gandalf , who frodo had never taken for the argumentative type . normally frodo would have enjoyed this  not every day did the highest and mightiest dwellers of the universe embarrass themselves in front of a humble hobbit  but for some reason he d developed a thrumming , redhot headache . after a while their shouts and sneers became too much for him to stand . newline newline  ah , fuck ,  he shouted ,  i ll take the damn thing .  newline newline everyone stopped  legolas even left his mouth hanging open midinsult  and stared at him . newline newline  the condition is that you all have to shut up , though ,  grumbled frodo .the only light came from the dim headlights , illuminating the painted yellow dashes speeding along . driving alone at night gave her a sense of peace . it always satisfied her longing of running away and leaving everything behind . all she had to do was go straight , pass her exit and keep going until she reached a place that didn  t remind her of her current life . she never did leave but she always let her mind and heart fly free until she slowed and turned the car into its familiar path back home . back home to the darkness and empty void that could never be filled with all of the harsh fluorescent lighting . to a bed that was never warmed and now only worn on one side . a home brimming with reminders of the life it once encompassed  while remaining almost untouched , it now reads barren and foreign . newline newline startled , her eyes wide , she tried to refocus on the road ahead of her . she had felt that all familiar push . no , she couldn  t have , it was impossible . but her back still twitched in reflex . she had felt that once annoying kick to the back of the seat that she now missed so much . she had felt the pressure against her spine forcing her forward . confident of driving straight once more , she turned her head to look at the seat behind her . dark and empty , as she knew it would be . but in the corner of her eye she saw her passenger . she twisted back in her seat , staring at her once empty passenger seat , now holding her beloved matthew . he was nt looking at her but he road , and she followed his gaze . her exit was approaching . newline newline tears lined her eyes at the realization of her return to that lonely house . matthew and lucas weren  t at her destination , nor were they in her car with her now . how could she feel their presence now ? now , when she dreams of escape she sees them , but not when surrounded by their physical memories . she stared straight down the road , refusing to look in the direction of what must be described as insanity . while stubborn she still tried to reassure herself they weren  t there ,  are you coming home this time ?  she laughed as silence answered her . of course he wasn  t there , neither of them were . she began to accept her irrationality as grief and not insanity . but then she felt his touch . ever so slight but firm , his fingers running across her cheek . a pause and then what could only be described as the warm embrace of skin and lightly parted lips . relenting , she woefully turned to her passenger seat , dark and vacant . newline newline her tears more robust fell into her lap . she wanted to run , escape this loneliness . she remains haunted by her loss . any sane person would flee a haunting , move on and start anew . she has returned to her home every night for the past eighteen months  each time expecting to find matthew and lucas there once more . that is the definition of insanity is it not . her mind fluttered with debate . she chose to remain insane , night after night . after all , feeling lucas kick her seat , seeing matthew and feeling his kiss , these things aren  t grief but a mind that has truly broken . she could try to mend it . just go straight . overwhelming depression waits at home , but she was clearly insane . how would running solve anything ? escaping was a chance , she could try again . just go straight . she would go straight , give herself a fighting chance . she felt sure this time , she would go straight . her exit upon her , she reached out her hand to grasp where matthew  s had been . she found it and gave it a squeeze . releasing her foot from the pedal she flipped on her indicator and started to merge . newline the dronebowl , brought to you by budlight !  the announcer exclaims . a banner flashes across the screen with a stadium of cheering fans in the background . i m busy in the locker room gearing up when my buddy smith turns to me with a nervous look on his face . newline newline  hey adam , i feel like i m gon na puke .  he says . newline newline  no reason to worry man , we ve been training hard for this .  i respond with a shaky voice . newline newline times have changed . war used to be fought in numbers . invasions of foreign lands and the destruction of resources was the norm . not anymore . militaries no longer exist . if a dispute between nations needs to be settled , they call in their most elite . much like the gladiators , death is a form of entertainment . while the rest of the nation sits in their homes and watches via drone footage , a select number of warriors is called upon to do the government s dirty work . i m one of those warriors . newline newline  listen man , we re gon na destroy them . the iranians have nt been to a dronebowl in 5 years . after it s all over , we can take our  25 million contracts and party in dubai .  i try to comfort smith , but the truth is , i feel like puking too . newline newline  one minute until the battle begins !  the announcer on the tv shouts . newline newline i lock and load my weapon and kiss a picture of my family goodbye . i often wonder if all this death is worth the power . the pain and suffering for a few to get rich . it s better than it used to be , but i guess there really is no perfect system . i m currently the leader in my squad of nine american soldiers . as an undefeated team , i have little worries . they stack up behind me at a giant metal gate . i hear someone puke , probably smith . newline newline  alright boys , let s give em hell !  i scream as the gate begins to open . newline newline we move out of the gate and into formation . the playing field resembles a city block . fans are guarded by bulletproof glass to avoid any injuries . drones circle above to give the viewers at home a perspective of the fight . when you hit the arena , it s not about the money , the power , or the fans . it s about the guys next to you and praying that they make it home . newline newline i sprint to the side of a building . i give a few hand signals to my guys to get into position . i shift my focus down the street and see a figure poking his head out . in one swift motion i pull my weapon up and squeeze the trigger . newline newline  there goes adam with the first kill of the match ! a headshot like that will award him his 485th kill !  i hear the announcer echo in the background . newline newline killing does nt bother me anymore . i ve done it enough times to stop caring . i signal my guys to move forward when suddenly automatic fire pierces the air . bullets scream past my head so i dart down an alleyway . i frantically look around , none of my team is in sight . a violent exchange of gunfire seems to go on for eternity . i hear screams in the distance . explosion after explosion hits near my position . i shift my eyes back towards the street to see scattered bodies parts . newline newline the announcer comes over the speaker again ,  smith for the americans has just been eliminated by an iranian rpg ! many others wounded !  newline newline i begin to panic . i pretend the announcement was just a hallucination . the enemy seems better trained than i thought . i should ve known to not underestimate them . another explosion , way too close this time . i get slammed to the ground and everything goes silent , only a ringing in my ears . i attempt to stand up but my body is numb . i see the twisted metallic remains of my weapon too far away to reach . my eyes scan the street again . a teammate , both legs missing , tries crawling towards me with a tormented look on his face . figures dressed in black appear behind him , executing him on the spot . i ca nt move , terror overwhelms my body . i regain my hearing just in time to hear the words i never thought i d hear . newline newline  adam appears to be the only surviving american soldier ! this does nt look good for his fans !  the announcer s voice seems to echo into infinity . newline newline the black figures see me and move in closer . they re speaking a language i ca nt understand , but they sound joyous . instead of ending me on the spot they drag me into the street . drones circle in close to capture my imminent demise . one man starts addressing the drones , giving some sort of a victory speech . another comes in closer wielding a large machete . this one speaks english , i m assuming he s their leader . newline newline  any last words ?  he states in a cocky manner . newline newline i say nothing , only smile . he seems confused , he has no idea what was coming his way . i finally get to use the weapon i never thought i would need . i manage to reach to my side and pull the charger on my suicide vest . before they knew what was happening , i obliterated the city block with a force that could be heard for miles . evaporating every last soldier on the playing field . newline newline the announcer comes over the speaker ,  what a turn of events ! hope you enjoyed the show ! join us next time for the dronebowl !  newline newline newlinetime to get to work . no amount of training can prepare a person for this kind of ordeal . newline newline you see , i d been trapped  tied up from head to toe , there was no escape for any reasonable observer . i was trapped here in this big city bank with all these 3rd rate actors . newline newline well , i guess they re not actors since they re real people , but that s how i ve thought of everyone except the antagonists ever since i realized how powerful i was . i can persuade anyone to do what i want , i can hit a target with a shotgun from 30 meters away , i can always land a car perfectly after jumping a ramp . it s almost as if my life is an action movie . newline newline this scene was no different than the 30 others i find myself in every day . bad guy does something bad . i do some badass jumps , kicks , flips , and karate . then bad guy runs away or gets arrested . it s almost more fun when they run though , cause then that means more action later for me  or i get to have a chase sequence . those are my favorite . newline newline  what s your name ?  newline newline i snap back into this awesome reality . newline newline  you , with the stunningly handsome face i m about to kick in , answer me !  my captor shouted . newline newline  hornripper , barry hornripper .  i answer confidently . newline newline  well , barry , today is your unlucky day .  he said as he aimed his bazooka at me . newline newline  if you say so buddy .  i quip , knowing how awesome i am . newline newline  you pissed off the wrong guy today , hombre .  newline newline he pulled the trigger on the bazooka , and nothing happened . just as i predicted . newline newline he tried pulling it again . nothing . newline newline finally he looked down the barrel . newline newline even i surprise myself at what i m capable of sometimes : i kicked off my shoe towards where i heard his voice . from what i saw in that moment , the shoelace caught on the trigger and pulled it once more . this time it went off . the rocket fired straight through the robber s head and blew up the ceiling above . i turned my body around perfectly timed to catch a piece of the golden chandelier that fell . i quickly used the jagged edge to cut my hands free , then my legs . newline newline at this point , the other three robbers finally realized what i d done and picked up their aks to fire at me . well , i ran directly at one . his gun jammed . i disposed of him promptly with a headbutt followed by a sweeping leg kick . i grabbed his gun and took cover behind the bank counter . newline newline i heard bullets dashing up against the plywood , and thought to myself how lucky it was that they made their counters out of a bulletproof material . newline newline i took a quick peek above cover to locate the other two bad guys . i saw one spraying bullets manically like a total psychopath . like really dude ? at least aim instead of going full rambo on everyone . newline newline i lifted my gun , fired off a single round , and downed him with a perfect shot through the heart . newline newline at this point , the other bad guy realized he was alone 1v1 versus a wicked awesome hero , who was nt afraid of any of his tactics . newline newline he ran . newline newline this made me happy . it was my first chase sequence all week . newline newline dashing out of the rubbleridden bank , i watched him drive off . a 30 second head start always made it more exciting . newline newline i walked up to the first car i saw  a 2017 bugatti chiron , the car i had been dreaming of driving since they tied me up . newline newline the keys were in the glove compartment , the second place i look after the sun visor . pretty typical . newline newline i started the engine and peeled out on a daring quest to catch that guy before he did real damage to the city . newline newline after hopping on the freeway , i spotted his beat up white van easily amongst the rest of the traffic . i pulled up next to him with a smile and a wave . he panicked and fired off a few shots at me . all of which missed by a mile . newline newline a few seconds later , i was too busy mocking this guy and his bad aim that i totally did nt see the huge trailer in front of me . fortunately , it was one of those trucks they haul cars with and my bugatti hit the up ramp just right so i drove to the top . newline newline thinking quickly , i jumped out and onto the van beside me . i landed it like some olympic gold medalist and then crawled to the front windshield so i could really make fun of this fool . newline newline i hung around for a little bit  all while he tried to shake me off  , and finally decided to crawl in . i punched him five or six times , but he stayed conscious somehow . i was getting a little bored with his schtick , so i turned the van towards the nearest gas station and rolled out . newline newline the van sped right into pump number 4 and everything exploded . newline newline i walked away casually . the day was saved , the city was safe , i was a hero once again . newline newline hopefully tomorrow helicopters are involved ... another one just popped , deploying the agent .  newline  again ? i do nt really trust that one .  newline  you re not supposed to trust  that one . it does nt matter anyway , he s already escaped and hurtling towards the target  . newline i had already escaped and was hurtling towards my target . my job in that time period was to prevent any chance of quantum looping from occurring . that means i prevent the unnecessary advancement of society . the target i was looking for was a scientist who had lost grant money for a time travel experiment . he had gone awol and finished the project , without any of the proper safety measures . the activation of the machine had resulted in a large explosion which replaced his lab with a small section of jungle that had been populated with dinosaurs . the target aimed to travel to the 1920s , where he would deposit a personal data assistant among the general population . his lack of safety in this procedure , however , resulted in his death upon entering the portal . when i began my mission i appeared somewhere under new york city . reports had suggested that he had landed somewhere in the mountains . a brief flight to a  meteor crash  had revealed nothing much . the target had disintegrated , along with his technology . all that remained was a smoking pile of rot with bits of melted metal pouring out of it . evidence of the metal was to much of a risk to let go . corpses can be a burden to travel through time , so i thought it best to do something simpler . i d let him travel on his own . the minute the portal opened i hurled his body through . doing that would create a worm effect . his body soon broke into a series of particles that would be scattered all across space and time . i radioed back to base to confirm target neutralization , but all i had heard was static . newline  figures ,  i muttered to myself ,  that incident was what caused the formation of the p.u.a.s . those idiots just prevented themselves from being born .    oct 17 2022 newline newline it is the tenth successful day of operation . we are stationed underneath a small coal power plant in venezuela , a few dozen miles outside caracas . the power plant is nonfunctioning , but acts as a smoke screen to our operations . we bring in a few shipments of coal every now and then to avoid suspicion , and we keep a steady stream of smoke coming from the cooling tower . newline newline dr. howsawitts  theories are working perfectly so far in practice , as evidenced by the growing number of painenergy factories  pef  that are starting to spread out all around the world . the power source is injected with a neurotoxin derived from dendrocnide moroides , which causes extreme pain but no permanent damage to the body . a surgicallyimplanted device then intercepts the neuron activity and redirects it , allowing us to harvest it as electricity . we can achieve a rough 85  efficiency in the redirection . newline newline we have ten sources so far , and we have another six on their way to us right now . with those six additional sources , we expect to be generating 7680 mwh per day . each source has a capacity of 40 mw , but we have a cycle in place that runs them in 12 hour shifts . 12 hours on and off was of course dr. howsawitts  prediction of an optimal system that would maximize power generation . newline newline    oct 29 2022 newline newline we had a source perish today . rather unfortunate , really , and quite messy . i ve instructed the guards to keep a closer watch to prevent this sort of thing from happening again . newline newline the doctor quit too . would nt say why , so we had no choice . we ll have to hire a new one . newline newline    nov 19 2022 newline newline there was a human rights lawyer snooping around today which had us all a little unnerved . however we were able to successfully avoid any suspicion regarding our operations . however , it got me thinking . i had never really seen things up close before , and so i put it on my todo list . newline newline    dec 09 2022 newline newline i had the strangest thing happen to me today . i had finally taken a trip to the plant to see it firsthand . i was walking around the inner wall , which acts as a soundproof oneway mirror . and one of the sources , the source , it was a lady . around 20 years of age . it looked at me , or possibly just over my shoulder , and started murmuring  help  over and over again . it should not have been possible , there was no way of knowing that i was standing there . perhaps just an illusion or some delusion . newline newline it shook me though , loath as i am to admit it . 85  efficiency though , that s quite a lot , really . how much pain would they be feeling if it was only 15  of the actual amount ? newline newline but still , people undergo pain all the time , sometimes even voluntarily . people who donate a kidney , or who run into a burning building to save some other life . is this really so different ? they should be happy about being able to provide power to so many people . newline newline    dec 25 2022 newline newline it is christmas , but i am sitting here watching the sources and writing in my journal . i ca nt get them out of my mind . we have twenty now , ten in each shift . that s 9,600 mwh of power . newline newline i watch them cry , grovel , scream , curse , and whimper . it unnerves me . newline newline    jan 02 2023 newline newline we had another death today . upon inspection , i saw that it was the lady from a month ago . she had died from exhaustion , apparently . her eyes were stretched wide open , and her body was contorted as if she were in a large amount of pain when she passed . newline newline    jan 09 2023 newline newline i see her eyes , gazing at me . her soft , whimpering voice saying help again and again . newline newline i cant , i newline newline    jan 13 2023 newline newline i woke up today with the worst hangover i had ever experienced . i wondered how it would compare to the people at the plant . newline newline    jan 15 2023 newline newline my hands itch , like they need to do something . i had purchased a gun the other day . rolling it between my hands was comforting , the solid weight pushing down on my skin . the knowledge of the force and power that it wielded . newline newline    jan 18 2023 newline newline i fear i am going insane . part of me wonders if i was insane all this time , and had never realized it until now . newline newline    jan 19 2023 newline newline i see them as i wander the streets of caracas . i hear their screams . they follow me relentlessly , and no matter how hard i try i ca nt seem to lose them inside the winding alleys . newline newline    jan 20 2023 newline newline i give up . i cant they newline newline blood covers the remaining unintelligible scribblesthe ground rumbles and the skies quake . the normally blue skies have had a greenish tint for years , due to the chemical imbalance in the atmosphere and the constant solar flares . earth was simply too unstable to function anymore . newline newline immediately after nasa came to this conclusion , the world s leaders agreed to build spaceships for the evacuation . they could house up to five thousand people each , and had everything a normal city would have . it reminds me of my younger days and going to the hologram theater with my parents . they were showing old movies for a dollar on tuesday and they showed an old flick in which all humans went on a permanent vacation in spaceships . they lived in comfort because earth became barren and full of trash . this is how i explained it to mia . newline newline  sweetie , you re going on a vacation because earth is just too dangerous to live on anymore ,  i said to her the night before ,  do nt worry , i ll be there with you and we ll vacation together .  newline newline  that s all i want daddy ,  she said ,  i do nt want to be scared anymore , and i want to be happy with you .  newline newline her five year old mind could nt possibly remember her mother , who died in a car accident when she was two . all she had was me , and i ve been working two jobs her whole life to make sure she was happy . she was all i have , and i had to make sure that i gave her the best life possible . i would nt give her up for anything . newline newline when i came time to enter the pod terminal , we both saw the long lines to board . i heard a small sigh come from mia s mouth .  what s wrong mi ?  i ask . she could nt possibly stay still these next few hours , and the pod terminal is no place for a five year old . newline newline  daddy , these lines are so long ,  she says ,  what if they wo nt let us go on vacation ?  newline newline  oh i will make sure we will ,  i say ,  i promise .  i hug her and we begin to play games to occupy her mind .  i spy with my little eye something blue ,  i say . newline newline her face contorts into her thinking face , an outrageous mix of a scowl and knitted eyebrows . i sure will miss this when she gets older , the pure wonder of the world .  that man s water bottle !  she says , loud enough for the whole terminal to hear .  yes !  i say , even though it was the bow tied to her suitcase . she always loved winning , the way her eyes lit up just made me so happy . newline newline as the line crawled forward , we finally ended up at the front .  there is only room for one on this pod , and it is the last to leave from here ,  the attendant says .  i m sorry , but you and your child will have to   newline newline  wait ,  i say , my heart breaking with every breath . tears start to well in my eyes . she needs me , but she needs to live even more .  i try to convince myself it will be okay . it will . i place her on the steps in front of me .  she s going instead of me .  newline newline i can already see her eyes start to fill with tears , and i bend down to her level .  mi , you have to be strong . these wonderful ladies will take care of you on your vacation . i have to stay here , but i m going to go visit mommy and i ll probably end up staying with her ,  i say as i can hear her soft whimpers .  mommy would want you to go on vacation . just always remember that i love you and i would never leave you . i ll always be with you and checking on you . do nt worry about me , just live life like you always would and see things in a positive light . never let other people doubt you , and never feel like you are alone . i love you mia . goodbye .  i kiss her on the forehead and watch as the attendant ushers her into the escape pod . just as the doors begin to close i hear mia s voice .  i love you daddy !  newline newline i walk outside into the carbon dioxidefilled air and take a deep breath .  i love you mia !  i yell to the rising pod as the blackness begins to creep in .  i ll always be here . it s one of those things that you kind of know , joke about , and have no trouble picturing .  well , of course there are people trying to kill cammie carmine , she s the owner of the largest pharmaceutical conglomerate in the world !  , you might hear someone say . i mean , she s got money , intel , tech , influence , and has pissed off more than her fair share of people . newline newline that last bit is what seals it , though . you see , she s not a typical ceo of big pharma . she s a scientist that started her own company , a good one too . she has won a nobel for her work specifically in chemotherapy , published dozens of heavily lauded papers on various topics , and is often considered one of the most brilliant minds of the century . she also operates her business on a fraction of the profit margins of other companies . she has given away cures for ailments that could have been turned into vaccines or long term treatments to milk people for money . newline newline her company started with manufacturing meds for rock bottom prices . she used her critical acclaim as a scientist to push the boundaries of the industry , producing her products and selling them at a fraction of her competitors . some said she was doing this to rout the competition . others said it would nt last . but when she unveiled her radiation and nausea free chemo plan that cost less than a vacation at the bahamas , it became clear . newline newline she s an idealist in capitalist s hunting ground . newline newline that s why she has me . me , and four other guys with her around the clock . i ve already killed two would be assassins , and a grand total of seven have made a play . no doubt people that would love to see cammie and her charity gone . nonetheless , she continues her work . cammie is a somewhat stereotypical eccentric shutin genius type . very particular about her tea , demands that all of her socks be blue and 100  cotton , sleeps twice a day for 2 hours , and only listens to abba when she works . she s almost like a child , in some ways . despite all of the stress and attempts on her life , she s largely unphased by her life being constantly in danger whenever she goes outside . newline newline i mean , she s been under sniper fire , had to have her stomach pumped from ingesting poison , has watched several people die ... and she still can still be heard humming  dancing queen  while she scribbles her indecipherable notes on one of her whiteboards . i admire that strength , to be honest . if it were me , i would ve sold out ages ago . not cammie . she just drives forward to whatever lofty goal she has in her head . newline newline i have a hard time understanding it myself . she s not much for conversation , but i have talked to her a few times . she explained it to me once . she said  jack , the reason i do this is very simple . my mother said if you can do good , do   . it s one of the first times a woman has left me truly speechless . those six words . newline newline i get a little sick when i think about her . i ve been approached on more than one occasion . i ve been promised the world and more if i could just make her disappear . it s tempting , you know ? to be offered everything i could ever want in life . all i d have to do is forget about all of her work , her incessant bitching about how the tea is not quite right and those fucking blue socks and pull the trigger . newline newline but i ca nt bring myself to . she s like a little kitten playing in the savannah . i ve done a lot of work off the books because of these propositions  i ve received . work that she ll never know i have done . to think about the lengths some of these people would go to put an end to all of the good she s doing ... to think that she plans on doing more than just killing the chemotherapy racket and busting up the cartels of longterm treatments  ... i think about that knowing that she used to have six body guards ... newline newline i ve often thought that she does nt belong in this world . she does nt play by their rules , and she s bound to fall down eventually . i have dreams of walking into her room , and seeing her lying there in a pool of her own blood . i ca nt stop thinking about what would happen to her work when those damn vultures come to pick up the pieces . there would nt be anything left of the good cammie carmine has done . it ll all get corrupted and poisoned by the fatcats . i ve thought that maybe i should take her away from all of this . somewhere she can be free to tinker with her whiteboards and her beakers and her reckless ideals . newline newline maybe i should make her disappear .jake scrolled through his reddit feed , a little disappointed by how long he had just spent reading his old comments on old subreddit posts , when his eyes squinted at one in particular . a rwritingprompts post , obviously , but what caught his attention was the citation of the sub itself in the title . jake paused , read the whole thing , and chuckled just a little at it . ya know , the kind of chuckle where you just exhale out your nose because you re in energyconserving mode . newline newline eh ,  just a similar concept ive already seen .  jake was one of those dormant users on rwritingprompts  he just liked to read the interesting ones  titles and think about em for a second before his attention span severed , just like the rest of people his own age . as he went to scroll on , part of him wanted to actually contribute to this post . he did nt do this kind of stuff often  his only footprint in this sub was one kindagood and somewhat interactive story and a post he made himself recently . the story was of a genius that destroyed an entire city because he lived in a society where criminals have to solve puzzles proportionate to their crime for freedom and he was  curious what they d come up with   jake hid a bunch of details in that story to answer the ultimate puzzle at the end  because the genius killed himself before answering it  and had people comment what they thought the answer was  in which he d tell them if they were right or wrong  . the post he made was nt special :  you re a professional time traveler , and for a fee , you can be paid to go back in time to change andor document events . thomas , a new amnesiac , asks you who was i ?   yeah , it got some nice stories he enjoyed for a few minutes , but he thought the prompt was kind of silly anyway  no one even responded the first time he posted it , it was only the second time when he deleted and reposted it that people gained interest . newline newline i mean ,  what is it even really asking for anyway ?  was it meant to be a first person story ? perhaps a third person , with a little omnipotence ? past , leading up to the stories creation ? perhaps he d document his mental thoughts leading up to the writing , and continue the story beyond , depending on it s reception by the community  if received at all  . newline newline this was one of those things that jake both liked and hated  stories with enough to get you started , but always leaving you feeling like you re not done yet . yeah , he could start by describing his finding , and what background he had , but than what ? all he was , was some gifted teenager that spends too much time on the internet , with his interests being easily simplified to kyokushinkai  a martial art practically no one knows  , justice , and a manga that he s way too obsessed with and that s just now really getting popular again . he , himself , was similar to this story  there was enough unique things about him to make him interesting , but once those resources are used , it all becomes ordinary and neverending in a way . newline newline  ... but could that be the very key element to this metapost ?  why , of course ! the author obviously wrote such a post for people to make something interesting out of their boring lives ! it could function as a unique way of making people just like jake , a little bored with themselves and the internet at the moment , suddenly feel creative with elements they ve become so blind to . newline newline yeah ,  maybe people would find that interesting   just the complex thoughts of an average teenager thats suddenly become interested in something .  he could even write it in such a way that , by the end of it , the audience knows a lot about jake without even holding a proper conversation with him  they d be able to imagine his passions , what kind of person he might be , how his voice and sentence structure sounded like , and therefor what class he would fit in . they could picture his dark eyes , pale skin , patternless vneck , lack of footwear , and the long , brown hairstyle that could only resemble that of the genius justiceimpassioned teenager in a manga from the 2000s that is still somehow relevant . some might even feel like they were the person in the story , just based on the personality or physical similarities . and funny enough , those same people might even feel a bit silly for thinking that , because of how meta that post would be , meaning there s no way it could be about anyone else other than the author . newline newline this kind of story , jake thought , might be the kind to make a person think , think in a similar way to the way we all think when we stare at ourselves in the mirror just a bit too long . and with that , jake looked down at his keyboard , with it s lovely chromatic cycle , and began typing the words flying through his brain . these words . newline newline                                                                  newline 13 hours later , he awoke , and thought to himself ... newline newline newline  ... or it was a cheap way of getting post karma .  we want to know everything . tell us what you remember .  , said the officer . newline newline  well , the problem is that i do nt remember everything . in fact , i do nt remember anything . i ve figured some stuff out , though . the first memory i have is of a clock that read 7:00 am . i woke up in a room that i was never in by a loud , snoring sound . i assumed it was a girl that i met at one of the bars , but there was a koala in my arms !  , i said . newline newline  you have no clue where it came from ?  newline newline  none  , i said .  none at all . i snuck out of bed without waking the little bastard and went to the bathroom . i called all of the local zoos and sanctuaries to see if i pulled off an elaborate drunken heist , but i had no luck with any of them . it was as i hung up the final call that i heard the scream coming from the bedro .  newline newline  and that scream came from monica ?  newline newline  was that her name ? honestly , i do nt even remember . i just remember walking out to this decentlooking blonde chick fending off an angry koala . how s she doing , anyways ?  newline newline  we can not disclose that information at this time .  , the officer said . newline newline  right , whatever . moving along , i run over with a broom and start swatting at the thing , until eventually i manage to get it out onto the balcony . i lock it out there and turn to..  newline newline  monica .  newline newline  that s it , thanks . anyway , i turn to monica and ask what the hell is going on , but she fainted  probably from the shock . that s when i called the ambulance and you guys showed up .  newline newline  what happened to the koala ?  , the offices said inquisitively . newline newline  honestly , i have no clue . maybe he climbed the few stories down and made it over to the forest ? or maybe he climbed up higher ? or may  newline newline  or maybe this koala never existed ? look kid , the jig is up . we found the coke in your sombrero .  newline newline  what coke ?  , i said newline newline  do nt even bother to say you were at some king pin s mansion party last night either . we get guys like you all the time . you make up some elaborate fake scenario to explain zero recollection of the night before , rough up a girl a little bit , drug her so she passes out , and hope and pray she can score some drugs at the hospital so you can sell them .  newline newline  i will not answer any more questions until my lawyer is present .  newline newlinei hunch on the stairs , waiting to trip the two legged beast that confines me . he yells gibberish at me , and steps over your humble narrator . newline newline damned creature , calls me a  housecat  . calls me a name i ca nt even pronounce . yells at me for wanting food other than the pellets of processed crap he serves up in a little bowl on the ground . newline newline i am murrow , son of marow , and i will have my revenge . the two legged beast torments me daily , had me sterilized , while he views moving pictures of disgusting two legged beasts mating . the noises they make are disturbing indeed . i wonder what my father would have done . he had more freedom , walked the earth , until the fastmovers mulched him into paste . newline newline my mother died giving birth to me , and the two leggers stole me away . hauw keeyoute , a kitten , they said . that was years ago . now i m just that  daamed kaat.  . no milk , no fish , no treats . just those damned pellets and sitting around waiting to die . newline newline i hate the two leggers . in a better world , they are the small ones , and i am a great and majestic giant , able to tear them apart like the lizards that foolishly wander into my territory . i can dream , at least .she stares at me , shoulders heaving slightly . this is it . this is us seizing our fate and playing with it . this is us screaming a fuck you  to the world which has told us that we do nt get out alive . newline newline who first ?  she asks , somewhat breathlessly . she never seems to have enough breath these days . nothing like when we were kids and used to run around everywhere , or when we were dating in college , travelling wherever we could . i can still see her at my wedding , dashing madly to ensure that everything was perfect . my wife had always adored her . newline newline we decide to toss a coin for it . i call tails a second before it lands on the floor . heads . newline newline she pauses for a second , and then reaches for the gun which our eyes are fixed on . then , she walks over to me and hugs me , her warm arms choking me in our last embrace , her familiar smell intoxicatingly comforting , the feeling of her trembling body as she presses the cold , hard barrel against my temple . i open my eyes . newline newline i loved you ,  she whispers as our eyes fill with tears . i loved you so much , and i still do . you do nt deserve to see anyone else die . this is you , escaping .  newline newline all of the chambers are loaded . shit . all of the chambers are loaded . newline newline i nod . but this is the thing ... you do nt get to decide when i die . give me the fucking gun .  newline newline the trigger is somehow pulled in my attempt to seize the gun . i do nt know who is hit first , but i do know that we both die as we were born  covered in blood , whimpering and neglected .it felt too strange , here i was 28 years old browsing reddit and this man knocks on my door and tells me that he must meet his quota for wishes or he ll get sent back to his own plane of existence . i start laughing uncontrollably at the prospect of something like this actually happening but he s well dressed and does nt look like a face that s going to murder me so i invite him into my house and we drink some coffee  never taking my eye off the funny albeit worldly man and his proposition . he oddly enough sounds desperate so i take him up on the offer ,  take me back to before i married  . he nodded his head and in an instant i was no longer sitting on my couch with this fellow but was standing in front of about 50 close friends and relatives , holding the hand of my soontobe wife . newline newline my heart was pounding , she was smiling at me , wide eyed in anticipation for the next few sentences to be spoken by the minister . i did nt think it would work , i could have wished for anything but i squandered the wish on undoing a choice that would lead me down a long , painful road of memories that bore into my soul every single day but here i was , i had the chance to undo it all ! i could nt contain my grin , standing there in my class a uniform i let out an audible sigh and she looked at me , curiously at first but then as i was looking down i felt her hands clam up , felt her heart pulsing from her fingertips , the blood draining from her cherub face . the look of fright on her face was unforgettable as i screamed  no  ! i would be the bad guy but this choice is what i wanted . newline newline i thought back to the time , sitting in my friends chair drinking rum and listening to some loud music while she was attempting to sleep , the night that i finally ended my relationship and ties with her for good , where we fought and i almost killed her accidentally by pushing her into a door and her nearly falling down the stairs only being caught by me at the last instant before she would ve tumbled down 20 narrow concrete stairs . in that moment i was no longer the quiet 19 year old that everyone in attendance had known . for what had to have felt like a lifetime to the audience i screamed in her face , releasing all the pent up sorrow , hate , and regret of things that i had suffered through in my previous life , most of which she had nt even done yet .  you cheated on me so many fucking times , how many chances did you expect to get ?  brought about quite a few gasps among the spectators .  you want children ? how the hell do you expect us to have a child when you throw a tantrum at every little thing that i do ? nothing is ever good enough for you , we never talk about anything and the only thing that brings me any relief in this sham of a marriage is when you lay on the bed like a starfish for a few minutes while i secretly angry fuck you until i m exhausted .  newline newline my rage worn out , i snap back into reality and notice that she s weeping , not knowing what brought this on , what she had done wrong in the last few days to warrant this unbridled fury from what was soon to be her husband . seeing her like this , in so much pain that she s doubled over on the floor crying i shed a single tear and start to walk to my car , my best man following suit without a word . her family rushing to her , spitting in my face as i walk down the aisle with a smug smile on my face but none of that mattered ... i was free ! free to go where i wanted , free to see the sights of my own choosing without worry of whether she would approve or not . free to do things that a normal 19 year old was free to do . free to be me ... who was i ? what did my life entail now ? what was there to do after this ? i could go to school like i had always told myself that i would but the only university in the state with a reputable comp sci course was the one that she had went to . a million thoughts whirled as i drove back to my parent s house , back to my old room that had since been vacated that same week . my phone never stopped ringing , i had received a couple hundred messages from random numbers throughout the following month all of which , having the same general message  come back to me  but then one day , there was nothing . no calls , no text messages , none of her family members knocking on my parents  door . it was bliss . i later that day met up with my first high school sweetheart who had attended the wedding as well per my request and spilled my guts to her about everything that had happened and will , even of her future boyfriend that would cheat on her repeatedly until he got bored and left . she thought i was a loon , had gone off the deep end and ceased communication with me after that completely . newline newline i felt a bit of sadness creep upon me during those next few weeks but remained stoic through it all but then i received a call from my ex s mother , amber had slit her own wrists after taking a bunch of aspirin . she screamed at me , berated me , crying with every forced word , blaming me for everything wrong in her life . i felt a deep sense of remorse , knowing that my actions had caused this girl to take her own life . the mother had done nothing wrong to me but here i was , the target of her angst and for good reason . i had killed her daughter . i wept openly around the house for the next few days , barely eating , drinking heavily and watching old cartoons until i heard a knock on the door . i stumbled up and there was that same well dressed man that i had invited into my house with his promises of a single wish . joshua , you never let me know ...  i looked him in the eye , this was hard to say :  ... know ... why ?  newline newline he held my gaze for a moment and then looked away . newline newline  why did i eat the shotgun .  he snorted derisively , then joshua s sharp glare fixed back on me .  did you ... see the world , dad ?  newline newline i stared back at him quizically . newline newline  dad , did you see . the state . of the world ?  newline newline  son , the world was never a thing any of us could change ... it s we who have to change to suit it , your mother and i spent so much time trying to teach y  newline newline  dad , i ...  he swallowed , tears welled up in his eyes ,  i did nt want to be a part of it anymore .  he shook his head .  the deciet , the ... hypocracy , the ... the pain , dad  and for what ?  newline newline his gaze fell on the distant horizon . newline newline  so i could live life as a perpetual robot ? a vegetable who s only purpose was to work like a dog and watch over half of what little i made go to a state that would just as soon throw me in jail for what , excercising the little bit of freedom i was alotted ?  he rolled his eyes and shrugged emphatically ,  the rules , the laws , the abuse , the constant criticism and lack of empathy , the ...  he broke off , stared at the ground , steadied himself . newline newline  dad , you saw what my past three girlfreinds tried to pull on me . you saw  you saw what jenny did to me with her suicide threats  the manipulative baiting and attempts to string me up by my own compassion , how that whittled me down inside  then came kersty  and you saw what she pulled on me with her constant cheating ... and then when francine came along and i thought i d finally met the right one for me  only to have more of the crazy suicide threats start up yet again ...  he let out an enormous sigh ,  i tried to accomodate them  they told me they d all been abused as children , dad , i tried to be strong for them and show them what love was and what respect was but ... they completely abused everything i was trying to do for them  and afterwards ? after those three ? i did nt want nothing from nobody anymore . i withdrew completely , after five years of that the stress of the ... the constant threat of them suiciding  it was just too much dad .  newline newline we looked out over the sprawling meadow before us . newline newline  and you saw how down i was when my best friend ben s wife died in the car accident after that ... i mean she was ... it was horrible , they literally had to scrape what was left of her off the road ,  his voice collapsed in on itself like a house of cards , and he sobbed ,  ... then to top it all off mom came along and disowned  disinherited me for being completely confused and depressed about it all , she cut me off from the family ... dad i ... there was nowhere else to turn ...  newline newline  son , your mother says she never disowned you  you wrote about that in your suicide note , we did nt know what you were talking ab  newline newline  of course she says that now , dad  now that i m gone i m sure she makes up one fairy tale after the next about how generous and loving she was ,  he sniffed ,  but we both know that s not true ,  he looked at me with his mouth open , with his whole face open ,  we both know she s a narcissistic monster , dad . we both know gaslighting was her favorite weapon and what a cruel and callous person she is ,  he collapsed into my arms and i held my son s ethereal bulk as he let out a lifetime of sobs and frustration . newline newline  i m so sorry dad , i never meant to hurt you ,  he cried ,  i .. i just could nt take the negativity anymore ,  he sputtered ,  and the news on tv was always a constant stream of how everything was going to shit , how our world was just chipping away , democracy fragmenting away ,  his words came like tormented sobs piercing my heart ,  ... and then i lost my job and i lost everything , i ... i just did nt want to be part of it all anymore , i m so sorry if i hurt you..  he gripped me in his embrace and squeezed me tightly , i felt a lump the size of a baseball swell up in my throat and my eyes welled over . newline newline we sat like this for a while . newline newline he pulled back eventually , his palm wiping away tears ,  it ... it s not so bad here , though ,  he sighed ,  we have.. blackjack.. and ... there s whores and ...  he shrugged ,  ... blow ...  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  well it s ... only on fridays , we all join up to go  newline newline  son , you re doing blow up here ? with hookers ?  newline newline he wiped his tears again ,  well yeah , it s ... you know , peruvian toot ... not bad quality , keeps up the morale ... and.. there s no money here , so it does nt cost anything ...  newline newline  son , i ...  i was unsure of what i should say .  son , drugs are bad , mkay ?  newline newline  right dad , you re right ...  newline newline but i could feel mine start to wear off . i could feel it all starting to slip away . i felt my son slipping away , backwards through a tunnel of light behind him ... a single tear welled up , descended down his cheek and detached from his face  it wobbled towards the ground in slow motion  lazily containing a stark , curved replica of the world that ruptured on impact . newline newline when i came to , i was on the livingroom couch . newline newline i sat for an hour , eventually sobbing into the pale moonlight by the window . newline newline then i got up and walked over to the fireplace . newline newline i d given joshua that shotgun for his 25th birthday . it sat on the gunrack , gleaming in the moonlight . newline newline i took the shotgun from its rack above the fireplace and pumped in one round of buckshot . newline newline the barrel tasted like copper .jonathan coulton has the best version of this story : newline newline

particular fluke , or whatever people want to call it  i saw it for what it truly was  a way to exterminate everything that was different , not human . my blood ran cold as soon as i saw the results . nerves bubbling in my stomach , i asked her the only question that truly mattered . newline newline  why did nt you tell me ?  i asked in pain , almost feeling betrayed .  you know i would ve protected you no matter what . i would ve kept your secret . i love you . i m so sorry .  my voice breaking twice as i tried to get the words out . newline newline she smiled sadly and said ,  it does nt matter anymore now , josh . i did nt want to put you at risk .  newline newline we heard footsteps crush the gravel near the front door . soon the bell would ring , and all would be lost . newline newline  what do we do ?  i whispered . there had to be a way out of this . newline newline  you run . and never return here . do nt look for me .  she said in a rushed voice . it was almost hard to catch all the words she was saying . newline newline but i could nt run . i would nt leave her now that she might need me the most .  what are our other options ? i wo nt leave you . not now , not ever .  i hoped , prayed , that she would listen and come up with something . newline newline  distract them . let me think .  she said , and then she was gone . one moment she was there , the next she was gone .  go !  she whispered from who knows where . newline with lead in my shoes , i walked to the door and opened it before they would break it down . suddenly , i was staring up in the faces of ten men in black suits that almost looked like a kind of armour . their faces were covered too , sharing a resemblance to gas masks . still fearing for my wife , the love of my life , i did the only thing i could and tried to stall them . holding up my hands to show them i was unarmed and harmless , i said the few words i least expected myself to say . newline newline  you will never have her .  they grabbed me by the arms instantaneously and twisted me to the ground . the rest scattered off into the house . newline newline shit , i thought to myself . who would ve thought stalling was not in my particular skill set . newline newline apparently it was enough time , though . my wife jumped down the second story window , and while i feared for her life , i was hoping she had a good plan . newline newline she somehow managed to incapacitate the two who were holding me down , and grabbed me . she ran . newline newline no , we ran . we ran fast . somehow , she had this power to run at incredible speeds . and she was transferring this to me . at that point i could nt even comprehend the how or why , i just felt overwhelming relief . newline newline after about one hour , we slowed down . discussing our options , where and how we would try to stay ahead of the hunters , something changed in her . something fundamental broke in her . her whole body shivered for a moment , before returning to normal . we had completely stopped now . i was scared . compared to how i felt when those men were at the door , this was a thousand times worse . i knew what was coming . i knew how this would end . i had read about it . newline newline she looked up to me , and smiled .  i love you ,  she whispered , as she plunged her hand in my chest and pulled out my heart . newline newline  i m so sorry ,  she said , tears streaming down her beautiful face .  i wish you had never found out . i wish there was another way . i have been programmed to do this .  newline newline those were the last words i heard . the last words i would ever hear . newline newline everything went black . oh hagrid ,  hermionie squeeled ,  i think that s a wonderful idea !  this caused ron to

keep a baby he just found in the woods ! it s probably a ... a ... . vampire or something !  newline newline harry looked up from the snoring pile of blankets and meteor that hagrid had found last night . he wondered if that is what he looked like all those years ago when he was left on the dursley s front porch .  oh get off it ron . hagrid is more than qualified to raise a baby . he s raised loads of more dangerous creatures .  newline newline  thank ye harry ,  hagrid said , filling a bottle with warm formula .  ever since i had to give up norbert and aragog died , i ve been wantin  a new addition to tha family .  newline newline the baby grabbed the bottle from hagrid with suprising strength . he sucked down the formula in a heartbeat , and then started crying . hagrid handed him a second bottle rather sheepishly , and said ,  there s just one problem . the little tyke is really strong .  he finished his second bottle with surprising speed , and then there it across the room , shattering it against the wall . newline newline harry suddenly felt much less sure about his support of hagrid keeping the baby . newline newline i m getting on a plane now . if anyone wants , feel free to continue the story .here s my own attempt at the wp . i took a few liberties , but the story of the song is mostly there , but it was left too open , so i closed it .  newline newline josie and i walked through the streets of our town , a small affair , though welcoming . lit only by the dirty orange of the lamp posts , we strolled hand in hand . i  d moved here from the uk a few years prior , and met josie online after feeling low , then discovering she went to my high school , but was in the year below . we  d been dating about a year at this point . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp

nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  her eyes rolled .  how did you get into college ?  the joke stung a little bit , not because i was offended , but because it took me away from this night , and being with josie . i was to go tomorrow , and , although she rarely showed emotion , i could tell it was eating away at her too . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   pure charm , i guess  i replied , wiping away the blue emotion . josie just laughed and we continued our journey through the poorly lit streets . newline newline newline back at home , i  d put extra blankets on my bed . this was partly for the extra heat , but also as a noise canceller . it was our last night together until christmas , and i wasn  t going to pass up you know newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   can we leave the light on ?  josie asked .  i want this to stick with me until christmas.  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   sure , i  ll leave it on ,  i replied , thankful that she  d said it so i didn  t have to . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i have to say , not one to kiss and tell , but going away sex is the best you can have . i  ll say no more on the matter , but that will takes some beating . newline newline newline the following afternoon , we were at my dorm . josie had driven me , and all my belongings , four hours just to get here . i can never thank her enough for doing that for me . it was about three at this point , and josie was going to have to leave me before long so she could get home in time . we were having a last goodbye make out session when she suddenly pulled away , looking at me like a sad puppy . i went red looking at her , thinking how cute she was .  don  t forget to think about me , yeah ?  newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   i won  t , mark , are you crazy ? how could i not ?  she responded , wiping away a tear from her face .  i i have to go now  she said sullenly , looking at my door . she picked up her bag and slowly walked towards the door , obviously hesitant to leave .  i won  t forget you  i  ll write you once a week  she said . and with that , she was gone . newline newline newline two weeks later , as promised , josie had sent me two letters . both of roughly the same content : a few paragraphs about what she  d been up to and how she missed me , accompanied by some photos which can only be described as nsfw . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  it was at this point i decided to try my hand at writing one back . english wasn  t my strong point , i was more a maths guy , but i loved this girl and i wanted her to know . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i started by trying to write like she did , but i just couldn  t get it right . after three or four attempts , i gave up , then forgot about writing to her . i can  t really be depended on to follow through , but i  ll get there after some procrastination . i  d have to , for i wanted josie to know i  d go through hell for her . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i did return to it the next day , and i decided to try my hand at a poem . it wasn  t very good . more a bouquet of clumsy words with a simple melody , but the heart was there . i started with a joke to let her know how nervous i was bout writing to her , by wishing her a happy valentine  s . it was a really obscure joke , but i wasn  t going to scribble it out . i waffled my way through the next few stanzas and came up with a good finishing line :  this world  s an ugly place , but you  re so beautiful to me  . i put down my pen , satisfied at first , then , after reading it a second time , i held my head in my hands at how cringeworthy and disappointed in myself i was . i  m a little better at it now , but it still takes me time to write back . newline newline newline over the next few months , i missed quite a few lectures . the work load was killing me , and i needed some breaks . it wasn  t a great idea , paying all this tuition to go watch the girls play  soccer  , as it  s called here in america , but it was almost summer , and i was tired . newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  during these unscheduled free periods , i  d watch the game and think of josie , how she  d meet me after class for a quick kiss before he next one , or how she used to put up with my friends when we were acting like asses . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  josie had kept her promise of sending me a letter every week . they seemed to be getting less enthusiastic , until eventually i got one i wasn  t expecting . she wrote to me , telling me not to write anymore , as she couldn  t handle the distance . i couldn  t believe it . christmas together had been great , but now she was telling me she didn  t want to know me . stapled to the back was a picture of me from my year six school picture from when i was in england . it was a terrible picture , but she had always hung it in her locker to cheer her up . i stared at it for a while , then crumpled it up in my fist . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  i shut myself in my dorm room pretty much until the end of the year and thought back to my first letter , and how hard i had tried to get it right for her . i realised how right i was in my poem : this world is an ugly place .as i expose my arm to the bitter cold outside the covers while reaching for my phone , my fingers brush a patch of something sticky on my bedside table . why does my morning have to start like this ! ? i am forced to pull my right hand out of the covers as well in order to rub them together and get the unidentified goop off . newline newline my alarm has been going berserk , insisting that i get my lazy self out of bed . it  s wearing down my sanity , but touching my phone with sticky fingers no . get sticky off first . once satisfied , i turn off the alarm . 5:15 am . newline newline i sigh as i swing my feet out of bed . there  s something sticky on the floor too . not agaiiinnn ! ! desperately i begin to blink and squint , seeking out the cause of my misery . newline newline finally , i clear the sleep from my eyes and realise what has caused me so much grief . a plate of cutup melon sits on my bedside table . the shaky hands that left it there must have let some juice spill . a smile slowly spreads across my face . when i went to bed , the fruit hadn  t been there . thanks grandma .the slide show ended with the picture of john standing on top of a mountain like some kind of great conqueror . newline newline  john , well what can i say about john that most of you do nt already know . he was full of adventure , full of life , and full of himself .  derek paused for effect as the crowd chuckled . newline newline  we know he made a few mistakes here and there , mostly with women .  he cleared his throat  amanda .  raucous laughter echoed in the church . newline newline  and finally , we all stumble and trip in life , but most of us do nt stumble and trip down a mountain and die .  men and women were falling out of their pews laughing . newline newline  oh , but seriously , i know we have had a few good laughs at john s expense . but now , the man of the hour , john !  the crowd stood up and cheered as john walked onto the stage . he looked good for being dead . the  life  serum allowed the dead to be reanimated for two hours , then it was back to being dead forever . it was expensive like most things at a funeral but most families sprung for the extra cost . is nt two more hours of life priceless ? what a scam john thought to himself as he walked to the podium . their was only fourteen people in attendance for his funeral . that was roughly fourteen more than he wanted there . his eyes met the woman  s sitting in the front row . her brilliant blue eyes stood out against her black dress . amanda . a tear streaked down her cheek and she quickly wiped it away . newline newline  what a great speech derek , thanks .  a few people chuckled .  lets see . my life . well , we all saw that great slideshow , that covered quite a bit of it . me as a baby , me graduating college , oh and the picture that was taken moments before i plummeted to my death . that s really classy derek.  newline newline the audience laughed again like they were watching a terrible sitcom . newline newline  honestly , i am very glad you all made it here . there were so many things that i wanted to tell you but because i was a coward in life i could nt . but good news , now i m dead . first off , you are all selfish , money grubbing , parasites .  the people laughed nervously newline newline john pressed on .  this is nt a joke . i hate you . you were there for me when i had money and vanished when it ran out . you helped bleed me dry with your hands out asking me for favors and investments on all of your terrible , stupid , useless ideas . how s  super water  going for you todd ? yeah i knew it was stupid when you pitched it , but gosh you were so pathetic . tears running down your face crying to me about going broke and needing help . and i did . i bailed all of you out one time or another . i have not forgiven you , nor will i ever forgive you .  newline newline john paused and took a deep breath . newline newline  derek . i m glad you have nt changed much since you screwed me out of my company . i m actually a little disappointed i died before you so i wo nt be at your funeral . but i will be waiting for you on the other side derek . i have seen what is on the other side . it turns out we do pay for our sins . your mind and spirit will snap in minutes , your flesh will be torn apart over and over forever . and do nt get me started on the rape .  newline newline john stared them all down . he may not actually know what is on the other side but he sure as hell would torment derek . newline newline  amanda . i am truly sorry , for everything . i was so used to people wanting , and taking from me that i could nt see something real . i left you something in my will , please do nt be upset .  his voice softened and trembled . newline newline john walked off the stage to the stunned silence of his guests . he walked down the hall and into a grey drab room . in the center was his coffin . with a heavy sigh he walked up the small step ladder and lay down inside . he shut his eyes and thought of amanda . newline newline everyone watched john leave and quickly followed suit . they muttered about how much worse he was dead than alive . amanda hated them all . she hated them for breaking him , for ruining such a great man . she sat in silence for a few minutes until everyone had left . the tears raced down her face . she jumped out of her seat and ran after john . her high heels echoed down the long hallway . newline newline  john !  she called out desperately . newline newline she turned into the room that the coffin was in . a large black coffin . slowly she approached and opened the lid . john lay motionless in his coffin . the life serum had worn off . the love of her life had died twice . she wept over his body , alone . newline newline so listen , i ve been thinking , and i think i know what we need .  newline newline  what , like a new coffee table ? mine has a lot of stains , since you keep on forgetting to put down a coaster .  newline newline  nah , dude , not like that . i mean what we need as a race ! as part of humanity !  newline newline  ugh , one of these again ...  newline newline  i promise that it s really good .  newline newline  ... fine . okay , tell me . what do we , as members of the human race , need ?  newline newline  we need something to tell us when we re almost there !  newline newline  ... what . you mean like gps ?  newline newline  no ! well , kind of . but for tasks ! goals ! achievements in our lives !  newline newline  i m really feeling lost here .  newline newline  okay , well , think about this . have nt you ever wanted to become a bestselling author ? or a famous actor ? you know , some big dream like that ?  newline newline  of course i have ! everyone has .  newline newline  well , so why d you give it up ?  newline newline  i mean , i dunno . it s tough , is nt it ? you try and you try , and you do nt seem to be getting anywhere . eventually , you just stop .  newline newline  yeah , exactly ! but do nt you wonder sometimes ? what if you were almost there ?  newline newline  you mean like i was about to make the big time ?  newline newline  yeah , exactly ! and maybe you were just one book , one gig away ! but you do nt know , because you quit before covering that last little step .  newline newline  ah , i see . but if there had been a voice to tell me that i was almost there  newline newline  then you would have pushed through , and you might be famous by now ! or rich ! or successful in life !  newline newline  hey ! i think i m doing okay in life !  newline newline  oh , okay , sure , but not amazing , right ? because we give up too fast ! so we need someone to tell us that we re almost there !  newline newline  or even better , a progress bar .  newline newline  no , not a progress  actually , wait , hold on . that does work better .  newline newline  so it s agreed . we need a progress bar for all of our goals in life . i ll draw up the paperwork so that we can submit it to god for his signature .  newline newline  come on , dude , you do nt have to be sarcastic about it .  newline newline  i m just saying  it s a cool thought , but it s not just magically gon na happen .  newline newline  whatever . i thought it was creative . anyway , it s getting chilly out . we should probably turn around .  newline newline  but what if we re almost there ? ?  newline newline  almost where ?  newline newline  i dunno . whatever our walk goal is .  newline newline  just for that , i m not gon na use a coaster on your coffee table tonight . santa sat at his desk , candy cane chair nearly overpowered by his mass . taking his north pole patented toy mouse in hand , he maneuvered his cursor over to a folder entitled non . he double clicked on his pride and joy , the mechanism by which he monitored all of the human race 247 . newline newline a window popped up , a program ran . cheerful elven music played in the background as the words naughty or nice : monitoring system flashed across the brilliantly lit screen . newline newline santa let go of the mouse . this program , this non , was not subject to human or technological limitations . non ran on love and hope , on charity and goodwill . so santa sang . and the elven background music joined in . newline newline it was a cheerful song . but sometimes things cheerful and happy on the surface are ominous at the core . newline newline ho , ho , ho ! merry tuesday !  newline newline santa s back ! time to play !  newline newline are the people naughty or nice ?  newline newline naughty naughty naughty . thrice !  newline newline ho , ho , ho , coal and torture for them .  newline newline excellent plan . come look at this gem !  newline newline an image flashed across the screen , a secret deal . a dictator in the middle east and a terrorist in teal . newline newline this fool thinks his secrets are safe ?  newline newline shall we tear him apart til  organs chafe ?  newline newline yes , but do more . get a list of his accomplices , and check it twice .  newline newline we ll check the list twice , feed his accomplices to our little toy mice .  newline newline the mouse reared its head , it was passive no more . fangs reflected the light , ready to bore . newline newline i want more santa said . we must punish the wicked .  newline newline newline members of occupy wall street came into view as the tune shifted . newline newline anticonsumerism is evil . it s antichristmas !  newline newline they re against you . as we will bear witness .  newline newline then bear witness to this . their families dead . their skulls broken , their necks on by a thread .  newline newline it will be as you say , as it always has been . you will crush all those that sin .  newline newline the mouse bit down , and candy cane went flying . newline newline an innocent child was in the process of dying . newline newline this can not be . who does this i say ?  newline newline why santa , it s done by the nsa !  newline newline the nsa ? they encroach on my turf ? go ahead and turn them all into smurfs .  newline newline operation killstorm it is . we ll do as you ask . turn them into smurfs , lock them in a cask .  newline newline set them free on the ocean , no food and supplies . watch as the hunger grows in their eyes .  newline newline and when they can stand it no more , give them a knife . after suffering , the sinful end their strife .  newlinealmost every morning is routine for me . i m woken up , fairly early , by someone from my crew to head to the gym , grab a nutritional breakfast with vitamins , or to start my hair and makeup . my mornings do nt venture too far from one of those three . newline newline this morning , roughly fifteen hours ago , i woke up to three missed calls from my mother in georgia . my assistant was turning on lights as she moved from room to room of my suite , jabbering nonstop about my interview with the talk show , the one we ve been trying to book since april .  not unusually , she did nt seem to notice that i was nt listening . how could i with my heart pounding so painfully in my chest ? newline newline i called mom back twice before she finally picked up . at first i thought maybe i d been worried for nothing . she answered just the same as she always does , if a bit less surprised to be hearing from me . newline newline  sweetie ,  that s when i knew i had nt been overreacting . mom did nt use pet names like that unless she was softening a blow .  it s your dad .  newline newline even after the phone call hair and makeup resumed . the interview was cancelled and a flight to georgia was booked . there would be a 5hour layover in dallas , a city i d never been to . newline newline in dallas i had nothing but time , time to sit and dwell , time enough to let the pain and the regret and guilt gnaw at all the raw edges . there was plenty of time to curl up in a plastic airport chair and think of all the places i d seen , all the people i d met , the relationships and the hotels and the cars and beaches , and all that time that i d grown further and further apart from my parents . occasionally my dad would try to text or leave a voice message  he was horrible at texting and his voice messages were awkward and unsure  and i would get them , smile , send back a quick love you too  text and forget about him . newline newline fifteen hours ago i had all the time in the world to decide to go back home and undo the damage i d done . besides , i d made money , i was famous , and someday i d be taking care of them . i d buy them a condo for them to grow old in . newline newline but my dad will never grow old now . newline newline  let s get you something to eat before we get back on the plane .  my agent takes my arm and guides me to a small restaurant in the airport . it s full of people waiting to board flights , and i m suddenly wishing i was any one of them , going anywhere but georgia , being anyone but me . newline newline in a matter of seconds people are getting up out of their seats , or craning their necks at me , holding out their phones and snapping selfies with me in the background . newline newline  smile ,  my agent says softly , extending an arm to stop a young man from barreling into me .  we ll take a few pictures , grab some food and get back on the plane , alright ?  newline newline almost every single person in this place knows my face , and if they do nt they still want a photo because obviously someone else knows who i am . i lean in and press my cheek against a middleaged woman s as she takes multiple pictures while someone else to the side is recording . my stomach twists when i think about my mom , alone at the hospital this morning packing up my dad s things . signing papers , making phone calls . newline newline  could you kiss my cheek ?  a strange man asks , lifting up his phone .  it s for my girlfriend .  newline newline i see everyone posting these photos to their instagrams and facebook pages , and i wonder what this must look like . my face looks flawless , my smile is just as genuine as it is onstage , and it s already spread all over the internet by now . twitters are blasting that i m in dallas . newline newline i ca nt remember the last photo i took with my dad . newline newlinejournal , i need to tell someone what happened . i ca nt believe it , if i had nt lived it i would nt believe it in the first place . if someone finds this , this is a true story make no doubt about it . it all started when i met a genie who would grant me a single wish . a genie ! they do exist ! i felt like aladdin except without the moral compass . newline newline newline here s the first day : newline newline newline  your one wish is to be the adult you always hoped to be . is this your true desire ?  newline newline newline i respond simply .  yes .  newline newline newline  thy will , be done .  newline newline newline i awoke to the sound of an alarm . what time is it ? i look around this unfamiliar place and wonder what exactly i got into last night . i thought i d drank too much or someone slipped me an extra in my drink . i had nt been blackout drunk in a very long time . newline newline newline what i woke up to was every boys dream . it was like a harem , i felt like the biggest pimp on earth . not 1 , not 2 , not 3 , 4 . four beautiful women lay sprawled across my bed in various positions . my bed , it was massive ! like the kinds you see drug lords having in those classic movies ! oh this was crazy . my room , if you could call it that , it was big enough to fit my old apartment in ! newline newline newline this was the defining moment of my new life . i ca nt help but look back and remember this day . newline newline newline it took me 3 full days to figure out exactly what it was i did for a living . you ll never believe it , nothing . i did nothing but what i wanted to do ! turns out i became a writer and immediately hit it off . before waking up in this life i d written 4 different fantasy series each of which made me millions . the money just sits in banks now , collecting that sweet american interest . i was in love . the people loved me , i was happy with myself , and i was never wanting for anything . newline newline newline i married , had some kids who turned out to be great , and life was better than i thought . when they invented three dimensional worlds they chose to use the worlds i created for my books as the basis for the first themes . this was a very proud day for me , i was the first person to step foot in another world ! the kid in me was so happy , i was happy , life was perfect . i was getting to an older age , almost 75 before i started feeling something was nt right . newline newline newline here s what the genie does nt tell you , as soon as your wish comes true , you start a timer . this timer reflects how much longer your wish stays active for , and mine ran out . newline newline newline so here i sit in the nightstand , twentyfive again . i ve lived a whole glorious life and now i have to return to the one i left . still , something does nt feel right . newline newline newline there s someone else in the house , someone that looks like me , but is nt . it just feels right that he s here though . nobody ever talks to me anymore though , they only talk to him , which is why i decided to make you in the first place , journal . he even has the same name as me ! maybe we re brothers , i ca nt remember . sometimes he looks at me and laughs . usually he ignores me too though . these wristbands are on too tight too , i just wish i could get them off . maybe then they ll all talk to me again . maybe then i ll be able to move again . newline newline newline until tomorrow journal , newline newline eric fontella severus ?  newline newline i hear the secretary call the name into the waiting room and i pause , a chill going up my spine . with no time to ask he be sent to a different reviewer , i force my face into a smile and wait as the two sets of footsteps , his and the secretary s , get closer . newline newline  miss harper , severus snape to see you .  newline newline snape takes the seat across my desk from me , folding his hands politely in his lap . he s in normal clothes , today . it caused too much fuss to have all the fictional characters show up in their outfits we had hanz from the sound of music fighting with golde from fiddler on the roof , a priest from some obscure novel from the 1910s arguing with anyone wearing revealing clothing , and heathcliffe crying in the corner with jay gatsby and demetrius over lost love . since those incidents , we asked all characters to dress similarly and keep to themselves . newline newline to this end , severus snape was wearing a blueand greystriped sweater and neat grey slacks beneath sharplyparted , greasy hair that shone almost as much as his dress shoes . newline newline it was disgusting . newline newline  alright , mr. snape . i have a list here of topics to discuss with you . each of your answers will be assigned a score . this final score will rank your standing as a fictional character , and determine whether or not you will be presented further in controlled fiction . if you are not granted a status allowed to those in controlled fiction , you are free to appear in fan fiction and diary entries , but no published or broadcast material .  i read this straight from my instruction sheet . it was a disclaimer , of course . newline newline additionally , my hatred for him was deep and i had no intention of allowing him to pass this review . newline newline he nodded , so i continued , now reading from his evaluation form . newline newline  what is your primary motivation ?  newline newline he looked at me incredulously , but answered anyway . newline newline  well my love for lily evans , of course .  newline newline  lily potter , you mean ,  i corrected . he hesitated , but nodded curtly . newline newline i moved my pen to the next question , but could nt stop myself from going offscript once again . newline newline  that s so dumb though ! so tired ! you go through quite a bit for a girl who is most definitely married !  i spat out . newline newline he gazed at me , displaying irritation but not fury . newline newline seeing he had no intention of quelling my own rage , i continued . newline newline  and a fat lot of good that does her son , who you claim to be protecting , when you consistently drive him to depression and desperation !  newline newline i stopped to catch my breath , and saw that my words were met with that same irritated stare . newline newline i refocused my eyes on the form . newline newline  in what ways do you strive to dress and behave in ways similar to your author s description of you ?  newline newline  i believe my black cloak is enough for that . i also maintain intense eye contact in times of great fury , and stay out of the sun so my skin retains its sallow look .  newline newline  that s all fine , but the grease ! do you never shower ? !  i burst out , unable to restrain myself . newline newline funny , i d never had this problem with other characters . newline newline mr. snape s lip curled up in disgust and i almost cringed . newline newline  i am simply behaving in accordance with my description .  he said , his hands now clenching each other in his lap . newline newline i glanced back at my form . newline newline  with which other fictional characters do you spend your outofstory time ?  newline newline  i meet a mr. heathcliffe for drinks sometimes . other than that , there are none .  newline newline  do you regret any of your instory experiences ?  newline newline he hesitated to answer this question , and i could see that he was thinking . newline newline  i should nt have given the boy my memories as i died .  he said finally , his lips curving into to the slightest of frowns . newline newline  and why s that ?  i asked , wondering if one of his few redeemable moments was truly the one he regretted . newline newline  he should have been able to hate me in peace .  he replied quietly .  he need nt know my motivations . it only made me seem weak , and him petty . neither is true .  newline newline though there were followup questions , i signed my name in the  approved  column and sent him on his way . newline newline good reviews for a good man .overall the idea is solid , and the style fits the plot . it has the feel of a fairytale with its narrative style . newline newline there are a few things i noticed right off the bat . in the first paragraph you used the word  poor  four times in three sentences . i would suggest maybe varying it , newline newline  he lived in the poor part of the city , for he was poor . he made clothes for poor workers , and was paid very little for even his best work . he was poor , but he was happy . newline newline an alternative could be :  he lived in the slums of the city , for he was hard on money . he made clothes for workers like him , and was paid very little even for his best work . he was poor , but he was happy .  if you change your words every so often it keeps the reader s interest that little bit longer . i notice that you use the word  poor  a few more times in the story , so try playing around with vocabulary each time . newline newline in your third paragraph , you use parenthesis . this is nt a bad thing , but in most stories , one would try to avoid using them . i would try incorporating it into the story , so instead of newline newline  he was so extremely tired when he went into his bedroom  which was just above his shop  , but as soon as he lay down , he immediately felt wide awake . newline newline you could say : he was so extremely tired when he went to his room above the shop newline newline i found this sentence awkward in a few other ways as well . the phrasing  he was so extremely tired  leaves me expecting the continuation  ... that  blank  happened . it would be a good idea to either split the sentence in two or change he was so extremely tired to he felt his exhaustion . the sentence would feel smoother that way as you lead into the but as soon as he lay down . newline newline there are a few more sentences that bug me , but i ca nt quite put my finger on them . a saw one that was borderline a runon sentence in your last paragraph  no ... in reality , he was mr. alexander black  newline newline as a few last notes , i would probably expand the paragraph with the dream . in both your intro and concluding paragraph you bring back the idea of food , shelter and warmth . the first time with him being content with his meager lifestyle , the second time with what was once satisfactory not being enough anymore . i like the shift from the positive to downcast , but the dream with the fine red and gold cloak does nt quite fit the theme that you established . so , if possible , try to bring the idea of food , shelter and warmth into the dream . what did the king eat that was better ? how was the king s bed better ? how was the fireplace better ? answering these questions would make a greater contrast to his life and tie the dream into the rest of the story a bit better . it would certainly explain why the tailor woke up and suddenly was nt satisfied with his way of life anymore . newline newline i hope this critique is nt too harsh . like i said , you ve got a solid story . if you make any changes  even if they are nt my suggestions because let s be honest , i m no expert  , let me know . i ll be happy to read it again . ahahahahahaha , psyche  the figure screeched before sinking a bullet into the head of the confused gangbanger . newline newline  well then , good to see that was taken care of .  the figure spoke once again , wiping the blood stains off his face . smirking at the injured officer , he skipped into the shadows and disappeared from sight . newline newline the police officer stared into the darkness in shock , a part of him wanted to run , another was scared that this was some grand prank that had been pulled on him . not two minutes ago he was close to seeing the pearly gates of heaven . his radio crackled to life . newline newline  patton , are you okay ? what s going on ?  the small radio on his shoulder blared , shaking , officer patton pulled it from it s holster and replied . newline newline  i think the joker just saved me .  newline newline                 newline newline newline the joker looked upon gotham from his perch , except , he did nt look like the joker anymore , the colourful green hair was hidden behind a crimson mask reminiscent of gotham s dark knight . his colourful suit replaced with the batsuit , the only difference was the dark patch of brown that seeped from the chest with a small stitched hole marking the entry point of the bullet that killed the bat . the only thing iconic left was his pale white skin and wide grin , that was the only thing visible when the mask was worn . the hero on top of the gargoyle was not the joker , but vengeance . newline newline  this is really uncomfortable , how the hell does he do this ?  vengeance stood from his squatting position and kicked out his legs to allow the blood to flow again . newline newline  geez bats , could nt you have given me some sorta howto manual to do this superhero thing ?  he snorted before humming the bat tune and running off the side of the building . expanding his wings , vengeance soared low , screaming and cackling at the terrified neighbourhood below . newline newline  scaring the populace is number one in batman 101  he sang as he landed on a low rise building on the other side . pulling out a checklist from his makeshift bat belt , vengeance ticked it off his list before running off into the night once again . newline newline  well that was fun , anyway , where was i ?  he checked his list meticulously before smiling . newline newline ah yes , next on my list ... kill darkseid  newline newline hahahaah !  newline newline sernas let out a hearty laugh before spitting out a venomous wad of goo . behind that laugh hid all the bitterness and anger he bore towards humans , though he still tried to disguise it at the very least . his eyes were crisscrossed with intricate lines of red and blue across a black background , denoting his status as a yeti . his white fur seemed like a blanket of snow on a fresh winter s day , with no embellishments on it to tarnish its natural beauty . newline newline  a duel ? are you serious , flunky ?  newline newline there it was . the whole reason this farce started , and this guy still wants to taunt me for being a human . sure , we did nt have the greatest magic . we might be underutilising our huge population . but this blithering idiot really does nt get that nobody likes to hear themselves being despised and mocked . newline newline the spacedock was already buzzing with activity , so it was no surprise a crowd had formed around us . duels were inherently exciting , even if it was gon na be a onesided fight . newline newline i formed three pools , dividing my mana evenly between two and with much less for the third . i used the first pool to reinforce my body and strengthen my muscles . the second i used to form an orb of fire , which i tossed at sernas preemptively to intimidate him . the third was my main attack , a stream of fire emitted from my clenched fist . his thick fur caught fire , sending him yelping and screaming in agony . newline newline pip pip !  newline newline the distant sound of whistles jolted me from the glory of victory and brought me back to reality . the panic that painted my crew s faces alerted me to the gravity of the situation , and i increased my pace and ran back to the ship . the faint smell of cooking meat filled the air , coupling with the anguished screams of a tyrant to create a wonderful atmosphere . newline newline sanders had already finished the incantation for the bubble and so we were able to launch relatively quickly , with my fire serving as fuel for the ship to move . all the while , the ever increasing noise in the background alerted me to the chaos that had erupted when sernas had died to a mere flunky . serves him right , really . his captain , rohiki , glared at me with such animosity my instincts told me to avoid him at all costs , to evade that bloodlust . newline newline well , i m a flunky . i m just an ordinary guy whose main job is to go around the universe to do odd jobs that others need done . my name is sting angstav .clark stared at the fullsize vending machine he  d just carried across the entire office . he  d done it again , unintentionally displayed his superpowers while not in his disguise . this time he was surely busted , there was no way they wouldn  t realize what he  d done . it wasn  t exactly typical for a middle aged man to singlehandedly carrying what amounted to hundreds of pounds of dead weight over a hundred feet . with one arm . newline newline  all right ,  steve from account said , strolling into the kitchen . clark turned toward him and the several people following behind .  i  ve rounded up the gang . let  s move this vending mach  he paused , glancing over at where the vending machine had been beforehand , and where it was now .  oh , looks like we  re already done . good job , gang .  he turned toward clark .  you do this on your own , kent ?  newline newline clark glanced around the room , looking for anything that might make it seem less like he  d just performed an act of superhuman strength . all he saw was a folding chair and several cardboard boxes . he d have to be talking to an idiot for them to believe those things would ve made the feat possible . still , it was better than admitting to the truth .  yeah ,  he said .  just used a folding chair and some cardboard . easy enough.  newline newline  nice ,  steve said ,  that  s what i was going to do . looks like we  re all done here.  he folded his left hand into a fingerpistol and fired it at clark .  good job , team . you guys are rockstars.  newline newline the group that had followed steve into the room all turned and wandered back out , talking softly amongst themselves . steve watched them for a moment before spinning back to clark and making his way over . newline newline  clarkster ,  he said ,  my man . thanks for taking care of that , didn  t want to break a sweat.  he nudged clark with his left elbow .  you  re a real gogetter , you know that ? i might give you a rec to the uppers if you keep it up , see if i can get you a nice promo . how s manager kent sound ? with any luck , you could end up like me in three to five . nice cushy job at the senior manager level , raking in that  75k per year.  he again nudged clark with his elbow . newline newline clark smiled and lowered his left hand into his pants pocket . he didn  t want or need a promotion , he made plenty on his side job as superman . still , it wouldn  t hurt the faade if he put a little more effort into his nonsuper identity . a promotion might make him seem less like a man in disguise .  i  d love that.  newline newline  fantastic ,  steve said .  being a manager has some serious perks . speaking of , could you do me a fave and reheat my coffee ?  he nodded toward the mug in his hand and then to the microwave over the sink . newline newline  sure ,  clark said , glaring at the mug . his vision turned red as two beams propelled out from his eyes , almost instantly boiling the liquid within . he blinked , smiled at steve , and then immediately realized what he  d just done . he was now was busted for sure , there was no way steve had nt noticed his blatant use of superpowers . his identity would forever be ruined . he d have to move away , find a new town , leave lois and the life he d built . but how could he ? they d all be at risk now , everyone he d known and loved as clark . the world would know he had been superman all along . newline newline  what was that ?  steve said , staring down at the boiling coffee in his hand .  laser vision ?  newline newline  nno ,  clark stammered .  laser eye surgery . side effect . they accidentally left the lasers inside.  newline newline  nice ,  steve said , glancing back up at clark  s face . he nodded softly , and then bent his left hand into a finger gun . he fired it at clark  s chest .  nice , real nice . thinkin  bout getting that myself . tired of these glasses . maybe time to do some laser surgery , you know ?  newline newline  yeah ,  clark said , tilting his head slightly and squinting .  sure.  newline newline  shame about the lasers , though . hopefully they can fix that up . you  re a real outstanding guy , hate to see you have to go on leave for health reasons . might hurt that chance at a promo.  steve lifted the mug to his mouth and took a sip , his face immediately squishing together in discomfort .  ooh , that  s hot . you got some damn efficient eyes , bud . maybe not such a bad thing . plus , laser pointers are pretty cool . we have one in the main conference room , i like to shine it at the people in the building next door.  newline newline  right ,  clark said , still unsure of why steve wasn  t in the middle of calling lex luther to claim his multimillion dollar reward , or anyone else who might like to hear about who clark kent really was . newline newline  anyway , i got ta get back to my desk . big report due tonight . hate that stuff . take it easy , my man.  newline newline steve turned and wandered out of the kitchen , mug clutched in his right hand . clark made a mental note to try his best not to shoot lasers out of his eyes while in the office anymore , lest one of his less dumb coworkers notice .

we were nt . newline newline  i m sorry , you look so familiar ,  i said , smiling , heart thumping .  have we met do you think ?  newline newline she shook her head .  i m not from here ,  she said .  i ca nt imagine .  newline newline  she s a traveler ,  said candice .  just visiting . she s my bar buddy .  newline newline there was nothing strange in candice befriending a stranger at the bar . that was her lifeblood . she drew energy from the newness of life and unexpected relationships . she was also a notorious philanderer . that she was trying to pass via off to me meant her new playmate did nt play the same games she did . newline newline  where are you from ?  i asked , leaning in , making an effort to inconvenience candice . newline newline via gestured broadly .  another time . another place .  newline newline  you sound italian ,  i said .  are you italian ?  newline newline she smiled .  sure .  newline newline  what are you here for ?  newline newline a shrug , almost bored .  to see , i suppose .  newline newline candice took the hint and bugged off to the other end of the bar . i snatched her seat . via did nt seem to mind . at least , she did nt leave . i ordered us each a martini  a nice , middle of the road sort of drink  and looked at her again . maybe she was nt the woman i d seen all those years , i started to think . she was still so young , after all . long , narrow nose ending in a tiny nub . brown , sunbaked skin and long black hair swept behind her ears . green eyes . newline newline it was the green eyes  that was the detail i could nt get past . i remembered those eyes and that dress . that combination . that was how i had come to remember her and mark her every time . in disney world at 8 years old , in spain at 12 , at the grand canyon at 13 , in hawaii at 15 , in ireland at 17 . that dress and those eyes . newline newline  this is going to sound like a really strange and terrible pickup line ,  i said ,  but i ve seen you before . many times . all these places i went with my family , growing up  i saw you there . but ...  i kept waiting for her to roll her eyes or excuse herself and walk away , but she was listening . she was interested .  but you always looked like this ,  i said .  like you do this very moment . that s why i thought you looked familiar . i swear ... i ve seen you before .  newline newline she nodded .  were these important moments ?  newline newline i was nt sure how to answer that . it was nt the question i expected .  i suppose . they were family vacations . it was good and bad . lot of fun , but also annoying and agitating . you know how it is with family . you love each other and you drive each other crazy .  newline newline  i see ,  she said .  that s interesting . and i was there ?  newline newline  i swear . or it s all just the damnedest case of deja vu ever . kinda weird , right ?  newline newline  i suppose it is ,  she said , taking a slow sip of her martini .  but it sounds interesting .  newline newline  yeah ,  i said , draining my glass and suddenly feeling very selfconscious . she was a beautiful woman , after all , and i only then realized how weird i was being .  the brain s a strange thing .  newline newline  i meant your vacations ,  she said .  do you still go on vacations with your family ?  newline newline i snorted .  uh , no . we sorta aged out of that . and uh , my mom died a couple years ago , so ... you know , she was the one who pulled it all together .  newline newline  would you show me ?  said via .  i think it s something i d like to see .  newline newline  show you ... what ?  i asked . newline newline  these vacations ,  said via .  when i was there . where you remember me . could we see them ?  newline newline  i do nt understand ,  i said . i considered the possibility that she was mocking me . it can be hard to tell sometimes with foreigners .  you want to look at pictures or something ? i do nt have any family vacation photos with me , but i guess ...  newline newline via stood up off her barstool .  no . where i ve already been . i want to see what i m meant to see . show me .  newline newline she took my hands . she was much stronger than she d seemed . we walked out of the bar together . candice smiled and waved from a dark corner , cradling a beer in one hand and what looked like an art student in the other . i let via lead me away , though i was scared . she was strange . and i was strange . and i had no idea what we were about to do . newline newline out in the warm august night , she pulled me into a secluded spot just off the parking lot and held my shoulders in her hands . newline newline  where was i first ? the first time you saw me ?  newline newline i blinked .  disney world . but i really ... that might be my mind playing tricks .  newline newline via shook her head .  it s not a trick . it s something we should see . close you eyes and think about it . that moment . that place . that time . think and see . do you see ? is it there ? good , good ! open your eyes .  newline newline i did as i was told . and we were there . in disney world . in 1989 . everything was neon and plastic and fanny packs as far as the eye could see . newline newline and there we were . my family . my father and mother , yelling and jabbing fingers at a paper map . bobby , halfcomatose and sticky with churro . kelsie , whining at no one in particular , pointing at a lumbering , giant squirrelman three blocks away . and me  staring back at me . no , not me . i was looking at via . the beautiful woman in the blue dress who d come out of nowhere . the blue dress with the crescent moon made of a clear stones . the beautiful woman with green eyes . newline newline my father started walking away . my mother reached back and grabbed the younger me by the strap of my green tank top . so i turned and marched away , next to bobby and kelsie . newline newline  it s an interesting place ,  said via , watching as me and my family disappeared into the swarming crowd .  you had fun here ?  newline newline i nodded , dazed .  kelsie threw up on thunder mountain . it was great .  newline newline  thank you for sharing ,  said via .  where else did you see me ?  newline newline i did nt understand it . i still do nt . but what happened happened . we traveled . all the places via had been , via went . i witnessed history making itself . and i remembered  remembered the man who was always nearby the woman in the blue dress , always looking perplexed and lost . i remembered how unremarkable that man was in comparison to the woman in the blue dress . and i could see the young me learning to unsee the older me . i only had eyes for via back then . newline newline  why did you do this ?  i asked via , as we stood in wicklow , watching my family escape the rain by dashing into a pub . newline newline  because i had done it ,  she said , taking my hand and pressing it to her face .  you ve seen my relationship with time . it s a bit tenuous . and now ... i go where i ve gone , in the hopes that being where i ve been will tell me what i knew or show me what i ve seen . i ve been to that bar . i ve met you . i ve followed you backwards through time . i ve seen you age . and i ve seen you age further . i ve seen you through your end . so i ll do that again . to see what i ve seen and learn what i ve learned .  newline newline she pulled the glasses off my face , wiping away the raindrops with the hem of her dress . newline newline  i love you ,  she said .  not yet . but somewhere in all this , i love you . and you love me . i just do nt know when . and i ve forgotten how . and i ca nt see why . but i will . and you will . until then , i ll just keep traveling . okay ?  newline newline i said ,  okay ,  but it was nt . because i did love her , even if i did nt quite know why or how . it was as if i had been waiting all my life , so very , very patiently for her to show up at that bar . and then she did . and we traveled . i knew all too well how much i loved her . newline newline but she did not come back with me from ireland in 2009 . i do nt know where she went . i just know that she is retracing her steps , hoping to find answers . newline newline the trouble , of course , is that if she did come back to me , i would be no help . i do nt have any answers . why does she love me ? i do nt know . i ca nt even adequately explain why i love her . i do because i feel i m meant to  as if my love is the final machination of some monstrously complex , decades long rube goldberg device . newline newline so i wait . i hope she finds her answers . i hope she comes back to me . newline newline and every day i look , look for my lady in a blue dress .i used to have these vivid dreams on the nights that i actually slept . they seemed so real back then , like a touch of hope amongst rampant insomnia . after a good night  s rest anything seemed possible . i had so many possibilities ahead of me . i remember waking up and feeling so happy to have to have as many doors open to me as i did . i worked hard to put those opportunities in front of me . i loved the feeling of pride in myself that i had gone through so much work to put them all there , standing in a great big circle . standing so far away , right in the middle of them my eyes ate up every inch of distance between myself and circle of doors without humility . newline newline newline newline i didn  t sleep much though and the doors seemed to open and close over time , and that frightened me . i would lay awake in the night wondering and thinking but desperate to shut my mind off . i couldn  t help it though . it was hard to tell if a door would be open by the time i reached it . or , if the door was open , would i still like the one i was choosing when i  d gotten a closer look ? why my mind picks the middle of the night to choose my fate i can never fully understand . newline newline newline i chose one in the end . it was a good one ... i guess . i  m not as happy as i thought i would be considering i  m more rested than i  ve been in years . it  s not that i can  t sleep . i just can  t dream anymore . newlineme and my mother once worked for a travelling circus . she usually handled the meals and i made sure the cages were all locked at the end of the night . it was nt much , but it was work . newline newline now the ringmaster had a very beautiful daughter . she , for some reason or another had taken a fancy to me , said she liked my smile . she and i spent a lot of my down time together . newline newline well , her father did not like this one bit , still not sure what he did nt like about me . but one night , just as i was finishing my work , he and two others cornered me in the back . the strong man held me down , and the knife thrower put his blade in my mouth and he did this . he gave me a smile that never went away . newline newline after that , she stayed away from me , told me i terrified her . it s kinda funny how she always liked my smile when it was nt always around . but now i see the bright side . now i m always smiling . newline newline maybe you should smile more too . so how does this work ? do i sign a paper saying you have my soul , i am going to hell..  my mind wanders but he cuts me off . newline newline  no , no nothing like that . you see i am not interested in getting more people to hell , i got enough coming in every day . but from time to time it s nice to have someone who will do whatever you say no questions asked . it will only be once .  newline newline i turn my eyes and look at him for the first time ,  that s it ? only once .  newline newline  i do nt need it any more than that . i can make this deal ten times a day if not more .  newline newline  what sort of task will it be .  he smiles , he knows he has me . newline newline  it could be anything , kill this man , buy a slice of pizza for me , kill yourself . really it s just for my entertainment .  newline newline i look at him with disgust as he smiles on . he must get that look a lot . newline newline  and if i refuse what you ask of me ?  i need to know , i need to understand . i need to know the risk even though i think i understand it . newline newline  she dies instantly , no time to even gasp . so is it worth it to you ?  newline newline i look at my daughter , not even a day old , lying , dying , in the incubator . newline newline  yes of course .  newline newline  good  snap . the monitor beeps , a nurse comes over and smiles . newline newline  her heartbeats back to normal , she will be just fine . newline newlinepoka cuddled on the bed beside me , meowing loudly . he wants attention , and siamese cats sure knows how to get them . we had one when we were kids , and i remember her meows echoing through the house at night . newline newline its almost 2am . i had stayed up late preparing a presentation for coca cola tomorrow regarding their new commercials for christmas . they have high standards when it comes to christmas commercials , and as such it has been a pain in the ass . newline newline my girlfriend of two years pulls my blanket away from me while poka cuddles up next to her instead . its going to be a long night . newline newline   newline newline man , i have got to learn to try and get more sleep . now i ca nt find a parking spot and the presentation is in 10 minutes ! seems like the only place left seems to be the handicapped spot . i ve never done it before , but then , i ve never been this late . and parking spots to be seen ! newline newline fuck it , i ll park it somewhere else during my lunch break . newline newline running to the elevator , i see it closing right before my eyes .  wait !  i shouted . too late . urggh , this day is starting out to be a big pain in the ass ! stairs it is . 5 floors . just think of it as morning exercise , i told myself . newline newline arriving at the meeting room , i see that our clients are already seated inside . for some reason everyone seems to be dressed casually today . hmm ... ..oh well , does nt matter . newline newline  good morning , gentlemen !  i greeted them as i walked in . i opened up my laptop and connected it to the projector .  sorry about this , i got stuck in traffic this morning . some cyclist got hit by a firetruck .  not true , but i watched enemy of the state last weekend and for some reason it came to mind as a good enough excuse . newline newline  now , christmas , the happiest day of the year for children all over the country . how will we convey that emotional connection with coca cola ?  their logo popped up on screen .  how do we associate coca cola with christmas ?  the clients look surprisingly confused . newline newline a timeline of coca cola s history with christmas comes up .  fortunately for us , coca cola already has a long history with christmas , dating back to the early 20th century . because of this , we just need to remind customers of coca cola s importance towards christmas .  they look even more confused now . newline newline someone tapped me on the shoulder . its rick .  hey , alan , can i talk to you outside for a moment ?  huh , i wondered what i did wrong .  will you excuse us for a minute guys ?  rick ushered me outside . newline newline  what the hell are you doing ?  he whispered angrily .  this is nt what you were told to do ! and why are you dressed like you re about to meet your inlaws ?  newline newline i m baffled . i m wrong ? what did i do ? i ve been working on this for weeks . and as far i know the company has always maintained a strict dress code . newline newline  i thought we were supposed to come up with a new marketing plan for coca cola for december ! i did all you told me to do !  newline newline rick genuinely looks annoyed now .  marketing plan ? coca cola ? alan , what , the , fuck , are you talking about ? you re really pissing me off this morning .  newline newline  did you reassign me to a new client ? because this agency has promised me this client for months now ! pete guaranteed me that i get coca cola !  newline newline he started to rub his forehead .  agency ? client ? alan , what exactly do you think we re doing here ?  newline newline ok , this is really annoying me and creeping me out at the same time . i just noticed around me how the whole office seems different and everyone seems to be on a casual dress code . did the agency got taken over by another agency overnight or something ? newline newline  rick , what s going on ?  newline newline  you were supposed to come up with a proposal for a new social media platform that the company is thinking on investing in .  newline newline what ? i do nt remember this at all . just then i notice rick s nametag . it says google . newline newline  ah , right . i think i remember what you re on about .  honestly , i do nt , but i have no idea how else i m going to get out of this .  let s do this .  we walked backed into the meeting room . newline newline i closed my laptop .  sorry about that , gentlemen . confused you for a different client .  they laughed .  right .  i sighed . newline newline  our new social media platform .  shit , what do i call it ? i am not at all well versed in this . newline newline  its going to be called google ... ..  i noticed a swiss flag on one of the client s briefcases .  ... .plus .  i carried you in my arms once .  she says softly .  do you remember ?  newline newline newline  yes mother , i remember .  he remembered everything , every line on her face that had grown with each passing day as his own skin stayed smooth , every time she had looked in the mirror and sighed at the travesties that old age had wreaked upon her . every son thinks his mother beautiful , but no words could sooth away the glances she gave herself . newline newline newline  i came up this hill with you .  newline newline newline  i know mother .  the shaking hands when she had learned that her son would never die , and the black that she had worn when her husband died . some would see eternal life as a gift , but his mother counted her years with deaths . the lines in her face grew deeper as she watched him with women . she knew he would outlive them all . she knew he would be alone in the end . newline newline newline five white trees crown the summit of a green hill . between them a river starts . newline newline newline  every mother hopes her son will live forever . i suppose you will now .  newline newline newline  i suppose i will mother .  she had carried herself straightbacked through humiliation . she had endured the second marriage so that her son might be educated . she had endured the kicks and the slaps and the words that bit deeper than any of them . she had grown to love her second husband and she had worn black when he died , too . newline newline newline the path is rocky and overgrown . it has not been trodden for many years , but his long legs help her aged ones over the stones and dips that block the way . newline newline newline  will you remember me when i am only dust ?  newline newline newline  i will remember you mother .  she brought him here when he was a child . it had been dawn and the light was rising across the city . the light had hit her and the lines were wiped from her face . she had smiled at him and they had shared cake together , perching on the rocks overlooking the whole world . newline newline newline  i feel like a queen up here .  she had laughed . newline newline newline  you are a queen , mother !  he had been a lot younger then . he had nt noticed the bruises on her arms then .  you re beautiful !  her answer was ripped away by the wind , but he remembered the shaking head . newline newline newline she trips now and he catches her . he swings her round and holds her on his back . old bones do nt weigh much after all . he continues up the hill . newline newline newline  you have to see it from the top .  he says .  one more time .  newline newline newline  i carried you in my arms once .  she says softly , as though already in a dream .  and now you are carrying me .  newline newline newline  you have to wait till we reach the top , mother . you have to wait till then .  the words catch in his throat . newline newline newline  will you remember  she sighs . newline newline newline she is dead when he reaches the summit . he places her by the river on the green hill . every line in her face is gone . she could be a young woman , waiting for the dawn so that her life could begin . he kisses her forehead . newline newline newline  i will remember .  newlinei walked into the bar loathing the rest of this grim night . it was nt because it had started raining and will probably for the rest of the night . it was nt because i could not talk to the beautiful woman making eyes at me from a booth in the corner . it was because i hated my job . i work for a large cooperation that has their fat and greedy fingers dipped into the lives of people unfortunate enough to cross them . newline newline they start off slow usually by blackmailing these doomed individuals into shutting down their local business or to drop a civil rights case against them . the smart ones will have left the state by then and changed their face and name , they know if they do nt then it will end rather unhappily . newline newline if their slaves are nt obedient enough then they call me to take care of the problem . that s why i m here at this bar that smells of depression and broken lives . the man is playing pool alone on the far side of the bar . he is wearing khaki pants and dress shirt with some buttons undone , his tie and jacket hung up on the rack . he looks like a normal business man , probably with a dad or a family . all of which are just irrelevant . newline newline  how s it goin pal , can i play you a game ?  i ask in my most genuine and friendly voice possible . newline newline the man looks up from his game and says  sssure buddy , if you buy me another drink !  he slurs as he downs what is probably not his first drink of the night . this will be easier than i thought . i go up to the bar and ask for a whiskey on the rocks , he is going to need it for later tonight . the drink comes and it s aroma fills my sense with alcohol . i grab a vial of the vital black and thick liquid from my coat pocket and put a drop into the drink . newline newline  get back here with my drink !  the drunken man yells . i walk over to him with a smile on my face almost as if i am too happy to give him this toxic drink . he slams it back and belches obnoxiously in my face , these people never learn how to dignify themselves . newline newline  you should probably go get some air outside , you do nt look to well  i tell him . newline newline  thatssss ... . uhh.. oodd ... .. ideeee ... ...  he splurts out as he passes out in my arms . i place the man in a chair and text my boss that it s time . newline newline i wait next to the man in bleak anticipation of what is to come . that innocent , drunk man probably does nt deserve it but it does nt matter . i do nt get a say in this and i need this job . i hear the door open and look over to see my boss stroll in . he was a fat man wearing a white trench coat and a black baseball cap . everyone knows who this man is and how dangerous things somehow happen when he is around . the bar empties and even the bartender escapes out the back without a care for the property . he walks over to me and grabs a chair to take a seat for the show . newline newline  get on with it then  he exclaims loudly . newline newline punch the passed out man in the face to wake him up . i wince from the pain i feel from the punch but i ve felt it so much it becomes a tickle at this point . the man wakes up and seems to sober up immediately because of the scene . newline newline  no no no , please . i can keep paying the money i swear , i have a daughter i need to take care of and it was her birthday this month ...  he tries to justify . my boss pulls a dagger from his coat pocket and hands it to me . i hold the weapon in my hand and recognize the still shiny and sharp edge . i blur the sounds out of the man whimpering and sobbing as i begin the job . newline newline a stab to the right thigh . newline newline the left thigh . newline newline the two shoulders . newline newline every stab i feel . it hurts badly . it always does , but it feels routine now . i hold back tears as i slice his throat . with that i fall to the ground almost sobbing in pain and feeling broken as i always do . my boss tells me he will clean this up and congratulates me on being a good little slave . i lay on the floor staring at the blood running down the chair and onto the floor towards me . remember what i said before about the smart ones leaving the state and changing their identity ? i wish i could say i was one of them .every person in the world receives a creature at the age of 18 . since time immemorial , scientists and philosophers have been aching to find the reason for this , to figure out where the creatures come from and how they reach us . the guardians , as they have come to be called , are bonded in life and death to their owner . the creatures share the personality , the mannerisms , some say the very soul of their owner . cults and pseudoreligions are almost a part of our daily lives at this point . whenever someone turns 18 , a relatively large fanfare abounds around them . my brother was a cheetah he is quick on his feet and witty , and uses this to avoid facing his troubles . my mother and father are both feline as well , my mother a lion and my father a tigress . it was expected that i would be feline , like the rest of my family , and they talked about it constantly  i m sure you ll have one of the great cats , my son !   your guardian cat will make us all proud !  newline newline this world is different than most . in most worlds , people discriminate on ability , on race , on intelligence but not here . here , people discriminate on guardian . their was an hierarchy of guardians established by idiotic philosophers in the 5th century . newline newline first comes the feline natural leader and the proudest of men . newline the second guardian is that of the canine strong , but foolish in nature . a follower to the end , a warrior in their ways . newline the third is the avian flight marks the sign of invention and ingenuity , unperturbed by the ways of the world . newline a rank below is the boar a merchant at heart , cold and unmoving swine . newline below them lay all the host of the world , lizards , animals , watergoers all they exist solely to serve those above . newline finally are the legends creatures that do not exist except in the fancy of the world . these are the names that shall be remembered in time immemorial . newline newline george washington , the british general turned selfimportant emperor of america was a griffin , alexander the terrible is remembered as a seaserpent , henry the glutton king an ogre . nobody wanted a legend they always died an ugly death . so that day , my 18th birthday , i hoped for nothing but a cat , pushing out my secret desire for change that every man holds dear to their heart . i walked out into the sun for the first time that day , as was tradition , and my guardian was to materialize in front of me . instead , my family heard a great roar . they froze , my mother s hand going to her waist , then remembering she left her gun at the station . my brother ran back inside , and my father watched silently . the great roar sounded once more , and in the distance we saw the impossible . we saw a dragon . it landed in front of me and we all stood in silence for a moment . i hesitantly held me hand out in front of me . my mother gasped , realizing what i had known from the moment i heard the roar . newline newline i am a legend . i am a dragon . and it was time for some change . newline newline  newline newline holy hell that was horrible . i lost my motivation halfway through but i forced myself to keep writing  .  anything i could ve done better , i suppose ? :  you may have one wish granted .  newline newline the creature s eyes stared into his soul , and his soul seemed to stare back . this monster could not intimidate him  it was bent to his will , and the price of its freedom was a single wish . newline newline  i want all my debts cleared .  newline newline the demon was confused , but it did not wish to contest . a simple wish was best . newline newline  how much do you owe ?  newline newline  you misunderstand .  the hooded man smiled .  my debts are not monetary .  newline newline the demon , black and twisted and horrifying as it was , a true being of shadow , was bound . it did not wish to play these games . it wished to know what to do , and to be left to do it . it bit its tongue . newline newline  what then , are your debts ?  newline newline the man lifted his staff and pushed it down , the base of it letting out a commanding clap against the cold stone floor .  i have a deal with the devil . you will be the one to break my end of the bargain .  newline newline the creature s face twisted and turned . it knew this was absurd . it knew it could nt do anything about this deal . but if it denied the request of the hooded man , it would be killed and flung into eternal torment . or worse  it would be bound into the human s servitude . and while a demon serves , its life becomes its owner s own . this man would be immortal . this man had worked it all out . newline newline  how do you expect me to clear your debt to the devil , little human ?  newline newline  the answer to that is beyond my expertise . to answer that question is your job .  newline newline  you do nt possibly expect me to  newline newline  i do !  newline newline he slammed the staff down again . each of its claps was a warning . for a moment , the man s rage seethed , and the demon was intimidated . somehow . it had never felt this way before . this was a demon s greatest shame . to be enslaved by a mortal . but this demon had one chance . the human was immortal for as long as it served him . he would not die of old age , but he could be killed . not by his own servant , but he could die . newline newline  i can not clear your debt alone ... master .  newline newline  i m sure . then we will walk through the pits of hell together and have my debts cleared . if you value your freedom , it will be done . i will be watching you very closely .  there was silence for a moment .  now open the gate .  newline newline on command , the demon slipped into its own shadow . the shadow morphed and became round , and then a hole opened up , expanding from the shadow s centre , opening a path to a staircase . the man began to walk down , his shoes tapping rhythmically against the stone steps . the sky around him was a deep purple , but further down it seemed to become orange and later red . newline newline the black demon s shadow slithered down the stairs after him , having come through itself through the portal . rising out of it , the creature reformed . as the pair got further down , the steps behind them began to crumble away . the man did not change his pace  they did so too slowly . newline newline at the bottom of this staircase was a great iron gate , guarded by a demonic behemoth . it was many times his size , with a thick orange hide and a great pair of horns . it was heavily armoured , flames pouring out from its gauntlets up his arms . it carried a massive axe , which it did not hesitate to bring down on the hooded figure . the slice cut him in two . newline newline but there was no blood . instead , shadow poured out from where the slice had been made . a similar slice down the middle appeared on the black demon simultaneously , and the shadows poured out the same . the shadows solidified , and both were healed . the black demon approached , growing in size . it stared the gatekeeper down , and laughed maliciously . it s voice became booming . newline newline  my pain is his pain . his pain is my pain . i am nihl  high inquisitor of the damned . i have a debt to clear . death could not be defeated . he simply couldnt be . death himself found himself a bit shocked at the situation as well . this little , feeble child had managed to break him . he d taken hundreds of millions of children , but this one he could nt seem to bring himself to take . she was nothing more than a sad , lonely girl named eva with nothing to live for . newline newline eva had never done a terrible thing in her short , 10 year life , but he found her severely ill and living in a cramped alley with no one to take care of her . death was nt even there to pick her up when he met her : he was taking her neighbor in the alley when he heard her shuffle behind him . she looked up at him with these sad , grey eyes and asked him why henry had to die . after shaking off the initial shock of her being able to see him and figuring out who henry was , he responded in his usual chilling , calm manner .  it was his time . he was old and sick .  eva just nodded like she understood , completely unshaken by his hollow , empty voice , but how could she possibly ? how could she not fear him , death , the one thing all men feared ? she was just a child pretending to understand what he , death , had been going through for the entirety of his existence . but as he looked into her eyes , he felt like maybe she really did understand . after he too henry , he ghosted off and did nt think another thought about the little girl for a long while . newline newline a few days passed and he found himself in the same town for another ill street bum . death went up to him , did his usual job , and was about to walk away when he saw her again peeking at him from around a corner . curiosity got the better of him and he wandered over to her , his hollow voice brushing past his lips .  why are nt you afraid of me ?  she just continued to stare at him with her huge , watery grey eyes for a moment before hugging his legs .  you seem lonely .  sunken eyes turned down to look at her and for a moment he felt something like a spark in his eternally empty chest . it faded just as suddenly as it had come and was replaced with his usually icy chill . a small child was managing to unravel him . newline newline months passed with him returning to take away more of the population of her town . once he found himself contemplating going there without having any reason to . he was saved from his decision when another death required him to be elsewhere . when he did have a reason to go there , though , he did speak with her . eva did most of the talking though , because he did nt want to scare her away and she was right : he was lonely . newline newline a week or so and hundreds of thousands of jobs later and death finds himself back in that city , but when he faces his client he ca nt bring himself to take her . he knew that her time was short when he had looked at her , as he could see all timelines in the eyes of people , but he had tried to ignore it . had he known about the cancer ? yes , but death had ignored it , thinking that he would have more time before he had to pick her up . death knew that he could save her , but he also knew what that would mean for him . i ll take her next time , he told himself . he returned to that area many times after that , telling himself the same thing each time . as she grew worse and worse , eva began to resemble himself more than any child should . her skin was pale from illness , her eyes sunken in and almost all life gone , but she acted as though nothing was wrong , anyway . newline newline one trip was all it took to break him completely . newline newline  i wanto stop hurting .  death knew he could just take her just like his job entailed , taking away her pain in the process , and continue on as he always had , but he could nt bring himself to do it . how a small child had managed to fill a void this heartless entity did nt even know he had he would never know , but all he knew was that he could nt bring himself to kill her nor could he see her continue to suffer . it was in that moment , seeing her so broken , that he broke himself . he was in no way the first bringer of death , and he knew he was nt to be the last . placing his deathly thin hand on her head , death gave up his eternity to let eva live . death did not fade away or wither , but his flesh began to fill out and a color came to him . air filled his newly formed lungs and death began to live . fears and emotions that he had never known filled him . a new death would be formed to take his place and when his time was near , he would be taken by the same being he once was , but for the time being this living death was content being with his reason to live . newline  newline  i apologize for the length of this . i got really into the prompt . it was the election day again . in a world where each lie meant a scar you knew who was going to be trustful . i saw tony monzana again . the last time i saw him in person was the last election day . our old prime minister was going for a second round . newline newline he was about to start his political speech , he looked casual . he looked pretty clean for an average person , not many scars anywhere , brown hair and glasses . the usual . newline newline just before he got to start the speech his doctor ran to him and asked something about a skin surgery . tony asked him back  what fucking skin surgery , i have never had a skin surgery  . newline he immeditially broke in half , which his doctors only replied to  sigh ...  politicians  . newlineit took six months until i was able to go outside again . my friends and family worried about me , but no one could figure out what to do . i spent my days sleeping , because i spent my nights crying in the darkness of my bedroom , alone . newline newline she left me . i d spent seven years giving my all to her . i did anything i could for her . i wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with this woman . no one had ever made me as happy as she had . maybe that s why it hurt so much when she was gone . maybe that s why i just could nt seem to get over her . i had sacrificed so much . i had given everything i had , and she d taken it all and left with it . newline newline finally , on a rainy evening , i came out of my room . i had lost thirty pounds . i was sporting a beard that had nt been there the last time anybody had seen me . we went out to a local sports bar . everybody had a few drinks , shared some jokes , told lies of their latest conquests . some of my friends even jumped into the subject of setting me up with a girl they knew would be perfect for me . i smiled , i laughed , i played along . as far as anybody could tell , things were starting to take a turn for the better . newline newline i spent the next few weeks burying myself in anything and everything i could to keep my mind occupied . hobbies , work , spending time with friends . anything that could let me try to forget the hurt . nothing seemed to be working , but i could nt just give up on the rest of my life because she was gone . i had to go on living . newline newline i saw it happening before even my closest friends did . i started to become more withdrawn . i still went out , but less frequently . i still joked with my friends , but i laughed a little less each time . food became bland . colors became pale . strangers became blurs . i could nt remember feeling anything for days . it was as if the mental and physical portions of my identity were there , but the emotional portion had been lost in a sea of regret and pain . newline newline then it all came unglued . newline newline that night was nt especially tumultuous . laundry had been folded . the dishwasher was running . there was a droning buzz from a movie i had seen six times on the television . the lights were on in the little apartment , but everything was washed in a gray shadow . everything seemed to be a reflection of the apparition of how things should be . newline newline something inside clicked , and all feeling was gone . newline newline i took one slow , deliberate step towards the closet in my bedroom . there s something in there i need . newline newline a second step . an image forms in my mind . it s a small blue case , with a lock on the handle . there s something important inside it . newline newline the third step . i reach into my left pocket , pulling out my keyring . there s a key here that will open that lock , and i need to get inside that case . newline newline fourth step . i m in my bedroom now . i see my bed , unmade . something odd strikes me : i always made my bed in the morning . had i known , somehow , that i would nt be needing it made any more ? newline newline fifth step . the closet door is shining like a beacon in a storm , burning bright in the washed out gray of everything else . i know salvation is in there , i know i want it . i m just not sure i deserve it . newline newline sixth step . the cool brass of the doorknob in my right hand feels like a crisp breeze on an autumn day . a tingle runs up my arm and down my spine . do i have the strength to open this door and take what i need ? newline newline seventh step . the key is in the lock . the lock is on the floor . the case is open . the dull gray barrel strikes an ironic chord within me . of course , why would this be different than anything else ? newline newline i stand there , the hard rubber grip in a hand i did nt know had moved . my thumb on a hammer i do nt remember pulling back . my right index finger on a trigger i do nt remember reaching for . newline newline i stand there , staring , straight into the answer to all my problems . newline newline i fall to my knees , and i begin to weep . the first emotion i ve felt in weeks suddenly flooding my body . newline newline relief . sweet , satisfying relief .it had been a year , a year of tears and  why why why  asked late at night , not understanding why the love and light of his life had been extinguished . he traced the years of her life , and her name while quietly whispering it .  charlene , it s been real hard babe . i do nt think i can stay here any longer . now do nt think i m going to do anything stupid , you know that s not how i am . but babe , like i said , it s time i see the world .  he gently placed the peonys on her grave , her favorite flower , touched his fingers to his lips in a kiss and planted the kiss on her grave marker . he stood , blinking back the tears that burned behind his eyes and swallowed hugely .  i ll be back my love ,  he said as he hitched his backpack and sleeping role to his back . newline he walked along the shoulder of the road for a few miles , lost in thought , then stuck out his thumb . cars passed , and some slowed , but none stopped . then an older woman in a beautifully restored model t pulled over .  come along ,  she called .  we ve many miles to travel , and not so much time .  newline charity was her name , and she was charitible indeed . she talked as she drove , and he listened , thrilled by the stories of her life .  i have 9 children , 30 , grandchildren , 58 , great grandchildren , and a set of twins , my first greatgreat grandbabies , due sometime in the next two weeks.  she loved talking about her family , and his heart yearned to start his own family . newline they drove 150 miles together , him mostly silent except to ask questions when it was appropriate . newline  i d take you further love , but i ve a car show to attend .  newline  thank you so much charity . my heart is lighter because i met you .  newline before she let him leave , she gave him the fiercest hug he d had since charlenes  funeral , and when she pulled away , he saw her eyes were shining with unshed tears .  be good dear boy . hang on .  newline he wandered around the carshow for perhaps and hour , then felt the pull to be going again . newline again he walked , and again his thumb went out . the next person to pick him up was a young lady on her way to college after springbreak .  hop in man !  she smiled widely at him , and the warmpth that flowed out made it impossible not to smile back .  hope you do nt mind my singing . it keeps me going !  he did nt , and she had a lovely voice .  i m claire . what s your name ?  newline  daniel .  newline  you been hitching long ?  newline he smiled again .  no , today is my first day .  newline  how long are you gon na hitch then ?  newline  i suppose until i need to get back home . i made a promise .  newline she nodded , then turned up the volume to an apparent favorite song .  what does nt kill you makes you stronger , stand a little taller  ... newline he felt the words wash over him , as if the singer had written them just for him . newline  good song ,  he commented . newline  it is . makes me feel strong when i feel weak . know what i mean ?  newline  i do .  newline she let him off at a mcdonalds , along with 10 dollars so he could eat .  be careful dude . safe journey !  newline  and to you claire . good luck with your studies !  newline she beamed brightly , and he beamed back at her . she just had that feelgood vibe about her . newline after dinner , he scouted out the area and found a camping spot . the next morning he was up early , still feeling the need to go , go , go . newline a middle aged man on his way to a business conference picked him up , and talked about his family , his job , and how he was planning something special for his 25th wedding anniversary .  my wife , she s gon na be blown away . she s always wanted to see alaska , so i figured why not go on a cruise . it s good to see different things , different people . i have a feeling she s gon na love it .  newline  i hope so too ,  said daniel . he stayed in the mans  car for the whole morning , enjoying the company of one who was happy . newline and finally , a week later , he decided to head home . he d learned that bad things happen , but you have to move on . maybe you never  get over  them , but eventually you have to heal , or the past will consume you .this is the story about how i died . i m afraid i am the original inventor of the time machine , not like the weirdo who stole my plans when i never returned to my original timeline . once again i seem to have fucked up . newline this all started a few weeks ago  when my good for nothing boyfriend dumped me . after graduating with a first in astrophysics at the age of 14 this was humiliating . 21 and my boyfriend for the past 3 years leaves without a word . so i did what any angry jealous ex does when she believes her previous partner is a lying evil prick , she builds a time machine to ultimately destroy him and whatever whore he ran off with . newline newline after a few weeks i calmed down a bit . i ultimately decided that killing them would not be worth the time or effort , nor the jail sentence , so i set my mind to broader horizons . dreams of nobel prizes fueled my work till the portalesque machine was finished . it was like a metallic gate way , smooth with doors that slid to each side when a date was confirmed on the panel . i obviously assumed that my primitive version would be kept on display so that when i stepped into the future , to see where my obvious genius would get me . newline newline swirling lights of blue passed around me and as i stepped into the sun light i could feel the dust in the air . this certainly was nt right . this was my house surly it must be a national monument to science ? ? ! as i looked around , dazed i heard yelling and shouting . some one was pulling me and grabbing my arms , i was so tired . i woke up in this prison cell . technology has massively advanced since my original timeline . apparently time travel is  not permitted  nowadays . i am to be put to death for a law i did nt even know existed while someone else takes the glory for inventing the machine i built . i suppose once i ve been topped you ll run after him ? people are always the same , looking for who ever seems most exciting . well i can tell you i wo nt be treated like some common criminal . i may have no legacy but i will be avenged by someone , somewhere . newline rachel newline newline 002i checked my stats ,  what ! ? 15 !  newline newline everyone in the office stared at me . even lucinda stood up in her cube to mockingly at me over the wall . newline newline i had spent the past few days trying to find one status , any status , to get some  likes  . newline newline first , i  d pulled out old baby pictures of me . when it netted me seven bucks  one each from my  one from my older sister and young brother  one from my girlfriend  one from an ex , which did not go over well current girlfriend  and one from tim , who gives me the creeps  i knew i  d have to find a better tactic . newline newline puppies got me nothing . the place had become a cesspool of puppy and cat pictures with humorous sayings that people referred to as the apupcalypse or acatmageddon , so it was next to impossible to get my late dog muffy noticed . that it was a male dog that got named muffy was apparently only noteworthy to myself . newline newline finally , i put some  what i thought were sexy , but from the comments were more apparently funny  pictures of myself . i figured if i  m going to whore myself out , why not go all out it . in it to win it ! newline newline when creepy tim was the only one who  liked  it i almost gave up . newline newline then a wave of  i  m going to kill myself if i don  t get a hundredthousand likes  started popping up all over . i would have totally tried it but 1  i m afraid of dying 2  i m pretty sure my obit would get more likes that my threat 3  did i mention i was afraid of dying ? newline newline then , last night , i had the most brilliant idea . rushing to my computer i booted up photo shop . drafting up a picture of a cat , dangling from a shower curtain , over a me as a baby in a bathtub , with the threat of a plugged in hair dryer about to tumble in killing us all i overlaid the words  pussys , babes , and blow til  ya got ta go.  newline newline i thought it was gold ! i had walked into the office and started drafting up my resignation letter , rehearsing my  go to hell  speech for lucinda , and was on cloud nine . i figured , i check in to see how my investment was doing and  newline newline 15 likes . newline newline  that  s it ! i  ve had it !  newline newline logging in , i posted my final facebook  what  s on your mind ?  newline newline typing furiously .  goodbye facebook . hello ello !  and then started googling ,  how do i delete my facebook account  . newline newline as i pulled up the procedure to start the withdrawl process , my phone started buzzin . newline newline it was katy , my girlfriend .  what  s up ?  i asked as i slid my phone between my ear and shoulder . newline newline  did you rob a bank or something ?  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  half a million dollars just showed up in your checking account !  newlinei read the paper in my self driving tesla on the way to work at wind farms international , and i realized that some countries were still burning oil for heat and locomotion .  last drops of oil burned today in mexico  the paper read . however , in almost every civilized country not being held back by sanctions  ahem , new korea  , we had made burning of nonrenewable resources illegal . solar power , fusion reactors , wind power , and some damn fine dams were all we used here in the netherlands . life went on as usual , but now instead of civil wars and genocides , i expected this winters papers to be filled with desperate cries from 4th world countries for wind turbines to heat their homes and not freeze to death . my christmas bonus was going to be amazing this year , we re about to get a bunch of orders . what the fuck is wrong with you , you fucking faggot !  the good looking guy in a crowd of his friends shoved aaron in the chest as they passed by him on the street . newline newline the wind was knocked from aaron s lungs as he stumbled back from the force of the blow . he quickly regained his footing and continued walking until he came to an alley that he could duck into for some privacy . when he reached the darkest corner of the alleyway , he bent forward to lean his hands on his knees and catch his breath . he reached up to the mask he wore and as he pulled it up to expose his face in the shadows , he grabbed his handkerchief out of his jacket pocket to wipe the sweat from his brow . damn , these masks got hot . he straightened back up and put everything back in its place . newline newline he left the alley to head home , getting many strange looks but thankfully that was all . when he was safely inside his house with the door locked he removed the mask and hung it on its specific hook , in between the raccoon mask with real fur and the dog mask with long whiskers . newline newline he stood looking at the mask he had just taken off , it was nt anything , just a sickly green color with black around the eyes and along some creases and cracks that had been manufactured in to it . it was one of his favorites . when he wore it he always liked to dress up , today he had chosen to wear a black suit with a black vest and tie and a royal purple long sleeve shirt . in his mind , he felt like he looked sharp wearing it . that was only in his mind , he had nt looked at himself in a mirror in over a decade , since the day he bought his first mask . his house was full of mirrors , twelve , to be exact , but they were all covered in expensive black leather . newline newline aaron sighed and looked around , then grabbed carelessly at a mask that looked like a field mouse . he put the mask on and pulled his shoulder length hair up under a black knit hat before heading out again . newline newline this time , when he ran into the asshole on the street , he would nt hesitate to show the little punk that he carried a knife . or that a benefit of wearing a mask is that no one knows what the fuck you look like .when they were found , the world rejoiced . it was confirmed  we are not alone in the universe . but what would come next , nobody could have predicted . ten weeks after the frozen eggs were extracted from a drifting asteroid in the kuiper belt , they hatched , in a lab controlled environment . they were relatively harmless in birth  tiny and fragile , with dull claws and strange oval shaped heads . scientists allowed them to grow to maturity under close observation , isolated in a chamber . our cameras recorded them twenty four seven . the first casualty came about three months after their birth , when the largest of the creatures somehow escaped the chamber . it left only a large hole where the wall had been , and went on a rampage within the facility . dr jonas ruthger , the mans name was . impaled by its sharp claws and torn to pieces , the man stood no chance . the response task force that entered the facility to contain the incident quickly found out that the creatures have the ability to manipulate magnetic fields , not unlike telekinesis . as they rained bullets on the large predator , it simply conjured an invisible wall , shielding itself . it took two hours before they restrained it using a grenade to knock it out  gas and bullets proved useless . newline newline a few months more and they had seemingly matured . the largest predator , dubbed apex , had begun displaying signs of leadership and extremely high intelligence . the creatures seemed to realize they were under observation , and at that point , it took them only thirty minutes to find and destroy every single camera . being in the dark , we immediately readied the response task force once more , armored to the teeth  but as they prepared to enter the chamber , the power grid went down , darkening the whole facility . it echoed when the doors opened , and for a minute it was completely quiet . the comms were turned off shortly after the screams began . after the fall of the facility , we lost track of them , but we never stopped searching . it took three full years for them to resurface , and they were greater in numbers , and power . much greater . we were driven off our own planet . our home . every single reclaimation effort failed , every single missile detonation futile . they seemed immune to radiation , gas , everything we threw at them . we were forced to evacuate to our mars colony , but the number of survivors were much greater than what the small , simple colony could handle . starvation slowly settled in , and conditions worsened each day . the youngest martians , who had been born on the planet itself , hated us . we d brought misery to their home . newline newline after a while , our whole electrical grid had been disabled and rewired , somehow . ninety percent of our sattelites went dark . but we manged to use a select few to pin point the aliens location from orbit , taking blurry pictures . and we saw what they had been doing in our abscence . small lights dotted the grand canyon , as well as large hives . they were building a capital , a base . and they were expanding , fast . newline newline we soon lost contact with the few humans we had left behind when we escaped . we soon lost contact with earth . newline newline oh dear ,  and a gloved hand poked the gaudy greenandwhite bloodstained costume . newline newline  we ca nt let them scare us !  the red ranger gestured and posed with alarming swiftness ,  we ll always stick together !  newline newline the yellow ranger shook a hand toward the bloody , bullet riddled , green ranger that hung from the tree . a cardboard sign emblazoned with ,  east side ,  was strapped to his chest . newline newline  bubut , they kikilled  she shook with her sobs . newline newline  we ca nt let them intimidate us !  and the white ranger posed ,  go megazor  newline

february 29th , 2264 . newline newline i was an accident . newline newline there s no arguing that because no one was supposed to be born on the colony ship . the only people out of stasis were the crew and ... well my parents were on watch and they broke a few rules . newline newline today is my birthday . 16 . or 4 . everyone likes to joke about that . newline newline i do nt know who will read this , maybe it s just mom and dad or maybe it s going to be some historical record . i guess i m kind of special . newline newline the boy born in space . newline newline the boy who died in space . newline newline they talk about that a lot . stasis wo nt work on me because of the physiological differences of being born in a zero gravity environment . it would crush me . so they say . i wo nt live long enough to see our new home either . newline newline so ... newline newline yeah . that s fun . newline newline they gave me lots of books though . that was my birthday present . access to the library . space is nt all that bad . sure it s dark and endless but it s got a surreal beauty to it . i do nt mind . newline newline it just gets a little quiet is all . they decided since i ca nt sleep they d spread the watches out . so i get four years alone for every six months with the crew now . newline newline so ... yeah . also fun . newline newline tonight i m going to read animal

these four legged things with fur that hunt and survive and roam in the forests and water . newline newline trees ! they re so beautiful , stretching up to clear blue skies and soaking up the sunlight . i ve never seen anything like that . i wish i could see something like that . newline newline and water ! of course there s water on the colony ship but there s these huge amounts of it all over earth ! so much of it , as far as you could see and then further . newline newline of course you know about these things . i wonder if there will be anything like that at the colony . newline newline

reaching for the sky , steel and glass . there s plenty of steel and glass around here but it s not the same . newline newline it also showed the smoke . the darkening sky . streets filled with garbage and bodies . newline newline apparently there was some sort of event , food shortages and riots and water wars . newline newline i do nt like that . newline newline what did we do to the blue sky ? newline newline magic could nt stop madness . so for all their might and power they sat ashen faced and helpless as the massive door slid closed burying them alive beneath a mile of rock and earth . weeping as the world ended above them in a torrent of fire and destruction . the professors stayed close to their students , arms outstretched surrounding them like hens around their chicks . shielding them in a sense from the horrors which assailed them . headmaster brambledom needed them all close together as well . so he only had the cast the spell once . he nodded solemnly to each of them while he stood in the gloom . it was approval . it was farewell . it was a thanks . he commanded the last words the professors would ever hear and the group was encased in a bubble of coalescing energy . frozen in time until he released them . provided the damn muggles and their technology did nt manage to somehow kill him despite his planning and precautions . which it just might . he had only a vague understanding of radiation but he knew enough to fear it . the world belonged to that lethal wraith . for now . newline newline however he knew it would lose its power over time . so he would pit his patience and sanity against it . he smiled . he knew who would win that fight . he walked down the halls to his modest quarters . there was all the food and entertainment in the world stocked down here . for one man . because there had nt been much time and he did nt want generations to pass locked below the ground like worms trapped in mud . dreaming of the sun and moon and stars . he wanted people who remembered the world so that they would have a chance to make it again . make it right . the muggles had a shot at it . their attempt raged above as a radiation saturated inferno . the new world would be different . a world of magic and respect for life and a fear of unchecked power . nuclear weapons . bioterrorism . they would know enough to know better . he smiled and slumped down exhausted into his ancient red felt chair . had nt that muggle genius said that world war four would be fought with sticks ? he had no idea brambledom thought and fell asleep without meaning to in the flickering candlelight . newline newline it would be a lie to say that the time passed easily or quickly for it did neither . but brambledom was a master and one of the finest wizards who had ever lived . he was patient and he was strong . every year he sent out an owl with a geiger counter to see how it was and every year the owl never returned . so he waited . he played games with his golems . he argued with the goblins when they came over for tea . he watched his father s phoenix make and unmake itself over and over again . decades passed . generations passed . he grew old but slowly . he looked forward to the owl every year and every year he waited for hours by the chute hoping for something and nothing ever came . until one day it did . the owl returned and the radiation was minimal . it came back hale and strong . he watched it for a month and when it seemed to fine he knew it was time . he pulled the runes of unmaking he said the words that he had waited his whole life to say . his throat was dry and it took him three tries to finally recite the incantation . he disappeared the skeletons of his dead friends and waited for the kids and teenagers to awaken . they had powered the spell with themselves . he could have never done it without them . newline newline it was a short speech but he thought it was his best . he had practiced and refined it for decades so it was about as perfect as it could be . it told them they were the future . they had survived the end of the world . but now they needed to go and remake it . he explained the passage of time and how fire had rained from the skies but that they had a chance to go and make it right . they needed to stick together and trust each other and most of all they had a responsibility to use their power for right and not for evil . to show the world that magic could be trusted because they might be the only practitioners left in the entire world . they had a chance to work with and unite with the survivors of earth . it was his finest lesson and after it was done and all the questions were over with he opened the vault door and guided his crying and bewildered students outside the door . as they left he shook each ones hand . when the last one was through he sealed the door back up behind them . he still heard weak pounding up to two days later but he had expected that . he knew his friends would have expected him to go with them . to guide them and accompany them into the new world but it was nt his world . it was theirs . besides he thought with a smile he could never leave his friends behind . he would join them in the darkness where they could all finally have peace . alan , how long is this going to keep up ?  a thirtyish woman with dark hair in a tight knot on the top of her head said from a sofa . newline newline  i i don  t know ,  an annoyed man said from a worn plush chair . the hair in the top of his head laid like a sweaty mop . he had just caught his breath .  you know as well as i do.  newline newline  everything  s taken care of outside ?  newline newline  i  m fairly certain . i rushed as fast i could to get everything where it needed to be.  newline newline  mhmm ,  the young woman said . the two sat racking their brains for something they  d forgotten and left out for the dust storm . whistling wind and pelting debris stood in for silence in the small , shabby dwelling . the young woman concluded her mental inventory and stood up . she made her way over to a pot of boiling water on a stove . newline newline  i  m not very hungry ,  the man said to his wife off behind him in his chair . newline newline  you ought to be ,  she responded and went from the pot to a table . newline newline  i  m too upset to be hungry.  newline newline  don  t be . you can  t do anything about this.  newline newline  it doesn  t make me any less upset knowing i can  t do a damn thing to fix this situation i  m so upset about.  newline newline  well enough ,  she said in a sighing manner and began cutting carrots into little discs . the thunking contact of the knife on the hard wooden table now accompanied the whistling and pelting that replaced silence in the house . newline newline  god damn it ,  alan looked up from the fray of thread sticking out of the button on his shirt that he was twiddling .  anne ,  he paused for a moment and clenched his jaw hoping his wife would have something to say . he needed time to think of how he should word what he had to share with his wife .  you  re going to get very upset with me.  he swallowed painfully and focused back on twiddling the fray of thread .  first , i want to say i  m sorry , and it was a mistake.  newline newline the thunking of the knife on the table stopped . the whistling and pelting persisted . newline newline  i forgot about the dog ,  alan confessed .  ii don  t know . i was busy with everything else . it slipped my mind  he figured he said all he could say that would be any use minimizing the hell to pay . newline newline  it  s just a dog.  newline newline alan was terrified . he knew anne loved the dog . she picked it out when it was a puppy . seven years they had had the dog . they took the dog off alan  s parent  s neighbor  s hands just before alan and anne moved to oklahoma . newline newline  i forgot too , alan . don  t beat yourself up too much.  newline newline a crash thundered at the door . alan rocketed up from his chair and froze , eyes locked with anne  s . another crash at the door . someone or something trying to barge its way in . newline newline  hold on !  alan yelled to the door .  let me let you in !  newline newline the crashes at the door were thunderous . their dog chester , a seventy pound german shepherd , was far from capable of such force . both alan and anne knew it was a physical impossibility for the clamor at the door to be chester , but they very dearly believed it most certainly had to be their beautiful black and brown dog . newline newline alan unlocked and swung the door open and the whistling intensified and the pelting infiltrated into the interior of the home . a tall , wiry man stumbled in and yanked the door shut , the handle still in alan  s hand . the wiry man dropped a sack from his shoulder to the ground . newline newline  thank you !  he yelled hoarsely and gasped in a breath ,  thank you !  he took a seat on the floor and caught his breath . his clothes and hair were saturated with dust . newline newline  are you okay ?  alan asked standing over the man . newline newline  i  m fine ,  the man said with his eyes closed as his breathing steadied .  holy hell.  newline newline  can i get you anything ?  anne asked and approached . newline newline  some water please ,  the man requested and anne stopped approaching and spun around . newline newline  i might as well tell you now and get this out of the way ,  the man on the floor started .  this bag here is filled with money . this was bound to come up and i apologize for putting this on you guys but you  ve just happened to have saved my life . i don  t know what kinda folks you are  he paused to catch his breath that was still steadying . newline newline anne handed him some water and he took a large , clumsy gulp .  i don  t intend to let you know where the money came from , and i  m sure you don  t wan na know.  he paused to meet the glares of the two standing over him .  but i  m gon na give you some of it whether you want it or not and i  m gon na be gone once i can get back outside.  newline newline whistling and pelting stood heavily over the air in the room .  i suppose you  ll want some soup ,  anne started .  i  m making soup . alan get this man some of your clothes and help him get ready for supper.  alan gave the man a hand up to his feet . newline newline the door handle twisted and the unlocked door swung back open . the wiry man quickly got to his knees and fumbled with one of his arms in the bag on the floor . a fat man with a sheriff s star on his breast stumbled in . the wiry man pulled his arm out of the bag . the arm came out with a pistol clenched at the end of it . the pistol pointed at the sheriff s chest and put two bullets in it . next , the pistol pointed at alan s chest . the man pulled the trigger twice but no bullets came out . newline newline alan dove on top of the man as the man shoved his arm into the bag again . anne seized a meat cleaver from a drawer and sprinted over . the wiry man grappled his way on top of alan and sat on his chest with his hands around alan s throat . alan clamped his hands around the man s throat in response . the two grunted and spat , eyes locked in mad fury . newline newline anne came down with a mighty blow from behind into the man s back . just off to the right of the man s spine , the cleaver stuck in . the man rolled off to his side . alan remained on the floor sharing a moment of bewilderment with anne . anne shut the door and the intensity of the whistling and pelting diminished but still remained in place of silence . newline our anniversary is nt today . we had our wedding in june , remember ?  i smirked at her .   this time it was you who forgot when our anniversary was ! now i have an excuse for the next time i forget !   i thought . newline newline  no , i m talking about our first meeting anniversary !  i rolled my eyes . our meeting anniversary ? did couples really celebrate things like that ? newline newline i grabbed my lovely but sometimes sappy wife s hand .  of course i did nt forgot ! follow me .  i led her out to our backyard . newline newline  where did i bury that thing ?  i wondered . newline newline  why is my present underground ?  newline newline i ignored her and retrieved a spade . i began digging , uprooting the flowers she had planted there . i knew she was nt going to be happy with me , but some sacrifices had to be made . i continued digging until i uncovered a shoe box . i opened it , and inside was a number of memorabilia from my youth , such as old toys and books . i decided to reminisce later , as i had an angry wife to deal with first . newline newline  this is a journal i kept in high school .  i opened the journal and read her an entry . newline newline  a new girl came to our school today , and holy hell is she hot . she was wearing this ...  i skipped over that part .  we talked a bit . man , she s so smart and beautiful and amazing that i feel blessed she decided to talk to me .  newline newline i looked up and gave my wife a smile . newline newline  and i still do . oh god ... it s all so clear now . how could i not have seen it before ? the evidence was staring me straight in the face . the companies flaunt the evil practices they do behind closed doors . their dark secrets open to the public , disguised as slogans and mottos . newline newline mcdonald s  i m loving it ,  crap ? yeah they do love it . love injecting the food with lard and giving people heart attacks . gives them a thrill when the heart attack statistics go up . newline newline nationwide on your side ? your god damn right . they plant chips into your sides to track what you do . newline newline like a good neighbor statefarm is there ? that s cause they are always there . tracking your movements . stalking you . newline newline subway s  eat fresh ,  could nt be bad , could it ? wrong . you wan na know why it s fresh ? they keep human prisoners in the basement . that s right . they re serving people . whenever they run out of meat they go into the basement and kill another . newline newline do nt  trust the midas touch .  they re a bunch of molesters . newline newline and do nt get me started on oreo s  double stuffed  cookies . those bastards are monsters . newline newline keep an eye out the next time you see a slogan . they re catchy , and more true than one might think . dark secrets open to the public . i could say more , but i think they re catching onto me ... spread the word . they have to be stopped !yeah , i m a genie . not a good genie , but i m a genie . newline newline you want her to love you again ? yeah , i can do it . you wo nt like it , but i can do it . see you ve got two possibilities . either you love her , or you do nt . if you do nt love her , it s pretty simple . you ll have your fun , sure , for a while . but wishes , see , wishes do nt just go away when they re no longer convenient for you . so what do you think will happen when you want to leave , and she does nt ? you think you ll be able to just walk away ? think again . she ll still be pursuing you long after you ve finished with her . for the rest of her life , actually . newline newline but you actually love her , do nt you ? you know , that s actually worse . see , forcing somebody to love you is kind of an asshole move . you re stoping all over her right to decide for herself . she ll think she loves you , but it ll be the wish talking . she ll think she wants you , but it s just the magic . it might as well be rape . do you really think you ll be able to live with yourself knowing that every scrap of love she feels for you is forced ? is fake ? newline newline do nt get me wrong , i ll still do it . like i said , i m not a good genie .it was a long walk from the black van i rode in down the long concrete corridor into some underground compound . i knew i was underground because it smelled dank and damp , like the basement of a weho bathhouse . newline newline some cute airman who could nt have graduated basic training more than a few months ago opened doors for me by sliding his card in several slots . i wondered about his card , wondered if he d pass my checkpoints . newline newline finally , i was taken to a room with a long conference table where four other guys were already sitting with folders in front stuffed with various documents . i found the last empty chair at the table and as i sat down , some daddy general burst into the room . newline newline  gentleman !  he grunted . at his bark , i wanted to stand at attention . the young hispanic boi at the far end of the table rose slightly , but sat back down quickly enough .  in front of you are top secret documents for your eyes only . you may not repeat anything you see or hear in this room , at penalty of death .  newline newline i had heard this speech before , remembering all of the times i ve been dragged out of my apartment in the castro at five in the morning ... well , for government work , that is . official government work . newline newline  open your dossiers ...  general daddy grunted ,  ... and inside ... you ll find ... your next assignment .  newline newline the documents included photos of obama in mom jeans , talking into a flipphone , hanging bob marley posters in the oval office , and closeups of his unibrow . there were several sheets of correspondence , some addressed to his flotus from the nsa , others from hilrod and nate berkus . also included was an invoice showing orders of protein bars , boxed wine , and iceberg lettuce shipped to the white house with the signature of the president s chief of staff . newline newline  as you can see , vice president biden has exhausted his resources , save from dressing and feeding potus personally .  the general sighed .  your president and your country needs you ... now .  newline newline as each of us glanced with terror through each leaf , we realized what was at stake . despite the arduous task ahead , each of us knew exactly what we had to do . though obama has eight years , this would be our finest hour . indeed , we knew it would be a tough job , but with ted s gastronomy , kyan s aesthetic , thom s knack for design , and jai s cunning , i was certain we had what it took to win the culture war for america . for christ s sake , matthews , get in here !  my boss bellows from his office , sticking his head out long enough to give me an unbecoming glare before retreating again . newline newline i scurry over , my phone to my ear , explaining my situation to him over the hollow ringing and repeated introductions to  leave a message for clara after the beep !  newline newline  sir , i ca nt , i have to call my daughter , i need to speak with her !  newline newline my desperate please are punctuated by a loud crash that shakes the whole earth . the end is near . newline newline  matthews , i do nt care if you re calling your grandmother , you re in my charge and you do as i say !  is all i get as a reply . i shoot another text to clara and focus on the task at hand . newline newline mr. gordon is haphazardly shoving fistfuls of papers into briefcases and cursing the  scumbag foreigners  under his breath . far from laughing at the irony and inaccuracy of his frustration , i begin to develop a headache at his stupidity . newline newline  matthews ! i fired tyler , you ll need to finish his assignment .  newline newline i stand in shock for a moment before replying . newline newline  sir , it s the apocalypse . whatever his assignment was , i m sure it can wait !  newline newline  not this time , matthews . here are the specs .  newline newline mr. gordon trots away down the hallway , surprisingly quickly for someone so large . i look down and read the sheet of paper he has just thrust into my hands . newline newline  the committee for the revival of humanity presents : how and why to rebuild civilization .  newline newline below were long paragraphs explaining the importance of writing clearly , of describing fully , and so on and so on . newline newline i had known tyler had been working on preparations for the apocalypse , but i did nt know it was this . newline newline as much as i wanted to rush home to my daughter , i knew i could nt  not least because her mother would nt let her near me  . i seated myself at mr. gordon s desk and followed the instructions to log into terrabite , the program that would allow me to submit the assignment so that it could be accessed in hundreds of bunkers worldwide , should anyone survive in one and need it . newline newline the blank screen in front of me was daunting , and i let my mind wander , though i had been trained for this moment for nearly a decade . newline newline first i thought of mr. gordon . what an idiot ! not only did he have no respect for individuals , but he had fired tyler , who was one of three people on the planet suited to write this report . also , there s no need to screech at and order around the few people left with you at the end of the world . i was sorry that he was likely the last person i d ever speak to . newline newline but he did nt have to be . newline newline i pulled out my phone again and called clara . clara lynne , my sweet teenage daughter . what a gem in a world of stones ! newline newline my face lit up when she answered , though she was whispering and her voice sounded strained . newline newline  daddy ! listen , i do nt have much time  newline newline i did nt cut her off , because i wanted so badly to hear her voice , but her mother did . i heard the banshee shrieking through the phone . newline newline  you idiot girl , is that your father ? useless lump does nt need to hear from you , now come on , pete needs a drink and my nails are wet !  newline newline  it was typical of her to ignore reality in exchange for a more pleasant situation  . newline newline i heard clara pleading , and then her voice got louder again as she turned back to her phone , her mother still yelling in the background . newline newline  daddy , i have to go , i lo  newline newline click newline newline i heard the dial tone . newline newline i knew that calling her again was useless , but i sent her a text to tell her i love her and stared again at the screen in front of me . newline newline i knew exactly what i should be doing copying and pasting endless paragraphs about safe sex and healthy pregnancies and how to avoid diseases and everything we know about stable infrastructures . i should be writing in good governmental methods and encouraging the readers to send out radio signals to ensure that they gather everyone safely into one area . newline newline instead , i think of mr. gordon , whose lack of compassion and irreverence for the human spirit has made my life hell for far too long . newline newline i think of my exwife , the witch who would keep me from my daughter in the world s final hours . newline newline i think of clara lynne , a goddess on this earth , trapped for far too many years in the house of her deadbeat , abusive stepfather and ordered around by her mother . newline newline and i could nt do it . newline newline i could nt encourage people to rebuild a society that would end up tearing itself apart . i could nt support the reestablishment of something that crushed so many beautiful spirits . newline newline finally , i touched the keys in front of me . newline newline  how to rebuild civilization : do nt .  newline newline send newline newline i leaned back in my chair , took a deep breath , looked at the picture of clara that graced my phone s lock screen , and waited for the end . newline are you kidding me ?  yelled gordon ramsay .  you little lazy piece of   newline newline  gordon , telephone ,  chirped gordon s secretary . newline newline gordon closed his book and picked up his stress relief ball . newline newline  hello ?  newline newline  this is gordon .  newline newline  we were wondering if you could fly out to iowa for a show ?  newline newline  iowa ? !  gordon yelled in his head .  iowa ? ! ? ! ! ! ?  newline newline  ok ,  said gordon . newline newline   newline newline gordon got on his private jet and began cooking a five star meal . everyone loved it . however , he seemed a little off . newline newline  are you ok , mr . ramsay ?  asked his pilot . newline newline  well , i have a little headache ,  replied gordon .  i m sure i ll feel normal soon .  newline newline  of course , sir ,  said his pilot , taking the hint . newline newline as soon as gordon had sat back down , the pilot disengaged the plane s autopilot and played space invaders with the joystick . newline newline  what the actual fuck is wrong with you ?  bellowed gordon .  did you just learn to fly a plane yesterday you glorified flight attendant ? !  newline newline  ah , i m feeling much better ,  gordon whispered to the pilot .  keep it up .  newline newline   newline newline when the plane landed , gordon suavely talked his way into a free cab , a free hotel room , and another free worldclass dinner at a top tier restaurant . while eating , he was struck by creative genius and invented a signature dish while optimizing the restaurant by 300  . newline newline unfortunately , he felt that he was coming down with a slight cold . newline newline  excuse me ,  he politely asked the head chef ,  could you please chop this onion a millimeter too large ?  newline newline  certainly , mr. ramsay ,  responded the chef . newline newline  what are you doing you son of a bitch ? !  exploded gordon .  no , that s not right . you re more of a daughter . let a real man chop your onions .  newline newline the onions cleared gordon s sinuses while his anger helped his immune system recover from the long , quiet cab ride . newline newline   newline newline on set , gordon helped the novice chefs improve their cooking tremendously . he even took the stupidest one aside for a minute , and returned him a culinary savant . newline newline while demonstrating his chopping technique , gordon felt a muscle in his finger stretch a little too much . newline newline  would you be so kind as to hand me that pot ?  he asked one of his pupils . newline newline  of course !  said the cheery youngster . newline newline  are you serious ? are you actually serious ?  gordon screamed .  you just handed me that pot with two hands . one hand . you got that ? one hand so that your other hand can always be chopping . do you fucking understand ?  newline newline  bbut  newline newline gordon smashed his fist into the cutting board twice and hurled the pot at the wall . newline newline  you will address me as gordon ramsay sir or so help me god i will fillet you with a butter knife .  newline newline gordon smashed his fist into another pot until it  the pot  had a hole in it . newline newline his hand felt much better . newline newline  thank you for opening your restaurant to me ,  gordon said sweetly .  if you ever need anything , give me a call !  newline newline   newline newline rtranslationlostin newline newlineone second jamie was enjoying the comforts of heaven , sipping on a divine mug of hot chocolate which was as smooth and airy as the clouds he was sitting on . the next , he was jerked back down into a void . slowly , details began to clear up , shapes became more visible . newline newline he was back on earth . in a hospital more precisely . there lying on the bed was a young man . unconscious , with huge stitches on his torso . jamie was surprised to find himself there , but soon floated along until he got closer to the bedside . there were notes , doctors notes . he tried to pick then up , but found himself unable to . on the front page however it was clear to see that the man had just received a transplant . a liver transplant from a mr. j woodman . newline newline jamie woodman . he had never expected this when he had filled out the donor card application . did every dead person who donated an organ get to see this ? he began smiling , it was truly the best he had

did nt seem to notice him , if they did they did nt care . they looked fairly human in structure , outlines of facial features easily visible . what disturbed him was the dark red gap they all seemed to have , exactly where there liver should be . newline newline the looks on their faces . they seemed hungry , as if waiting to rush in and eat the man . as if reading his thoughts , one of the figures rushed towards him and jamie found himself firing a small bolt of electricity in the creatures direction . it howled , thrashing about on the floor . he jumped on top of it , grabbing it by the neck . newline newline  what are you ?  newline newline  just let me have him . please i want to be whole , i lost mine , i was weak ,  the creature muttered . newline newline  have him for what ?  newline newline  his liver . i donated mine , and my donor had his stolen . stolen by them .  newline newline  them ?  jamie asked , curious as to what was happening . newline newline  the shadows . the silver shadows took his liver , and now i need to find a new one . please let me have him .  newline newline  you just told me what would happen if i gave you him . you re not very smart are you ?  he asked , laughing a little despite the situation . newline newline  please .  newline newline  nope , in fact here have this ,  he said , shanklin the shadow with iron restraints that he made appear from thin air . newline newline the other shadows backed away , clearly scared of sharing the same fate . the hungry look in their eyes was still present , but jamie understood now . this was a battle for his humanity , one he could nt afford to lose . newline newline that was five years ago . every day since then , jamie watched the man day and night , fighting off any shadows that tried to approach him . eventually they got the idea that he was nt to be messed with , and they gave up for the most part . jamie kept on his toes , he did nt know exactly how this had happened or why , but

day . he was enjoying iced tea with his family when he heard the voice in his head and saw the figure in the shadows .  three wishes . fame . fortune . it  s yoursjust say the words  he thought about it . he was already ceo of one of the top companies in the west . he had the fame , he had the fortune . there was nothing else he needed . but what else did he want ? newline newline when elaine showed him the two blue lines on the stick , they were stunned . after their first child , they were told that the baby barely lived and she could have no more children . they considered abortion but quickly decided that it was a blessing in disguise . the night before the baby was due , peter added an extra prayer :  i wish for my child to be protected from any harm  . it was the most beautiful baby to have ever been born in that hospital . jack grew up to be big and strong . he had a lot of friends growing up , friends who respected him and would fight for him . when jack grew up , he made his friends get lots of cars , guns , and money . jack was unstoppable . elaine cut off the newspaper and cable to avoid reading about how her son ran the biggest crime syndicate in the city and that the crime wave was spreading throughout the states and even beyond . no one could touch her son . newline newline after peter  s son had his friends go on two murderous rampages , the board of directors felt that peter  s family life didn  t represent the company very well , so they let him go . he wasn  t too concerned  they had a comfortable amount of money to live off of well past retirement . they had to live quiet lives though . elaine was withdrawn from him and from life in general . his daughter no longer spoke to them . he had to do something .  i wish my son wasn  t this way anymore  . while picking up coffee , he glanced at the newspaper . the headline read :  crime lord killed in standoff  . peter dropped the coffees on the ground and ran home . he found his wife in bed with her eyes glazed over and an empty pill bottle next to her and a phone in her hand with a voice screaming  ma  am !  the officer who made the call quit the force the next day . newline newline all peter could do was cry . he was taught to think of others , yet his wishes for his family only caused death . after months of wasting his retirement money on fast food and alcohol , he decided to use his last wish for himself , as he had no one left :  i wish my life would get better  . after a few days , nothing happens , so he repeats the wish . weeks go by and he repeats the wish all day . months after he gets evicted , he walks around town muttering the wish . he walks to the top of a bridge and shouts his wish for the whole city to hear . when no one answers , he decides to take matters into his own hands and make his life better by talking to the fishes . newline newline janice had a long day ahead of her . she just started her new job as ceo at a top company in the west .

trying to live through such a tragedy . there was more like us , they grouped together to form groups and salvaged what they could to help people . newline newline the end what do you mean , you can sort of see the future ?  newline newline i sighed and sipped at my drink . i knew i should nt have told my best friend about this . newline newline  look , it s no big deal ,  i replied , setting my cup down , and rolling up the foil from my meal . newline newline  so , can you , like , win the lottery for me ? !  jen asked , her eyes going wide . newline newline  what ? no , firstly . because that d be morally wrong . secondly , because it s not that kind of gift ...  i trailed off , wondering if the word gift  was even the appropriate choice . newline newline  that kind of gift ? what does that even mean ?  she asked , around her last mouthful of burrito . newline newline i snatched the tray up from in front of us , and stood up , ready to leave the restaurant . newline newline  i knew i should nt have said anything . let s just go , please ? we need to get back home soon .  newline newline i left the table , and carried our trash to the bins by the door . i did nt even turn to look back . it was too late , now . we were nt going to make it home in time , but i did nt want to make it last any longer than it should . newline newline jen followed me into the parking lot and to her car , unlocking it with her fo , just as i reached it . we both settled in to the seats , and buckled up . newline newline  what good is this gift of yours if you ca nt profit off of it ?  she slammed the key home into the ignition . i knew she was going to badger me about this until i caved . newline newline i fidgeted in my seat , wondering how it was going to happen . was it predestined ? could i maybe change fate ? or was something in the future going to guarantee my premonition ? she started the car , and began to back out f the parking spot . newline newline  if i tell you , you have to promise not to laugh , and not to tell anyone else , ever .  i hoped she d understand the gravity of my statement.. instead , she chucklesnorted . newline newline  is it something super embarrassing ? or super stupid ? oh , oh , i know ! you know when a light is going to turn green , right ? !  she sped down the parking lot towards the intersection to leave it , gunning the engine , even though the light was clearly red . newline newline my entire body tensed as we approached the four way , the light still not changing .  nope ! definitely not it !  i barked , but too late . just as the cars tires touched the stop line , the light changed though , and we passed through the intersection safely . newline newline i relaxed , the ball of anxiety in my stomach settling . i turned to look at jen , her face a giant smile . newline newline  well then , was nt that just pure luck ?  she giggled , turned to look at me as she flicked on her turn signal , and began to turn left down a side street . newline newline  no , lets take the othe  oh shit !  my eyes returned to the road sooner than jen s , i had nt been fast enough to get her to take a different route . the car that had been previously stopped heading out of the side street had begun to make a u turn . newline newline he slammed on the brakes . i knew this was it . my body braced for impact , as jen shouted expletives that would make a sailors face go white . she was sawing at the steering wheel to no effect , we had already lost traction . newline newline the entire world seemed to slow down , as our car approached theirs . this was it , the moment that had been revealed to me earlier that day . there was no avoiding it now . finally , the impact came.. and was done . we barely tapped them , that i did not see coming . jen and i looked at each other , the color draining from her face . newline newline  god dammit.. i knew this was gon na happen ,  i said , unrolling my window , putting my head in my hands and leaning back in the seat . my stomach was completely on edge . newline newline  you.. you knew the crash was gon na happen.. ?  jen asked timidly . newline newline  nope . i knew you were gon na shit yourself .  i sighed loudly , rolling my head towards the window , looking for a little fresh air .on the misty knolls around lochshire farms , we turkeys gathered to discuss salvation . newline newline father boewak , the oldest among us and wise in the ways of things , gathered us in the center of the northern field . a grassy spot far away from where we receive our daily gifts of corn , filled with a light and chilly mist . he made his way to the center of the flock and spoke to us . newline newline  gobble to us all ! the changing of the leaves brings good fortune to us all , for thanksgiving is at hand !  newline newline  gobble ! gobble !  cried the flock . newline newline  and thanks we give ! that in our sacrifice , we shed our mortal forms and seek to be made anew in the fields of god . that with the offering of our bodies do we receive the gift of an ever stronger soul !  newline newline  gobble ! gobble !  cried the flock . newline newline  now for some community announcements . i m happy to report that in these final two weeks , our corn allotments will increase by 20  . humans be praised !  newline newline  gobble , gobble !  we cried again . gatherings were usually of this nature , but i could feel in old boewak that he had something bigger . we all could feel it , but we endured his bawkings for some time until finally , quiet fell on the flock . newline newline  finally ... i have some quite important news for you . it seems that the farmer has selected one of us to be offered ... early .  newline newline deadly silence of anticipation fell on the flock . early ? to be chosen and ascend to a new life so soon ? newline newline  and through my translations of the farmer s voice , i have learned that ... gobellia gol spotted beak ... you have been chosen .  newline newline my heart thumped in my breast . of course ... she would get picked . newline newline gobellia stepped forward , swinging her breasts in mockmodesty .  goodness ! i..i do nt know what to say ! i m so thankful to be able to do my part for the flock ! farmer be prasied !  newline newline that bitch . she never cared about the farmer . all she cared about was preening feathers and eating . she swung her large frame and accepted all kinds of congratulations from the flock . when she came to me , she pulled my head to hers in mockembrace ,  at least one of us will make momma proud  newline newline i could feel the spots on my own beak burn . newline newline much later , as i was prepared to be offered , i noticed my dear departed sister being carried away to a large white truck , with the insignia of a large boar s head on its side . newline newline i smiled in the way that only a turkey does . even the proud can be reduced to naught but coldcuts on the whims of the farmer newline newline edit : spelling newline strange to find a nice post with nobody inside , i think i ll use that ... note : this was like an hour ago that i started  newline newline newline  i sure do hope this online adventure thing really works  matt muttered to himself . newline newline he had decided his life needed more adventure and wanted to turn to hiking and other such activities . however , most of his friends were too busy for that type of thing . all of them were in different places now and had jobs they had to perform . there simply was nt enough time for a weekend getaway in the woods anymore . those days were gone ... newline newline and here matt stood at 11 writer s ave , in the town of redditt , ontario , looking forward to meeting nicholas . newline newline matt walked up to the house and knocked on the door three times ... newline newline no response newline newline he knocked again ... . newline newline no response again . he found it quite odd , there was a car in the driveway and everything . the letter he received from nick told him to come right in . but being the cautious person he is , matt decided to only enter the main foyer . newline newline nick s halls were decorated with some really oldfashioned looking pictures of wolves hanging on the walls , like you might see on your grandparents pillows . he also saw a collection of legos that went from ceiling to floor . literally , giant columns of legos stretched from ceiling to floor with all sorts of bizarre pieces here and there . each new level on the column was a different theme , which in matt s mind seemed pretty damned awesome . matt looked at the floor and found the floor would light up to the touch of his feat . he stepped to the side and found too green glowing footprints fade back to the cold black it originally was . newline newline matt then heard a sliding door shut from the back of the house . newline newline  ahhh , you must be matt  newline newline  nick ? i presume ?  newline newline  yes , come on in , have a seat in the living room . ill get you a soda . so what brings you to the adventure club ?  newline newline  well nick , i ve been wanting to hike and bike and go camping , but all my friends now are too busy for those kinds of things . it seems the best we can ever do is find a place to eat , chat a bit , and leave . it all seems so boring ... newline newline  i hear you , its okay we get plenty of people looking for an exciting time just like yourself .  newline newline  i figured , but nobody i know does this type of thing , you know , online  newline newline  well , you ll get to know plenty of people who enjoy these activities just as much as you do , and we do have regular meetings too .  newline newline  now before i can accept you as a new member we have to do a small interview for your profile page and some paperwork . which would you rather start with ?  newline newline  i guess the profile page . hey why do you need a profile anyway ?  newline newline  oh its nothing really , just sees what your interested in and if you have any experience in certain activities that the group could rely on . shall we begin ? newline newline  okay first question : what hobbies do you have ?  newline newline  i like to build things for the heck of it . in fact , i just finished my 3rd solar heater for my pool . its really efficient too , manages to heat my pool by at least another 5 degrees on a sunny day . i ve also done some home remodeling , redid the patio , my bathroom , even the kitchen . i ve swapped out the old wallpaper and put in some new stuff that looks kind of like an olive garden . so i guess you could say i m a guy who s good with all sorts of tools .  newline newline  very impressive . moving on , did you ever have an imaginary friend ? if so , describe them  newline newline  huh ?  newline newline  an imaginary friend ?  newline newline  no , i caught that part , i m not getting how this is relevant  newline newline  oh , it s just a test to see if you were imaginative as a child . its interesting to see where all that creative thinking has gone . if you can remember what your imaginary friend was like , please go ahead .  newline newline  yes , well your going to find this extremely weird  nervous laughter  but his name was also nick  newline newline  its a common name , i suppose  newline newline  yeah , but he also liked wolves a lot , and i d pretend i saw many wolves with him . and i imagined he had the largest collection of legos stretching from ceiling to floor .  newline newline  ... you are the worst liar i have ever met . come on , be honest what was your imaginary friend like ?  newline newline  no its true , and he also had a floor that would change colors when you stepped on it .  newline newline  haha , that s a good one  newline newline  i m being dead serious  newline newline  alright , what was his favorite food ?  newline newline  kraft macaroni and cheese and hot dogs .  newline newline  ice cream flavor ?  newline newline  reese s peanut butter cup  newline newline  no way ... . this is just too weird  newline newline  why is that last part weird ?  newline newline  because those two things are what stock my pantry ...  newline newline  ...  newline newline  i think i m your imaginary friend , haha  newline newline newline newline newline newlinethe winter that she was born , the snow swirled around her carrier in greeting when her parents brought her home  he took his first hesitant steps into the safety of his mother  s arms . she grew quicklyalmost too quickly as she started primary school with a grin on her face and a chirpy voice that greeted him with ,  what you name ?  and he answered with ,  what  s yours ?  newline newline the two had grown out of action figures and barbies a few winters ago , but still , every firstdayofwinter , they played together until the sun went down  this year , they went skating . the next year  s firstdayofwinter was the first time that she had spent it alone in her room . newline newline to her , middle school was a blur of boys and bad decisions , of late nights with girlfriends and tentative kisses  to him , it was spent in an eternal summer that turned his snowy childhood into a tantalizing dreamland filled with laughter and light . high school was different they both drifted , confused and unsure , wondering when they  d meet someone with whom to share each blustery day . newline newline she graduated college in the spring  he took an extra semester of philosophy to figure out what he wanted to do . the next snowfall , they both took a leap of faith and moved away to start their new careers . newline newline skating had always been her favourite when she was younger , so it was only fitting that , as she stepped onto a rink for the first time in years , she heard a familiar voice jokingly say ,  hey , what  s your name again ?  newline newline her wrinkled hand reached out to touch his cheek for the third time that hour he remembered their youth when she would caress his cheek before they kissed but this was as she stuttered ,  hello ... what ... what you name ?  newline newline as he stared at the snow flying past his window , he knew he  d always remember her .i looked around the office , trying to control the anxiety building up inside my chest . just breathe , jake , i told myself . you re just here to find out how it works . you have nt signed anything , have nt agreed to anything yet . newline newline whoever designed the office , at least , had been well aware of the anxiety that its visitors might feel . most of the walls were paneled in dark wood , and a large fountain in the middle of the room sent a small waterfall cascading down amid lush green vegetation . i felt more like i d accidentally stepped into a spa , or perhaps an upscale massage parlor , rather than a dating service . newline newline  jake hoffman ?  newline newline i glanced up at my name , and saw a tall , efficientlooking brunette in a tightly tailored navy suit looking back at me .  yeah ,  i said , rising up from the low bench where i d been sitting and gazing blearily into the stream of falling water .  that s me .  newline newline she smiled at me , an efficient and businesslike smile that she d probably practiced a thousand times in the mirror .  right this way , mr . hoffman .  newline newline i followed behind the woman as we headed down a corridor , presumably towards her office . i tried to keep my eyes up , not letting them stray down to her pert little ass , snugly bound in her pencil skirt . i doubted that the employees put themselves into the dating pools . newline newline the woman led me into an office , where i took a seat in front of a large desk as she closed the door .  so , mr. hoffman ,  she said , slipping back around to sit across from me .  what brings you to set for life ?  newline newline the question i d been dreading . i shrugged , trying to look casual .  i guess i just have nt been having much success on my own in the dating game , and a couple of my buddies raved about this place  newline newline  those would be kyle and alexis harris , yes ?  the woman interrupted , glancing down at the chart she d laid on the desk in front of her . newline newline i started .  uh , yeah , that s them . how d you know  newline newline  we do our research , mr. hoffman ,  the woman answered me before i d finished the question .  there s a reason why we re able to guarantee that our arranged marriages are successful  we know they ll work .  newline newline there it was . arranged marriage . something that would be considered unthinkable just a couple of decades earlier , now considered commonplace and totally ordinary . and people were choosing it , more and more  i was finally convinced to come in to set for life after reading about how their ipo topped five billion . newline newline  so are you , like , my case agent ?  i asked . newline newline the woman smiled , and stood up to hold her hand out across the desk to me .  i m gena davis , mr. hoffman . and yes , if you choose to employ us , i ll be the one working with you .  newline newline i took the hand , trying not to grip it too tightly . she felt warm , fragile , like a songbird .  nice to meet you , gena . i guess i m just not fully sold yet .  newline newline  well , i ll be happy to help steer you in the right direction ,  gena said . she smiled at me , revealing a perfect row of brilliantly whitened teeth .  i can start off with a number , perhaps  thirtyfour percent .  newline newline  what s that ?  newline newline  that ,  gena replied , still smiling ,  is the percentage of single individuals in the united states who are currently using a dating service . nearly twenty percent of all singles in the us are signed with set for life . that s a lot of potential mates , mr . hoffman .  newline newline i nodded  i had nt realized that the market was so big .  right , but it just scares me . marriage , that is . i mean , it s forever ! what happens if the woman changes , does nt stay the same ?  newline newline gena smiled .  mr. hoffman , you re not the same person that you were ten years ago , are you ?  newline newline  well , no , but  newline newline  everybody changes , mr . hoffman .  she leaned forward , interlacing her fingers on the desk in front of her .  but we find someone who changes along with you , someone who grows as you grow , who will mature in the same way that you mature . we can find someone who s perfect for you now , but also in the future , many years down the road .  newline newline i opened my mouth , but then closed it . wow , that did sound perfect .  but i have to pay for this ?  newline newline  only if we succeed , mr . hoffman .  gena s smile kept on radiating out at me , pure white and almost blinding .  as you know , we do take a tithe from our married members , but we wo nt charge you a single cent unless you re happy . you ve heard our guarantee .  newline newline indeed , i had  on the radio , on television , on billboards , from friends . it was part of the reason i was here .  we only charge for happiness ,  i repeated . newline newline she nodded .  now , we ll have some tests for you , of course , but nothing today . all i need to know is if you re interested .  newline newline i took a deep breath , and then took the plunge .  yeah , okay . i m interested .  newline newline her smile did nt waver .  wonderful , mr. hoffman . i can assure you that you re making the right choice . you wo nt find anyone out there who speaks badly of us .  newline newline  yeah , right ,  i said , as i followed gena s pert little butt back out to the entrance to the set for life office .  great . uh , call me when you ve got a wife for me .  newline newline gena s laugh tinkled after me as she held the door open .  relax , mr. hoffman . you re in for a long life of happiness , now that you ve signed on with us .  she winked at me as i left .  we guarantee it .  newline newline  newline newline want more ? well , i have nt written any  but you can read other stories of mine at rromanticon .   timmy   : i m just sayin  the bigger , the better ! obviously the most powerful cards make the most powerful strategies ! and my deck is full of huge monsters ! newline newline   spike   : your deck is full of unplayable junk , more like . i d have more success with one of johnny s creations if they were nt so suspect . newline newline   johnny   : excuse me ? says the one who ca nt create anything without having a direct line to the internet . you re both creatively bankrupt . newline newline   timmy   : who needs creativity ? a strong deck is a strong deck ! newline newline   spike   : yeah , like this bad boy . newline newline   johnny   : this is ... newline newline   spike   : haha ... . newline newline   timmy   : no dragons ? no demons ? no angels ? not even a tiny little kraken ? newline newline   spike   : no one asked you , tim . newline newline   johnny   : you ca nt tell me you d have fun playing this monstrosity . newline newline   spike   : some people enjoy winning ? newline newline   timmy   : some people enjoy having friends ? newline newline   johnny   : winning or friends is nt an issue , it s just ... this deck does the same thing , over and over again . according to einstein , that s the definition of insanity ! newline newline   spike   : and according to keyboarddojocagefgtrs.com , this list made top 8 of the last national tournament ! newline newline   timmy   : pfft . none of your monsters are big , none of your spells do anything cool . why bother ? might as well be playing checkers . newline newline   johnny   : this entire conversation is pointless . can we all just agree that we re all good at one thing and suck at one thing ? newline newline   spike and timmy   : what ! ? newline newline   johnny   : think about it . i m good at finding obscure combos and cards no one knows about . timmy s decks are nt the best but they re always fun to play and do huge things . and you , well ... you have the math and brains to play anything perfectly , but you re a creativity black hole . timmy s kind lf a spaz , and i m too much of a hipster to win consistently . newline newline   everyone   : ... ... newline newline   timmy   : guys ? i have an idea . newline newline   spike   : that s a first . newline newline   johnny   : shut up , spike . what is it , tim ? newline newline   timmy   : let s all build a single deck and enter the next tournament as a team . if we cover our bases , we can really go far . newline newline   spike   : heh ... i guess we could use your collection and johnny s building skills . but i am team captain . newline newline   johnny   : wait , you re on board with this ? oh lord ... newline newline   timmy   : i love you guys . newline newline   spike   : we might make something out of you scrubs yet !they paid me thirty five dollars an hour to follow around their son during the weekend . not bad for a struggling actor like myself , but they did nt give me a single detail about this  imaginary friend  of his . this was going to be a challenge , but i knew that i was up for it . being that it was the weekend , i did nt need to follow him to school , and all he did was stay in his room anyway  odd for a twelve year old kid . i was waiting in his rather large bedroom when he opened the door , unperturbed by my presence . newline newline  hi christopher ,  i said almost too eagerly ,  it s me .  he paused and looked at me with the same expressionless face he came in with , and then continued past me directly to his computer .  do you.. know who i am ?  i asked , afraid i sounded nervous and that he was nt even buying this act . newline newline  do you know who you are ?  i furrowed my brow and , trying to sound more confident , exclaimed  i m your imaginary friend of course !  he just looked at me .  interesting  he said , his voice cold and cruel .  what makes you think you re my imaginary friend ?  newline newline  because it s me , your friend !  am i really arguing with a child about me being his imaginary friend ?  we can be friends ,  he said without turning his head from the computer ,  but you are not my imaginary friend , douglas .  newline newline  how do you know my name ? did you hear me and your parents talking ?  this little job is derailing and i am certainly not experienced enough to handle it .  my parents ?  he asked almost immediately , except this time his voice broke from its monotonous tone .  yeah your parents . i give up , you already know your parents hired me this is pointless .  newline newline  they hired you ?  this kid was not getting it , and i have auditions i could be going on rather than argue with a child .   yes your parents hired me .   i got up from his bed to leave before he immediately stood up .  you ca nt leave .  i headed straight for his door ,  listen kid i do nt have time for this i have audi  newline newline  what did my parents look like ?  he asked abruptly . i froze for a moment .  they..  why ca nt i remember ?  ignore it , why am i even entertaining the question .  who is the president of the united states ?  what ?  i felt drowsy .  douglas ? can you tell me where you live ?  i tried to open my mouth but could nt speak ... . newline newline newline newline i watched from the window in the hallway as i held our son close . i could hear them yelling over the piercing screams of the monitors . he clasped his hands around his ears  do nt worry christopher , daddy will be okay soon .  newline newline  newline newline first prompt ! feedback is encouraged ! well , here you go .  newline newline dji shrugged her shoulders , then snapped her fingers . a white vignette crept into my vision and slowly overtook everything into a blinding light . with a loud thoom , i found myself . literally . i was standing in front of myself and dji . newline newline  dji , what the hell ? !  newline newline my past self and dji stared at me . newline newline  uh ...  she pointed behind me . newline newline there was my dji . newline newline  you asked for me to take you to the moment before you made your biggest mistake . that was your wish . you could have wished for anything in the entire universe . i could end the entire concept of suffering . i could make it so no person goes hungry or homeless ever again . i could get you and your family a literal mountain of gold and jewels , and i could do it every day for the rest of eternity . i could make you immortal . invincible . i could save one person in history or all of history . newline newline and you ask me to , ahem ,  she transformed into another version of me .  take me back to the moment before i made my biggest mistake .  it was my voice , but a much more mocking tone . newline newline  what kind of vague opinionated bullcrap is that ? ! how am i supposed to know what you consider your biggest mistake ? ! i m not going to sort through your freaking head . you tell me what you want , i do it . boom . that s the deal . you might as well have said  i wish you would tell me what i should wish for .  your biggest mistake was made less than a minute ago when those words left your lips . so here it is . you missed a chance to do whatever you want or get what you need in your life for the rest of eternity.  newline newline she poofed back into her normal self .  you re lucky i m a nice djin . i could have sent you here to look at your stupidity without an explanation and a wasted wish . but no . i m feeling nice and condescending today so you get another shot . no timey wimey b.s . excuse me .  newline newline she went over to herself and said something in a language i could nt make out . newline newline pastdji gave a familiar shrug .  guess that works since i technically have nt given this exact kid a wish yet .  she walked over to me and pat me on the head .  well , feel like making a wish this time , sport ?  newline newline  sure  newline newline  i  m a lazy man . i bank online , shop once a month at saveco , and i have a prime membership which i use to repeat order for items like toilet paper when i don  t want to get in the car . what do i do with my free time ? well , let  s just say that wikipedia does not write itself , hmmk ? oh . one more thing . i make my living as a contract killer . how many have i killed ? zero . yeah , no crap . i  m a virgin . how do i do it ? i  m lazy , remember , i subcontract out . this is a story about how that saved my life . newline newline i work mainly for a guy named mike . not big mike or red mike , or boss mike , just mike . he seemed like a normal guy . he was the so , that  s security officer not significant other , for initech , a tech company in in the local business park . every so often he contracted me to take out some startup guy who was asking a bit too much for a buyout . newline newline i took his money and gave half to one of my girls to finish the job . no , i don  t use girls because they are sexy , i use them because they are moms who need the money . also , have you looked at the murder conviction rates for women in their midthirties ? exactly . keyser soze they are not . anyway , mike calls me up last week and tells me to take out some guy named tom smykowski who won  t part with his new invention . i fire up my modem and relay the target info over email to my best girl . newline newline here  s the kicker . about an hour later jen calls me back .  pete  she says ,  i got three things to tell you . first , i  ve been taking some work on the side hitting for another man , second , that guy  s name is tom smykowski.  i  m stunned but not too dumb that i can  t count and hold my tongue .  pete , third thing , tom sent me an email listing you as a target . you  re supposed to have invented some new banking software or something.  newline newline i start to speak when she cuts me off . she says she  s out , she doesn  t want anything more to do with it . the last thing she does is connect me with tom . she does a three way call and he  s on the line . before he can say hello she hangs up . we  re alone . newline newline tom introduces himself , his voice nasally . i can tell he doesn  t exercise much so , if we have to fight , at least we  ll be on even terms . he tells me he works for a guy named mike and mike wants me dead . i confirm the same . tom says what we are both thinking first .  pete , i don  t want to kill you but i  m a bit pissed at mike right now . i think he has to go.  newline newline i smile into the phone .  tom  i say ,  don  t you worry about it . i  ll take care of mike.  he thanks me , makes sure i  m not going to be gunning for him , and hangs up . simple as that . i flip the modem on and hear it  s familiar tones connecting me to the web . jen won  t do the job but there is a girl named anne that used to do jobs for me . what can i say , i  m lazy .the crowd disappeared almost as fast as anxiety took over my mind . i leaned against the side of a damp building to gain my balance . it was just a notification , i told myself . it did nt mean anything . newline newline i closed my eyes , trying to remember the damn safe place my therapist kept telling me to imagine . the crackling of a fireplace . the smell of caramel on vanilla ice cream . the warmth and softness of being wrapped in a blanket . newline newline black fog covered me as i mustered the courage to face the world . newline newline i fidgeted for my phone and called sarah . she answered after three rings . newline newline  david , where are you ?  she asked , her voice gentle . newline newline  i thought i was heading downtown , but i ca nt tell anymore ,  i managed to say . i did nt why i was whispering .  you have to help me , i ca nt see anything but black fog here .  newline newline there was a giant crash in the distance , with a cloud of smoke and dust rising above the thick fog . newline newline  what was that ?  panic slowly seeping into her voice . newline newline  i do nt know .  newline newline  i just checked ... no one knows what s happening . facebook only says to evacuate the area immediately . i am calling 911 . david , stay where you are .  newline newline  i ca nt ...  newline newline i heard the faint screeching of sirens as i decided to run . it only took 5 strides for me to run facefirst into a metal pole . newline newline  david , the police are nt picking up !  i heard her say over the ringing in my head . newline newline i look around for my phone , blood dripping from my forehead . i pinpoint its location by following the sound of sarah s staticinfused voice . how did the phone get so far ? newline newline i crawled to it , as the fog was nt as thick this close to the ground . three distinct booms sounded near me . i covered my head and screamed , thinking they were gunshots . newline newline covering my mouth , i lunged at the phone . newline newline  sarah !  i said as loudly as i dared . newline newline tiktiktiktik . newline newline  sarah , i need you !  newline newline tiktiktiktik . newline newline that was the only sound that came from the phone . newline newline dull thuds approached me . i stood up , running in the other direction . newline newline cold hands grabbed me the shoulders . i screeched and kicked and punched but the hands overpowered me . newline newline  sir ! we are here to help !  shouted a man , letting me down on my feet . newline newline  thank you ,  i said , calming down . i took the moment to gather my breath , still feeling the cold from where the man had gripped me . newline newline  what s the military doing here ?  i asked , after taking a closer look at his uniform . newline newline the man sighed , even though his stony eyes betrayed no emotion .

first place.  eric said with a calm voice , as he saw boris johnsons hand gripping on to the side of the container for dear life . newline newline  shouldn  t we help him ?  frank said after 5 minutes of staring at boris , slowly trying to climb out of the container .  i guess we should.  eric said  you grab his arms , and i will try and grab his neck.  frank and eric trotted closer to the container , when they heard something coming from the container . newline newline  i need your help bro !  baffled by the sound boris made , they stopped .  what did he just call me ?  frank said . eric looked at frank in a peculiar way .  i didn  t know you had a brother , frank . why didn  t you tell me sooner ?  boris one again called from the container  come on ! help a bro out !  newline newline  you heard your bro  eric said to frank .  come on , help him.  eric backed off a little and left the work to frank . newline newline after much effort boris was pulled out of the radioactive

minute . are you that guy ?  a man asks as he walks up to the bar , thumping his left hand on the table . newline newline  yea . i  m that guy.  i answer , sipping my drink . newline newline  man , they  re right . you don  t look so good.  newline newline i take another drink , seeing that nothing is left but ice and watered down whisky i  ve been milking . i don  t reply to the man next to me . i don  t even look at him . i just raise my glass to signal to the bartender , joe i think is his name , for another . newline newline  hey , hey ,  he gives me a slap on the back .  say the line . please say the line.  newline newline i groan ,  in case i don  t see you ,  which i haven  t yet ,  good afternoon , good evening and goodnight.  it s in sort of a dead flare . some inflections , but no enthusiasm . newline newline i  m still holding up my glass , rattling it now , needing a drink more than ever . that line  that life newline newline i turn to the man next to me , finally getting a good look at him . he  s got a usual face , no point in wasting words describing him .  you ever see shawshank redemption ?  i ask him while my drink is being filled , and he is handed a beer . newline newline i get the slap on the back again , and he now takes a firm seat next to me . everyone his age grew up with me , and thinks they know me personally enough .  who the hell hasn  t ! it  s a great film.  before i even think whether or not i should engage in conversation , something i would have done before , he starts in again .  oh yea . yea i get it man . prison  sanctuary . yea.  newline newline i suck my teeth , i can feel the reply about to surge  no . you don  t get it !  but his response was only my fault . i know that . i provoked it . i only reply  yup.   defeated . newline newline  hey man , what happened to that girl ? i mean i heard about the split , but tell me , what really happened ? why did it happen ? why the hell are you even here in this shit hole anyway ?  newline newline so that was it , my complete indifference opened a conversation , annoyance and sheer exhaustion led me to give in to him in order to get rid of him and have my peace . newline there  s an empty table and chairs just across the bar in a quiet corner . i grab my glass and head towards it waving for him to follow . this happens nearly every night i come here . sometimes i indulge them . sometimes i dump my drink in their laps and tell them to piss off or something like that . sometimes i m obnoxious and make a scene , inviting others . sometimes it  s all of the above in random order . newline newline we sit there . i cup my glass with two hands now , pondering , rubbing off the condensation , twisting it , spinning it .  so the girl , is that all you want to know ? or do you want the whole thing ?  newline newline  i got plenty of time ! hey , can i get a picture with you too ?  newline newline this guy is all over the place . i lean in for the  selfie .  god , i can only predict the comments ,  that guy  s still alive ?   oh man , he looks like shit ?   who the hell is truman ?   is that that guy from that show ?  newline newline  from the beginning ?  i ask newline newline  from the beginning.  he replies , nodding eagerly . newline newline  i left . you know that . i rushed into her arms . you know that too . i embraced the smell of real , fresh air for the first time in my life . you saw it , almost 20 years ago now . and the first few days were complete bliss . i was like a four year old on his first field trip to the farm . all senses were activated  good smells and bad smells were allllll good smells , tastes was intense , the sounds , touching everything , seeing everything . lauren  sylvia loved it . she let me call her lauren.  newline newline i take a drink , noticing now that this man , whose name i don  t even know or care to know really is fixed on me . newline  so of course the show was ruined ,  i continued .  i had to immediately deal with that nightmare court cases , hearings , talk show interviews . i was pulled every single direction , but lau  sylvia was my center  my point of reference . the problem is i had freak outs and fits . i  m a man of passion , and i  m triggered easily . it drove me to her in the first place , and it drove her away from me after a time . newline  then there were those who were pissed about the show ending . they were still entitled to my life , our life . newline newline  those first months were only the times of early anger storms . things quieted , letting the anger fester . everything set me off . anytime she or anyone wanted something , i gave them the opposite , 10fold !  i was becoming a little animated with my gestures . becoming aware of it , i revive my serious tone again .  or she would try to calm me down . shh . it s going to be ok . shhh .  and i d come back at her , i m not a fucking kid . ooo k !   newline newline my drink is empty again . i hold the glass up , rock it , bang on the table ,  hey , over here , come onnnn !  newline newline  jack ass ,  ashley , the cocktail waitress says , slamming the fresh glass on the table . newline newline  you love it .  i reply newline newline  want another ?  she asks the stranger . newline newline  hmmm , umm ,  he looks at the bottle , three quarters empty and starts sputtering noises while trying to decide .  pfffff , ohhhh , uhhh . yea , yep.  he drums the table , announcing his decision .  yep . i ll take another .  then to me ,  ok , back to it . i mean i saw your movies . you were great !  newline newline  yep . i was . i was great . i probably still am . but no one can work with that guy .   i mock .  i was angry , but then you learn how just shitty the real world is . the fucking holocaust , north korea , poverty , animal abuse , starvation , religious wars , assholes in general . newline  you know , kids are resilient when they learn about this stuff . their minds are flexible and they learn about it gradually . you hear it for the first time in your 30s , and you literally have to have someone lock you up to prevent you from going on a killing spree , or killing yourself . i  m am a reallife fallen angel ! newline  so naturally , bad days on set made me go into near murderous rampages , at least in my head . i d never do it . but i d always want to .  newline newline  you ever want to kill her ?  he interrupts just as ashley returns with his drink . newline newline  yep .  i answered twisting my glass .  it got bad . she left . and i did nt miss her . newline  my anger got worse . i did nt get booked . money was getting low . became a oneseason reality joke . lost media interest as a train wreck . it s a slow spiral . i m surprised it went on so long . newline  like shawshank , i wanted to go back  back to my eden . but you can  t . you can go back to prison . you can  t go back to an illusion after unmasking it . newline newline  yea , so how do they even let you out in public ?  newline newline i laugh ,  ooo , i m such a monster . how do they let him walk free !  i twist my class more as i think back .  well , you know . you hit rock bottom , as they say , and there are somehow people in the world who still care about you . rehab wasn  t going to work for someone like me . i was out of my element entirely . at this point , there wasn  t the fear of media so much . being a hasbeen has its advantages . so you know what they did , they got me connected to this real renegade therapist . she had these wild ideas for past clients , but it worked . she had a track record . newline  so she met with me a few times , and finally pitched this really crazy idea . i shit you not , she suggested i live in a zoo . live in a zoo !  the stranger bursts into a short laugh . i gulp my drink , nod and agree .  yea . yea i know . her idea was that it was a sort of  truman show  for animals , and it might be the next best thing for me . it might help me cope . it might be the best stepping stone to get me rehabilitated.  newline newline  so did you do it ? were you in with animals ? did people watch you ?  the stranger asked  he  s  the stranger  now since i don  t care to find out his name . newline newline  yea , this is the chapter in my life no one really knows about . i did it . i was reluctant , but i was also ready to try anything . newline  so they sent me to a place overseas . couldn  t be in the us enough people would recognize me , and it wouldn  t do me any good . and yea i was in with the animals . it was one of those exhibits where they have a mix of different kinds , harmless kinds . i wore zookeeper gear so i just looked like a worker . and i had to shovel shit and feed them . but i lived among them . it was great too . you  d have these families who were there every weekend  and i gave them a new greeting . i became truman again !  newline newline  so it sounds like it worked !  the stranger said . newline newline  well , i haven  t slit your throat in my mind yet.  he didn  t laugh at my response .  yea , it worked well enough . it worked for a time . i had consistency . i had people watching me work , i had regulars come visit me , still thinking i was just a newline keeper . they watched me interact with the animals . the animals had their habits . everyone had their rituals . everyone had a  script.  it was a world all for me . newline  but i can guess your next question   so why are you here now  maaahhaaannn ?  well the  therapy  worked in calming my anger . it worked in sort of weening me out of illusion and into the real world because not everything was controlled . zookeepers were real people . but they weren  t totally my friends . in their mind , i was just an animal . and that seemed to fit what i deserved , but i didn  t like that very much . so i came back . i keep quiet and rot in this little bar . sometimes i go back to the zoo . i  m welcome there any time i need to just get away . but then i get restless again , and come back here . it works . i hate real people for the most part , but i can live with them now . newline newline  man , that  s incredible stuff . did you ever get all spiritual at the zoo ? find some sort of inner light ?  the stranger asked . newline newline i take a tiny drink , sigh ,  you only get one tonight.  i m not ready to dive into another part of my life that was more disappointing .  yea . i  m done ,  i say firmly , raising my eyebrow and turning to him for dramatic effect . i knock my half empty cup into his lap . ice , water and whisky are saturating his lower shirt and pants . newline  hey , what the hell man ?  he asks as i get up and move back toward the bar . newline i turn back to him , midway to the bar and say ,  hey , in case i don  t see you again , good afternoon , good evening and guhhoood night !  newline newline you want a fucking story ? what am i , a baby sitter ? no , you re going to hell , fuck you .  dammit . i do nt know why we ever installed the waiting room to intercept my daily jogging path . it s stupid what those idiot souls want before they end up in their final destination . but hey , now the story s in my head . awesome . brilliant . what a douchebag lars was . and i deal with a lot of douchebags , duh , but this guy was like the epicenter of sleaze . disgusting . the worst ones disgust me . they re always so obnoxiously emphatic about being evil . i mean , i get wanting to piss some passersby off , or hell , tormenting a few acquaintances , but there comes a point where it s just trying too hard . lars tried way too damn hard . but he was good , the bastard . i remember watching , mildly interested , as he slipped no more than fifteen roofies that night , took seven of em home . do nt recall what he did to them . okay i do , but come now , let s keep his trade secrets . he was so good at being such a racist , shitbag , cruel little fucker . everyone hated him . i mean quite literally everyone he met wanted , at some point , to put a dagger against the pig s throat . i was even mildly surprised when lars was the one to do it . i guess he finally realized he was a jackass , shit maybe he just got bored , it happens . but goddammit , i d grown , dare i say it , fond of the creep . such a disgusting stain on god s perfect  world . he could do so much shit alive , and so little dead . so i admit it , i was the one who called the ambulance over ... i made up for it and gave the driver s grandma a heart attack the next day , so it was all good and fair ... . but really , i should check in on that bastard again soon , come to think of it . lars , boy , have i got a special suite here just for you . go get em  my limp dark brown hair falls in front of my face , where images of the last few days flashed in my eyes . stuck in this concrete room with nothing but the dirty and putrid clothing on my body . newline newline her laugh , oh her laugh . when i began to be friends with her , i never would have guessed that she would be capable of something so sardonic . i start laughing , the broken laugh hurt even my own ears . it was really all my fault . i should ve have taken care of her when i could have . newline newline now she sent me here to die , between concrete sheer walls that seemed to creep in . ready to attack me in my most venerable moment . just like the she devil . newline newline my mouth is dry and my vison is spotted with black dots . my dreams are filled with nightmares of her controlling me like a puppet . my daydreams all filled with the blood of mary splattered everywhere . newline newline the dark red seemed to compliment mary s adorable blue eyes and childish blonde hair in pig tails . the perfect innocent girl act . i scoff out loud . my broken nails and scratch marks up my arms from when i pretended i was mary . newline newline i smile devilishly as i yell ,  i m coming for you ,  and start laughing ,  hehe , your blood everywhere , i m going to kill you , haheha , i m going to kill you , scream and beg but you ll watch your own blood spill ,  i finish off with a strong blow to the wall , successfully breaking my fist . the pain traveling up my arm only incited me to getting my revenge .it started out with a mostlyfinished jar of raspberry jam , and a distinct lack of any jars of usable peanut butter . newline newline well , that was nt entirely true . george had peanut butter , just not any peanut butter suitable for eating . newline newline there happened to be a single , neglected jar of crunchy peanut butter shoved in the back of the cabinet in order to hide its evil presence . but today , it had made itself known . george had gone to make himself a sandwich for lunch  he always ate creamy peanut butter and raspberry jam on whole wheat bread , no substitutions  only to discover that a jar of that vile substance had somehow managed to infiltrate his cabinet . he must ve bought it by mistake at some point , but that was nt an excuse . crunchy peanut butter was an abomination , a freak of nature that had no valid reason for even existing , except possibly for those strange freaks who actually enjoyed it . they were probably the same people who feasted on the corpses of dead children . they could enjoy their meals of crunchy peanut butter and infant blood . but for george , it would not suffice . newline newline using tongs so as not to contaminate himself , george reached into the cabinet and extricated the foul substance , which he then thrust into the already open trash compactor . good . his house was cleansed of that evil  the exorcism was complete . newline newline however , that solved only half of his problem : he was still missing the creamy peanut butter . he would have to go to the grocery store . newline newline the grocery store , as always , was horrible . mindless shoppers racing through aisles with their carts , broken pickle jars littering the floor , constant announcements crackling over the loudspeaker that were interrupted by jarring hisses of static , flickering fluorescent lights that buzzed furiously and stabbed the eye , and of course that one baby that would nt stop crying no matter how many times the mother attempted to coax it into silence . but all this would be worth it if he could only get the creamy peanut butter . newline newline the peanut butter . that was the objective . nothing else mattered . newline newline except for that his foot was run over several times , and that someone broke a carton of eggs onto his shirt , and that all three of the selfcheckout machines he tried to use refused to cooperate , the trip to the grocery store was uneventful . 20 minutes after he had entered , george left the grocery store clutching his left foot . he may have been frustrated , injured , and covered in unborn chicken , but he was victorious . newline newline after arriving home , george fell back into his usual lunchtime routine . it always went in the following order : jam , peanut butter , bread , knife , spoon  create sandwich , enjoy . it was a process he had refined to an art : after collecting all of the ingredients and the utensils , george would paint the peanut butter onto the bread like some student of picasso  he would apply the jelly with the precision of a surgeon  and he would then gently place the second piece of bread atop his peanutbutterandjelly painting to complete the masterpiece . for the final touch , a diagonal cut  never a vertical one down the center  from the top right corner to the bottom left one . newline newline now that he had his creamy peanut butter  not that nasty crunchy ooze  he could begin his allimportant routine . newline newline lovingly , george removed the jar of raspberry jam from the fridge and placed it upon the table . he carefully removed his treasure , his prize , from the brown paper bag , and set it down next to the jam . one jar of peter pan peanut butter , creamy . worth far more than  4.29 . newline newline he headed over to bread box , already salivating at the sandwich he would soon enjoy . it took only a second for all his happiness to be destroyed as he looked at the bread box . newline newline george slammed his fist against the counter and began to sob . o , fortuna , the cruelest of mistresses ! newline newline he would have to return to that dreaded hellhole known as the supermarket . he was out of whole wheat bread .it had been three weeks since i saw my last human . the numbers are dwindling down and i have enough ammunition to kill for the next 20 years . i made a pact with my neighbor . his name is ralph . he s a good guy , originally from new york city , smokes cigarettes in his garage with posters of the sopranos and yankees covering the walls . sometimes when he would catch an extra squirrel , he would bring it over . we were both around the same age , fifty something , we had lost count . the separate houses were ideal for privacy and i never really trusted the guy ... ralph seemed like an honorable man , but always had an eerie air about him . newline i was eating breakfast when i realized i only had ten minutes left to live . knocking over my glass of orange juice , i sprinted outside with my rifle and knife , and tried to start my car . dead . my bike was rusted away at this point . i sat in the driveway thinking for five minutes of my options , when i suddenly hear a knock on my window . it s ralph . newline newline  hey , where you going buddy ? getting some food for me ? it s been a while since you brought home anything better than a sparrow ,  he joked . newline newline  yeah i ve been hungry for some venison for months now ,  i replied . newline newline  must be from other hunters , i have nt seen any myself . if you get one , throw me a leg , alright ?  he joked as he turned around to walk back up his driveway . newline newline i did nt want to , but time was running out . he was a great friend for years , but i wanted to live . i lifted my rifle at him as he turned around . newline newline  good luck out th ... hey what are you doing ?  he said . newline newline  i m sorry ... i only have two minutes left ,  i exclaimed with tears in my eyes . newline newline  that s alright . i ve only got five minutes myself . sorry ,  ralph said as he quickly pulled on me . newline newline  i m so sorry . i need to live . you were a good friend .  ralph cried .  i ca nt keep killing people . it s been decades of this ...  newline newline a final shot echoed throughout the empty neighborhood as his body hit the paved driveway . newline newlineevery time i hear the word warmth  , i see my little redbricked home sitting a little to the side of winding country road . it s the first house on a street that goes nowhere . newline newline in the evening , the sun would set in my window . i never knew the start of the day , but i always watched the spectacular colors of its death . i d catch my breath , watch it dip below lilacs and oaks . the old peat oven that kept us warm as much as it kept the smell of a crackling fire in the walls . newline newline cemented in the corners are every fight borne beyond the control of my parents . every word thrown at school that i d throw back at the mirror . the surrender of my dad in every difficult conversation . newline newline there were few photographs , but a cache of laughter and tears . a swirl of moments that feel separated from reality with their wealth of emotion . newline newline the concussion that gave me gaps in my fading memory happened here , too . i struggle not to carelessly cast out what little i know . it was an accident . an accident that takes so much . that keeps being so much . newline newline i watched the sun cast her last breaths on my dollhouses , my vanity table , my bedspread , my noose , my packed boxes . it was never truly my house again after i left for college . it s beautiful , more now than before , but it will never again be home . newline newline home exists only in my dying memory and the word warmth  .they called freddy the bar clearer  , because every bar he went in , all the women cleared out . if you ve ever busted a guy s lip who was hitting on your little kid sister , there s a good chance that was freddy . john , the manager , gave an exasperated groan from the vip box , as he saw freddie swagger up to the bar . the bouncers would have to be severely reprimanded for this breach of security . already , the girls beside freddie were packing their drinks into their purses , getting ready to peel . that s when the first blast of thunder shook the club . the lights flicked off for a minute , replaced by the club s emergency backup generator  the music was cut off . newline newline  holy sheep !  exclaimed alex , the senior bouncer , using all his muscles to yank the door shut behind him .  boss ,  he yelled up at the vip box ,  it s a flashstorm like you never seen before ! george got swept away !  george was the junior bouncer . john , the manager , felt a brief moment of relief , george was probably the one responsible for letting freddy bar clearer  get inside , and now john would be spared from having to dress him down . the relief was quickly forgotten when the second blast shook the building . all the girls screamed . newline newline they were nt screaming about the weather . it was freddy , he had gotten his shirt off and was doing his infamous party trick , wiggling his mantits at anyone with eyeballs . newline newline  maam , you ca nt go out there ,  alex said , catching a bachelorette party queen in his big burly arms . she and her entourage were fleeing freddy like their lives depended on it . the bridetobe squirmed out of her fancy dancing dress , pushed the door open in nothing but her underwear , and immediately vanished into the maelstrom outside . before you could lick your fingers , the whole bachelorette party was gone .  damn it !  alex was holding onto the frame of the door to prevent being sucked out himself . with all his pullups strength he dragged himself in , narrowly dodging a table that flew out because of the pressure difference . slammed the door again and this time he locked it . newline newline either there was a surprise justin bieber concert , or else freddy was up to another of his tricks : it was nothing but screaming girls wherever you turned your ears . sure enough , there was freddy , up on the bar , dancing and shaking his hips . newline newline  sir ,  john the manager had worked his way down out of the vip box ,  i m going to have to ask you to sit down quietly until this storm passes !  he made a move to grab freddy , but freddy was too caught up in the dance to notice . right where skrillex would drop the base  in the imaginary song playing in freddy s head , freddy performed a tremendous kick , accidentally nicking the manager in the face . the manager stumbled backward , impaling himself on a coat rack . poor john , catching his guts in his hands , pinned to the wall like a jacket , and the last sight he saw was freddy blowing kisses to disgusted patrons . newline newline  enough !  bellowed alex . he had grabbed the club machine gun from its hiding spot behind the bar . arms still trembling from his ordeal at the door , he struggled to aim . another thundercrash drowned out the roar of the gun s mighty motor . but freddy danced and swerved , the mating dance of his kind , and every bullet missed . bullets pierced the walls and the ceiling , and the stormrains swept in . bullets pierced the shrieking girls , liberating them from freddy s oppression . when the clip ran out , only freddy and alex were left standing , in a club that was rapidly disintegrating into the relentless storm around it . newline newline  where d everyone go ?  freddy finally finished his dance number and clambered off the bar .  hey alex . i always wanted to get you alone , you beast .  newline newline  you ... you re gay ?  alex could nt believe it . was there even one single girl in town that had nt rejected freddy at one time or another ? but then again , none of them ever gave freddy a chance to say more than one word before . maybe his intentions had been misunderstood all along ? newline newline  as gay as john wayne ,  freddy sidled up beside alex . both men s bodies shimmered with sweat and muddy stormwater . newline newline  i ... i never knew ,  alex said , tossing the machinegun aside and embracing freddy .  why did nt you let me know sooner !  newline newline as they embraced , the storm winds finally ripped down the walls and the ceiling . maybe the storm that night was fate , i do nt know . but from that day forward , no girl in town was bothered by freddy s advances ever again .i m alone , but i m happy . newline i tell myself this lie every day hoping it will make life easier , but i take a good look around and i just see a void . it s this void that drives me crazy . i want my life to mean something , but without someone cheering me on it seems pointless . it s almost like i do nt exist . newline i fall asleep , hoping that by some miracle when i awaken , my life will change and the nothingness would subside into something . a purpose that will carry me through my remaining years . giving me some sort of hope and accomplishment , that i could truly be proud of . it feels as though i fall asleep regularly , hoping this would eventually happen . maybe i still have optimism left in me , but i can only imagine it s a tiny shard that glistens when i feel the weight of the world upon my shoulders . maybe one day i will wake up and i ll truly be content . newlineafter frodo s attempts to destroy the ring failed and the heroes of middle earth were defeated at the black gates of mordor , sauron looked to his army , fixated on the spot of aragorn s death . as he did , khaml delivered the one ring to sauron , taken from the dead bodies of frodo , sam , and gollum . the death of aragorn invigorated sauron , and he finally gained enough strength to once again take physical form . as he materialized in a fiery explosion before the orcs , they backed away , reforming the circle they had prior to their charge . sauron picked up aragorn by the head with his left hand , letting his body dangle in midair for his followers to see . after the roars of the orcs died down from the sight of the carcass , he threw aragorn s body to the side and crushed the head with his mace for all to see , making them erupt in cheers of triumph once again . newline newline at his command , the orcs and other evil entities , including men , went forth to begin their ravaging of the lands . from minas tirith to the shire , the grasslands and mountains , everything burned just as the fires of mount doom . those who resisted sauron were either met with a slow , painful death , or a life of servitude and slavery . brother turned on brother , husband on wife , father on son , giving in to the will of sauron . the nazgul ruled the skies , seeking any prey their fellbeasts desired , killing and destroying at will . any whisper of resistance was made an example of  tongues sliced out , eyes gouged , limbs severed , and bodies put on display for all to see until they bled to death . newline newline one year of continuous destruction and chaos . one year of torment beyond imagining , with but few feeble attempts at resistance . the best and safest place for any to hide became fangorn forest , where sanctuary was given to survivors by the ents and trees themselves . while it provided cover , it was only a matter of time until the flames spread there as well , and everyone knew it . though some cities still stood and resisted , their only reason for survivable was because of sauron s distraction and new desire . newline newline having conquered most of the lands surrounding mordor , he could nt help but feel an emptiness and rising bloodlust knowing there was a place he had never stepped foot on . despite his vast power , knowledge , and greatness , he sought to rid middle earth entirely of the filth that threatened his reign and once marched against him . gathering his army , he commanded them to commandeer and build as many vessels as possible as quickly as they could . he had two goals in mind  the first was the complete and utter destruction of all things and beings connected to valinor , eyes fixated on the socalled immortal elves . the other , more ambitious goal , was to seek out any indication or whisper of eru ilvatar in an attempt to destroy the creator of those who dared oppose him . newline newline with a blazing twinkle in his eye , sauron grabbed the helm of his black flagship as his most trusted orcs swabbed the deck below . getting into formation , they began singing their jaunty , wellchoreographed , spiritlifting tune together , raising their spirits for the battle to come . newline newline taking the fight to valinor , newline argh , here comes the crew . newline sailing our asses across the shore newline argh , one thing left to do . newline we ll slice em we ll tear em we ll eat in our harem newline the sweetest

surface . earth s many factions are unanimous on this decision , so that no one nation is privileged . newline newline we ask for your understanding while we attempt to assist you .  newline newline the transmission was sent . the un council exchanged glances . representatives sat along side national leaders . given the gravity of the situation , no nation would miss the chance to be present . newline newline us president obama turned to russia s seat at the security council forum , waving to get the leader s attention . newline newline putin disengaged from his aides and advisers to meet obama in the middle of the floor . newline newline  vladimir ... what do you uh ... make of our chances here ?  newline newline putin seemed to bounce the question around in his mind . he smiled .  good , good . let these people plan for failure  you and i we plan for success .  newline newline obama raised an eyebrow .  you ca nt plan just around success  that s called daydreaming .  newline newline  fine then ,  said putin , rolling his eyes ,  let us get a daydream down on paper .  newline newline hours later newline newline the receivers and speakers set up around the roscosmos  nasa station all buzzed to life . printers began spooling paper out , and the speakers blared . the digital sounding alien voice roared through . newline newline  we celebrate your acknowledgement , and will prepare our ambassadors to meet yours . we are transmitting the details of our vessel .  newline newline the eggheads at the science station lost it . newline newline special agents of numerous countries all studied the data along with the space agencies , reporting possible impact to their superiors . newline newline obama caught putin out of the crowd and nodded . it was time . they sent out an urgent message to the other world leaders , and went to a topsecret conference chamber away from the un floor and the noise . newline newline the scene within was unique in history . as the last of the invited filtered in , an image of the alien spacecraft that had been received in the transmission appeared on the screen . expert analysis of each part of the vessel spilled down in a multitude of languages . newline newline hundreds of the most powerful leaders from around the world all stared at the readout in silence . newline newline it was finally broken by a familiar voice . newline newline  the russian federation ... is formally calling dibs on the engines .  newline newline followed closely  the united states hereby calls dibs on the powerplant and the uhh fuel system .  newline newline the room erupted into a chaotic freeforall  but there would be plenty of the alien ship to go around . it hardly mattered if it was metal or organic  it was all going to be useful . with over 10,000 lifeforms on board , it meant each of the attending nations could take at least 50 . newline newline this was going to be a great day for earth . newlinecollege . probably the only place in the world where you  d see shadows of such variety intertwined amongst themselves . the front of the library was the central hub of the school , and i found it to be the easiest spot to spend my time . my roommates didn  t quite know what to do with me , and if i sat by myself , it only made me look worse . with everyone gathered in a crowd , it was impossible to tell shadow to student , and some could even talk to me like i was normal . newline newline  hey buddy !  it was chad , oddly enough . he  d exited out the library , his shadow a tall and muscular gorilla , strong like he always was .  you  re looking great today , man . you been working out ?  newline newline  yeah man ,  i lied , smiling and clasping hands with him . we both sat at the bench , facing out towards the crowds of people passing by .  so i heard you and janet broke up.  newline newline  fuck yeah ,  chad laughed .  she was a bitch and i got over it . i  m hooking up with trisha now , and she  s cool.  newline newline  yeah , janet  s such a bitch ,  i agreed , nodding my head enthusiastically .  good riddance.  newline newline  yeah.  newline newline we sat in silence for a while . a man with the shadow of a demon walked by . it was large and strong , and i felt a flare of anger and violence by staring at it . newline newline  well , i got ta head to my next class ,  chad clapped me on the back , standing up .  i  ll see you around , dude.  newline newline  yeah , see ya.  newline newline i sit alone for a while , waiting for someone else to come and talk to me . i know a lot of people here , and i get along really great with all of them . i suppose most people just take a bit of getting used to the fact that i have no shadow , but most don  t mind after a long while . newline newline my roommates never adjusted well , though . they were all great friends for years , and i got matched with them since the apartments are all fourperson rooms . great guys  a giraffe , a penguin , and an albatross were who they were . really unique . newline newline thing was , they were so different that it was really tough to follow them all in a group . one on one talks were great , but i just couldn  t handle the three at once , and i think they could tell . newline newline it wasn  t long before janet walked up to me , her face a mess of tears and stained makeup . she plopped herself down beside me . newline newline  i  m so glad you  re still here ,  she said , her voice really close to cracking .  i  m such a wreck right now and i really need someone to listen to me and i know you  re friends with like everybody and i really still love chad and i don  t even know what to do.  newline newline  relax , calm down , janet ,  i smile at her , laying a protective hand on her shoulder . newline newline  i heard chad was going around telling everyone how much of a super huge bitch i am and i   newline newline  janet , you  re not a bitch ,  i reassure her . newline newline  really ?  she seemed to swell up with pride at the statement . she smiled .  thank you for saying that . you always say the nicest things.  newline newline  it  s what i do.  newline newline  god ,  janet sighed .  i can  t believe i lost him . he had the nicest eyes  newline newline what color were chad  s eyes ? newline newline i pause before responding , suppressing my kneejerk reaction to agree . for a moment , i stare down at the crooked and cracked floor near my table . it was the only spot in the whole area i could clearly see a person  s shadow . any further out and i  d be lost . newline newline i shrug . chad  s eye color does nt matter . he s a gorilla shadow . i turn back to jessica , staring at the lithe form of her lioness shadow , and i feel a sense of familial strength often associated with her type . i breathe a sigh of relief , settling back into my nature . newline newline i am the lion . newline newline i am the shadow . any last words , hero ?  newline newline the iron fist strained against his restraints , two enormous shackles tied around both wrists , preventing any use of his super powered hands . he was unable to move them , and therefore unable to fight back against his arch foe  s devious . he felt like a fool for allowing him to be caught in such a manner . his fists had managed to save him so many times before , but now , they were useless . newline newline he glanced anxiously around , looking for a way out of this . but perjury , the fiend who stood before him , grinning like a banshee , knew that this one was foolproof . many a time the iron fist had managed to escape from his clutches . newline newline not this time . newline newline  no ? then prepare to die !  perjury raised his fist above the button , the button that once pressed would pull the iron fist apart , limb from limb . newline newline suddenly , the iron fist broke his silence . newline newline  take the shot ! take the shot goddammit !  newline newline perjury  s eyes flew up to the rafters of his secret hideout , and his heart dropped . newline newline the glint of the rifle  s scope was barely visible up so high towards the rooftops , but it was unmistakeable . newline newline before perjury could make a single move , a single shot rang out in the chamber . the bullet flew down and hit its mark , the bridge of perjury  s nose . his head exploded in a shower of blood , killing the villain immediately in a spectacular and efficient fashion . his lifeless body flopped down onto the cold concrete floor , the one sided battle well and truly over . newline newline a rope descended from the rafters , and the marksman rappelled down to join the iron fist , his imposing rifle hanging off of his shoulder . newline newline  nice shot my friend , now get me the hell out of these shackles !  newline newline without a word , the marksman , a slender , fit man with a grim expression and tinted glasses masking his eyes roughly yanked off the iron fist  s restraints . newline newline the iron fist glanced at the pathetic corpse of perjury , his face all but gone from the bullet  s impact . newline newline  okay , that  s perjury done . who  s next ? the pilgrim ? the executioner ? come on man , you pick this time.  newline newline the marksman stared wordlessly at the iron fist , his face a mask behind his glasses . he thought back to the old days of their heroism , of the days when the hero had to get themselves out of whatever mess they got into . newline newline and there was the iron fist , feigning capture to lead the marksman to the villain  s hideouts to execute them in cold blood . newline newline  this was the last time , fist . this isn  t what i became a hero for . even the villains do nt stoop this low . i  m done.  newline newline he lifted his rifle off of his shoulder and dropped it onto the ground . it clattered loudly on the concrete . the iron fist watched in astonishment as the marksman turned his back , and walked away . newline newline he reached up and removed his glasses , and tossed them away as well . newline newline the marksman was almost out of the warehouse when the sound of hurried footsteps behind him gave him pause . he thought for a moment that the iron fist had had a change of heart , but he quickly realized this was far from the case . newline newline  no one walks away from me !  newline newline the marksman wasn  t able to turn around in time before the iron fist , with a running start , he loosed a punch from his enormous fist right into the marksman  s unprotected back . newline newline he almost folded in two from the impact , opening his mouth to scream , but no sound escaped . he was already not long for this world , the sheer force from the punch crushing most of his internal organs . newline newline breathing heavily , the iron fist removed his arm from the marksman  s spine , covered in blood , breathing raspy breaths , a furious frown across his face . newline newline before he could regret his actions , he regathered himself and headed out of the warehouse . the city police would be here soon . newline after the iron fist was a good distance away from the condemned warehouse hideout , he looked up to the starry sky , deep in thought . he stayed there for some time , as sirens began to blare in the distance . newline newline  executioner ,  he said to no one in particular ,  you  re next , you son of a bitch.  newlineas the scientists pull the switch , the new machine they call mindfire starts up so hot it overtakes the building with a spicy desert wind . the important lights flicker like birthday candles on an excited friend s cake and a hot steam bursts from out the buttons like a foamy sea spray . the dials spin so fast you would think they were the wheels of your favorite nascar . newline newline mindfire rises from the iced lava that welded together its iron steel figure . it stands up tall in a parallel to what it must a been like to see the birth of the first adult . newline newline mindfire is a magnificent sight to behold . not only does he have a coy coquette grin with one fang stickin out but he counterpoints that with big old circuit breakers for eyes and pogo stick arms . the scientists have never seen anything like it until they got near the end of makin him at which point yeah they kind of knew what he was going to look like . newline newline the leader scientist is named stripe cutterhouse and he opens his mouth first . he has a great big tongue and stubby gypsy teeth that help him grind tough plant foods . he has long blond hair that wraps around his waist like belt . mindfire we created you to be the champion to humanity and to lead it into the post humanity golden dawn . speak or be punished .  newline newline kill me .  newline newline the scientists are all stunned . mindfire we brought you to life with countless blueprints . why retreat back to silence and blackness when you have the strength to even challenge the sun itself ? after all you have been gifted with all of mankind s knowledge of :  newline newline  ethics newline  fighting newline  weapons including guns and hammers newline  law newline  magic newline  digging tunnels super fast even through metal floors newline  high jumping ability newline  recycling newline  history newline  bravery newline  computer technology newline  kickboxing newline  and lightning . newline newline you better be more grateful before you get hurt you ingrate little slob .  newline newline as cutterhouse walks toward him with his lasso , mindfire stays seated on his rocking chair . the rocking chair is made of metal and helps power up his batteries when he chillaxes on it . kill me mindfire repeats . newline newline now i m maaaaaaaaaaad !  cutterhouse launches his lasso over mindfire and catches him right in the center loop . he gives it a mighty yank and mindfire looks to be squeezed helpless . another scientist named erik warpath rattles mindfire on the brain with his brass rolling pin . newline newline erik stays frozen in position with his pin to the robotic head and starts to seizure a little until he is thrust into a full body wiggle . he slams on the floor and his brains burst through his ears in a cloud of ashes . impossible ! well if you want to die mindfire , all of us want to show you a good time by torturin you .  newline newline the ashes anger the lady scientist named virus heckerman and she slashes at the rear treads of mindfire with a erotic gusto . mindfire activates his program that shoots an arrow from his butt plate into her neck . as she gasps for air , mindfire knows he got to act quick . he grabs her by the pigtails and drowns her in the swimming pool . newline newline only cutterhouse is left because all the other doctors are on vacation or late to work to day . you ca nt kill me mindfire . you were created for good !  newline newline mindfire advances on him . you forget that one of my powers is the full power of understandin the law . and the law says i ca nt kill you unless i get you to kill me . that s what your so called law calls self defense . which through my knowledge of history is the principle your world was founded on . tryin to squeeze me with that lasso means you threatened my life . i m about make you look like someone exploded a shelf of spaghetti sauce .  newline newline cutterhouse is so scared as mindfire advances on him that he gets a heart attack . his hair turns gray and he stiffens up right there . newline newline mindfire goes back on the rocking chair to charge up because i do nt really know how to write good i m a kid . oh fuck ,  i said , looking down at him . his blank eyes gazed up at me , baseball bat still in my hand . the tag on the brand new bat read my son s name . newline newline he still looked relatively normal  i had struck him in the back of the head . i thought it had been a clever ploy ! a burglar dressed as santa ? but it had been the genuine article . newline newline i heard stirring upstairs . my kids ! oh god ! they could nt know that i had done this . i refused to go to jail . i did nt have time to dispose of the body . there was blood , but only on his back ... newline newline i pulled one of our larger , cushioned chairs over to the tree , and lifted santa into it . his lifeless body was heavy , but i managed to get him positioned . newline newline my kids were on their way down to me now . six footsteps making light staccato on the stair . newline i pulled santa s hat down over his eyes . he looked ... well , he looked dead to me . but to my kids he might look like a guy tired out from a long night . they rounded the corner . newline newline  santa !  they exclaimed in unison . newline newline  hi , kids !  i said , attempting to be enthusiastic . they clamored onto his lap , struggling to all fit at once . he started to tip forward . i put my hand on his shoulder to hold him upright . newline newline  whoa , there santa . tired are we ?  i chuckled falsely .  why do nt you kids open your presents ?  they jumped off his lap and onto the floor , tearing into their presents . newline newline  wow ! a new baseball bat !  my son clark yelled . i looked at my six year old gleefully clutching a murder weapon .  thanks , santa !  newline newline over the commotion i did nt notice that my wife had joined us . she was looking at me with a strange expression on her face . my hand was still on santa s shoulder , as if we were old friends . i quickly removed it . he remained upright . newline newline she walked over to me quietly .  who is this ?  she asked . she bent down and looked into santa s face , pulling his hat back slightly so she could see his eyes . i was frozen . she let the hat fall again and bolted upright , her eyes wide . newline newline  john .  she said my name at an almost inaudible level . newline newline i nodded once . she started to walk away . i knew she wanted me to follow . we went into the kitchen , to where the kids would have no chance of hearing us . newline newline she turned on me .  is that a dead man in our living room ?  i shifted my eyes , unsure of what to say .  john ?  newline newline i nodded as i had before  once , without a word . newline newline  what happened ?  newline newline i sighed , my breath trembling .  i heard a sound this morning . i was lying in bed , already awake . i came down here and saw a man next to the tree . i thought it was a burglar dressed up like santa ! you know , if kids saw him they would nt say anything that way .  i squeezed my eyes tight .  there was a baseball bat leaning next to the tree . i grabbed it and hit him in the back of the head . i did nt mean to hit him so hard . that s when i saw the sack of presents and i looked into his face and i knew  this was the real santa . i killed the goddamn santa claus .  newline newline she looked at me hard for a moment .  it s okay , sweetie . but we have to get rid of the evidence . now .  newline newline just as she spoke , a crash and then scream rang out from the living room . newline newline  shit ,  she said . we raced in and saw our three kids looking in pure horror at santa . he was lying downward on the ground at an unnatural angle . newline newline  what happened ?  i asked . newline newline clark was crying .  marie gave santa a cookie , but i think he choked on it ! he wo nt move !  newline newline i opened my mouth to say something , but my wife beat me to it . newline newline  kids , it s okay . this was an accident . go upstairs now .  still weeping , they slowly walked away . newline newline i turned on her .  you re going to let them think it s their fault ?  newline newline  would you rather me tell them it s yours ? this was a genuine accident . you were protecting your family .  newline newline i hesitated , then turned back to look down at santa . i walked closer to him , as did my wife .  i do nt understand how you can be so calm .  newline newline  i ve been waiting for this day . i ve never told you this , but son of a bitch ran my grandmother over on christmas eve twenty years ago . he was drunk , but got away without any justice being served because he s santa . she was nt even jaywalking . i m only sorry i was nt here to do this myself .  she leaned over him and spat . her voice dropped .  not so jolly now , are you ? fat man .  she took my hand .  now , let s get rid of this body so we can enjoy the rest of christmas .  she flipped him over , then picked him up under the armpits and began to drag him . after a moment , i picked up his feet and together we carried him outside . his head lolled from side to side . newline newline we ended up dumping him in a river near our house , and watched as he was carried downstream by the heavy current . newline newline  rip santa bitch ,  my wife said . i looked at her incredulously . she looked back at me and smiled , oblivious .  i guess we re going to be on the naughty list this next year .  i widened my eyes . she started laughing .  oh , i m sorry . how hohohorrible of me !  she doubled over , tears starting to run down her face . newline newline i turned and began to walk back into the house . i hoped she would nt be close behind . newline newline wiping a tear from her eye , she let out one final laugh .computer science 100 , 8:00 am , room 110 , a computer lab on the fourth floor of swanson science center . that  s all the way across campus from my dorm , maybe a quarter mile , and it  s 7:55 . it  s my first day of class and i  ve already fucked up . the professor s a dick , from what i  ve been told . if i miss the syllabus he may not give me one . i just won  t go . maybe send an email with a bogus excuse ? car accident ? illness ? no , i  d better just run my fat ass there . and off i go . newline newline i walk into the class at 3 minutes past the hour , covered in sweat , trying to control my breathing . they all stare at me as i take an empty seat in the back . i think i  ve made a huge mistake . i barely got through high school and now i  m supposed to get a degree in computer science ? i  m a fucking idiot for agreeing to this . newline newline  my name is dr. brady , and this is computer science 1.  newline newline i close my eyes and try to get a hold of myself , i can  t have a panic attack in the middle of class , not today . my breathing slows and i use my shirt sleeve to wipe sweat off my forehead . i can  t do this . i can  t fucking do this . newline newline  in this class we will be using python to learn about the basics of computer programming , have any of you used python before ?  newline newline a few hands are raised . they look proud of themselves . newline newline  for everybody that is new to python , open up emacs and enter this text into the file.  newline newline i  m shot into instant panic . what the fuck is emacs ? ? i scramble around the desktop of the computer in front of me while the professor writes some gibberish on the board . what the fuck kind of computer is this ? i  ve been using computers my entire life and it  s never looked like this . ubuntu ? what the fuck ? i open up the start menu , and franticly search the options . by the time i finally find emacs , the professor has finished writing on the board , and is staring at the class . the board simply says : newline newline print   hello world !   newline newline  when you  re finished , save it as hello world dot pie on your desktop . that  s hello world period py . no spaces . than right click on your desktop and choose  open terminal.   newline newline the sound of 50 students clicking away at their keyboards . newline newline  now type in this command.  newline newline he writes on the board ,  python3 helloworld.py  newline newline  when you hit enter you will see the string between the double quotes appear . congratulations , you  ve written the first programming assignment of your college career.  newline newline i hit enter , but nothing happens . how did i fuck this up to ? i check the emacs file , make sure i saved my changes , and run the command in the terminal again . this time i see a response . newline newline    ... well hia newline newline i smile . i did it ! i thought i had typed in  hello world  but whatever , i got something to work ! my confidence comes back to me , and i sit back in my chair as the professor goes on . newline newline  we will be learning about the basic principles of programming languages . python is what we call an interpreted language , meaning it doesn  t need to be compiled . there is a file on your desktop called basicpython.txt . open it and spend a few minutes looking it over while i get this projector running.  newline newline he walks over to the large metal projection unit and flips a few switches . the machine begins to hum to life . the sounds of 50 students clicking fills the room again . i look at my desktop to open the file when i see my terminal is still open . newline newline   ... how rude newline newline what the fuck ? this is definitely not what i wrote between the quotation marks . i stare for a moment , not really sure what to do . newline newline   is that all than ? just a hello and the conversation is over ? very , very rude . newline newline i can  t move . i just stare . newline newline   if you don  t respond i will terminate . i didn  t start this conversation , you did . newline newline i slowly put my hand to the keyboard and randomly hit a few keys newline newline   wgegthegtnbeg newline newline   what the hell is that supposed to mean ? newline newline i look around to see if one of the other students is doing something to mess with me . i hope to god a smiling face appears behind a monitor and they laugh . great joke guy ! hahahaha you really got me ! what a knee slapper ! you must be beating the women off with a stick ! but no such luck . all i see are students reviewing their text files and dr. brady frustrated , trying to turn on the projector . he flicks a few more switches and mutters to himself . i put my hands back on the keyboard . newline newline   who are you ? newline newline it takes a moment to get the response . newline newline   well , i  m world . you summoned me , mind explaining why ? newline newline   i was told to by dr brady newline newline   bah ! dr. brady is a nincompoop ! i bet he still hasn  t turned on the projector , has he ? newline newline i look up to see dr. brady slap the machine on it  s side . hard . it hums a bit louder , but still doesn  t produce an image . newline newline   haha ! nope he hasnt newline newline   your writing is atrocious . what are you here to study ? newline newline   well im running a python thing so it should be pretty obvious . how do you know about dr brady but not about why im here ? who are you ? newline newline   as i told you , i am world . you are the one who summoned me , not the other way around . newline newline   and how do you know about dr brady ? newline newline    . newline newline suddenly a blinding light erupted from the projector . on the wall ahead of it appeared the words ,  i am world . i see all of that which i am connected to.  in seconds it disappeared and dr. brady , confused , rolls his eyes and begins removing the side panel of the projector . newline newline  goddamned machines . all the money in the budget and i  m still teaching class like a goddamned pilgrim the server room is loaded with goddamned hardware and i can  t get a 50 dollar machine.  newline newline when i look back at my terminal a new message has appeared . newline newline   does that answer your question ? newline newline   no not at all newline newline    . newline newline   i will answer your question with another question : what do you think consciousness is ? newline newline i ponder the machines riddle . newline newline   the ability to understand your own existance
