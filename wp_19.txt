, watching a younger woman strip in front of him . a prostitute no doubt . i inhaled slowly , and exhaled . the air was brisk , atleast 30 degrees fahrenheit . i so small flakes of snow , float peacefully in front of me . i found the room , i was looking for . ive been tracking this man for 2 weeks . man was he elusive . the lights flickered on . the red haired man , was mildly attractive , i can see the appeal women had for him . i followed him into the next room , with my sights . the lights flickered on , i was taken aback by the scene . a man , overweight and balding . was strapped to a table , with ... .is that plastic wrap ? i regained my composure and found the contract . he was wearing a butchers apron now . he raised a knife , and slammed it into the older man s heart . he looked up into the ceiling , orgasmic . newline  what in the hell ...  i whispered to myself . i inhaled deeply as i put my finger on the trigger . he began to slowly come down from his rush , as he

hall at a brisk pace , straightening her blazer as she hurried toward one of the villagers  house . wolfgang , one of the other residents , had brought it to her attention that his neighbor had not been seen since yesterday , which in such a tight knit community was cause for alarm . isabelle s heart stuttered uncomfortably , but she reassured herself that it was most likely just a case of the sniffles . newline newline with a nod to decorum , she knocked politely as she called out ,  kat ? kat , are you there ? it s isabelle , wolfgang told me that you ve not been out , i wanted to check

newline newline  i m not sure what happened , please do nt panic , i m completely okay isabelle , i need you to just not freak out , okay ?  a voice blurted all of that out in the span of a few seconds , the speaker clearly worried themself . isabelle sighed in relief , at least kat was still there . newline newline  i have no idea what you re talking about , where are you , it s so dark in here ,  isabelle said idly as her paw felt the wall for the light switch . she flicked it on , and turned back to the room , only to gasp with shock and horror . newline newline kat , who had been a

furniture as she went . newline newline isabelle s mind raced . there had to be some explanation , something to reason this out . there would be time for that later though , first she needed to figure out how to explain to the other villagers what had happened . would she say kat had moved away and this was someone new ? they d need a reason , and a new house , not to mention permits ... well the mayor s position was open and isabelle already did all the work from when tortimer was mayor . it would nt take much to convince the villagers they were getting a new mayor . she just had to hope that the transformation would stick , and everything would work out just fine . newline newline  i based it off of the video game animal crossing . i saw the prompt and that s what i thought of . not sure

with the idiots in politics he d played the game to shoot morons , and only the way he became the best in the world , but it was nt enough , there was something missing . newline newline  boom ! headshot you fucking faggot !  newline newline trashtalk . he d obviously been unable to trashtalk over the mic before , but now , with nondisclosure forms and security , he was free to spew shit . whilst he was good at the game , he was obviously out of practice in the insult department . newline newline  good motherfucking night house !  newline newline that one was actually pretty good . a few laughs went up around the room , as the president laughed at us from his little bulletproof box . newline newline i sat , and i watched . my moment was coming . newline newline he was earning his

fitting . newline newline  an asteroid , mr. president  newline newline i pulled the trigger . no .  newline newline  okay , then you re fired .  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  i said youre  newline newline  i heard what you , said , and that s bull shit ! you ca nt fire me .  newline newline  i can if you do nt say yes to this .  bill sighed heavily . shit , i d be making noises like that too if i had to do his job for 20 years . bill was our liaison to a lot of the big name villains . he had the right connections and the villains would talk to him . newline newline  look , professor doom just wants to talk to you for a bit . he asked for you by name , dan . by name . doom does nt even know his lieutenants names . and besides , this is beneficial for us .  newline newline  well it s nice to know youre getting something out of it .  newline newline  hey , do nt be a smartass about this . doom s lair was scheduled to fall to james blond a month ago . instead , we have nt heard about the guy since he made the attempt .  he sighed again . newline newline  i should nt have to tell you repeat business is our life s blood , dan . word gets out we ve been double dealing , it s over , for all of us .  i was just an architect , i did nt understand all the business aspects behind what we did . but i did know we took money from the league of heroes to install ways into their bases . our little way of giving back to the community . jesus , if doom s found out about that , we re dead . and the fact that he wanted to see me ? the architect ? not a good sign . but if i did nt go , we d just look guilty . newline newline  so will you do it ?  newline newline  yeah ... fine . i ll do it .  newline newline  great ! i knew i could count on you . so ... do nt die , and if you can , find out what happened to to james .  newline newline i arrived at the airport , turns out doom was flying me out on a private jet . why did they always try to impress us ? we get it , they re big and powerful people . cool it ... newline newline i must have been on my third glass of wine when we touched down . i told myself that it d help me relax , not be nervous . it was a damn lie , but it was a comforting lie . i was met by clarence and darcy , doom s heads of research and security respectively . i remember having to deal with both of them extensively when i was building the labs . darcy always wanted more security , clarence always wanted more ease of access . the whole thing had been a massive headache . newline newline  the professor will see you immediately . follow me please .  straight to the point . no bull shit . you stay you , darcy . newline newline doom was on the observation deck , looking down at the floor below . schemes , plots ,

what was it you wanted to see me about ?  newline newline  you know ... dan ...  there s that dramatic turn .  darcy said it was a mistake hiring your people to build the base . but it turns out we picked the best people in the business ! i ve even finally caught james blond , and oh , the things he s been telling me ...  newline newline fuck ... newline newline  he claims that you re people had sabotaged the place , leaving an opening in the security . a drainage pipe leading out to the ocean , guarded only by a metal grate ...  the whole time he d been speaking he was getting closer . by now i was nt sure if i was being interrogated or if he was making a move . either way i was suppressing the screams coming from my brain to run and hide and cower under something . newline newline  in fact , if it had nt been for the secondary contractor , i might have missed it completely . and you ... you would have fooled me . do you take me for a fool , dan ?  oh , god , he actually wanted an answer . think of something you dumb bastard , before he shoots you with a death ray or something . newline newline  i take you for a man , a great man , maybe , but even great men are not invincible . anyone can be brought down if you re cunning enough .  he stepped back , i felt like for the first time he was actually looking at me , observing me . newline newline  how would you like to come work for me . we could use someone like you . someone who s tricked so many of my ... associates , in the past .  newline newline  i ... i have a noncompete  newline newline  oh , let the lawyers babble , meanwhile you ll be doing great things for me , and making some money in the process . real money . not whatever piss poor pay your outfit gives you .  i had to admit , the pay was piss poor . wait , what was i thinking , this was a terrible idea ! newline newline  and what s to stop you from just killing me when you re done with me ?  newline newline  keep doing good work , dan , and the thought will scarce enter my mind .  i could nt believe i said yes to this ... newline newline  i ca nt believe i m saying yes to this ...  newline newline  funny , clarence said the same thing when he first started , and look at him now . i think he might actually be ready to start his first plot all on his own ...  i will never forget hearing a super villain choke up like that . newline newline  are you ... crying ?  newline newline  they grow up so fast ...  well ... at least this would prove interesting ... okay , i m ready ,  you say . newline newline you re thrilled . 15 years you ve

the button is lit . it should have worked . newline newline you nudge one of the hundreds of sensors glued to your head . nope , still there . newline newline you move your hands in front of your eyes . yes , still in your body . newline newline you snap your fingers . the click is loud in the silence , but there is no echo . newline newline everything is frozen . newline newline you hear something

imagine it ? newline newline a second voice , slightly softer , asks ,  what is it ?  newline newline  we got an emulator in 37 . the whole thing is locked up .  newline newline you look around . but

they arrived there , they found the commander at the centre of the room behind a table  his expression grim and less than friendly . newline newline  heil spellcheck !  , the commander barked once the door closed behind the gathering . the officers followed suit , stomping their right foot while raising their hand up and forward . the room echoed with the collective chant of the officers . newline newline  we have a spy among us .  , the commander said when silence fell . this was old news , most of the officers thought . throughout the rule of the nazi party , there had always been spies from rogue countries , but they never survived long . the weekly participlecheck challenges always gave them away . they could nt keep up as well as the grammar nazis . no one could , except the nazis themselves . so why did the commander seem more fazed than usual ?  newline newline  he is one of us . he might have fooled our participlecheck challenge but when i went through yesterday s adverb reports , i noticed one candidate s report showing a recurring use of one adverb in particular .  newline newline the air in the crowd seemed to tighten as the commander lowered his voice until it turned into an almost inaudible whisper .  he is a literally  abuser !  newline newline the gathering in front of him let out a collective gasp . newline newline how could it be , thought the officers . they had been exterminated in the conjunction camps long ago .  newline newline the officers shifted uneasily as they stood facing the commander . is he here in this room ? is he standing next to me ?  newline newline  officer shey , please step forward and have a seat  , said the commander , gesturing towards a wooden chair beside him . newline newline as a lean faced man broke off from the group and sat down shaking , the commander directed his menacing voice now to the frightened man instead .  i have a few questions of my own devising , to ask you , if you do nt mind . you should have no problem answering them correctly if you are truly , a grammer nazi at heart .  newline newline officer shey looked mortified as he looked at the officers silently watching him . he shifted his gaze back up to the commander and swallowed . newline newline the commander s face showed a light smile as he asked ,  in your own defence , would you say that you are figuratively innocent ?  newline newline officer shey looked weedy , but his response was stern .  no , of course not . i am literally innocent .  newline newline some officers gasped again , and some hung their head as the commander s smile turned into a grin . newline newline officer shey seemed surprised at this .  what ? what s wrong ? in terms of grammar , that sentence is literally correct !  newline newline the officers were now shaking their heads as they could nt believe what was happening .  how could you do this ?  , one of them called out . newline newline the guards behind the commander began to approach officer shey , but the commander raised one hand without turning around to stop them , and raised a taser out his pocket slowly with his other hand . newline newline  i have one last question for you . we already know who the culprit is . his name is two . does that mean anything to you ?  newline newline  ttwo ?  , officer shey faltered .  two who ?  newline newline the commander brought the taser down sharply to officer shey s side and in a moment , officer shey lay on the ground , twitching and writhing in apparent agony . newline newline the command bent down and brought his face next to the still twitching officer s face and whispered in his characteristic , almost inaudible manner .  it s to whom , officer two shey . the hall was lined with marble statues along either side of the red and dusty rug . worn plaques lay beneath each figure , justifying their presence : newline newline krall the destroyer , fierce in both physique and expression , holding his warhammer widowmaker . mothers told their children to go to bed lest krall come to get you . newline newline vyncent the unconquerable , lord of the seven and servant to none . legend had it he had killed two kings in a single battle  that of the invading army s , and as gesture that he bowed to no man  his own . newline newline damian rainbringer : usurper , tyrant . murderer , savior . stories of the rainbringer were as numerous as their disbelievers . newline newline these were the rare displays , unique in their completeness . others were broken , missing limbs or heads or , worst of all , reason . the mighty warriors of old , destroyer of kingdoms , leaders of men : collectors of dust . newline newline the hall is quiet save for the cavernous echoes of rain dripping through cracked ceiling . no man stands to gaze upon the ruins the statues have become , for no man knows the hall exists , long lost to the cruelest conqueror of all : time . newline newline yet here it can be found in broken walls and puddled floors and sunlit corners . nurturing and growing . the meekest , but most tenacious , of all . timid , fragile , enduring life . victor ! victor you d better see this !  newline newline the astronaut , hearing his name , bounded across the red landscape . he had been sent to search mars for life and possibility of colinization two months ago , and by now the excitement had faded , replaced by a longing for home , for company other than lola . newline newline  yes lola ?  in responce , lola said not a word but held up a strange rock . it was smoothened , like a fractured dome or broken plate . on it were strange etchings , running in vertical ribbons of indecipherable scrawl . it was the same red shade as the rest if the arid planet , but possessed a simple sleekness absent from the rest of the wasteland . newline newline  that s incrediable lola ! you do nt suppose ...  newline newline  i do ! there s no other possibility , victor !  newline newline  lola , let s wait

muttered to homself , grabbing lola s life support line in one hand and his blade in the other .  together ...  not set in modern times  it s wwiera  newline newline we could hear the clanking sound of the german panzers approaching long before we could hear them . drums and battlecries echoed over the rolling hills of ypres , and plumes of smoke drifted into the sky beyond the tree line . this was the most unsettling part : the waiting . knowing that they were coming for you . i tried to light up a cigarette to calm my nerves , but my hands were shaking so hard that i could barely hold the lighter . newline newline armored figures , clad all in black metal , stomped out of the mists and through the grass toward our trenches . horns claxoned and men rushed to and fro in the trenches . i gripped the trigger of my repeating crossbow while my partner loaded stacks of bolts into the ammo compartment .  loose !  my officer shouted through the radio . a serene calm came over me  it was like going into a trance where my mind was disconnected from my body . i squeezed the trigger and pumped the handle , pouring thick black arrows into the german lines as quickly as i could . i saw some of them stagger and fall as the bolts pierced even their heavy steel armor . others just shrugged it off and kept approaching . the oil inside the arrows erupted in flames upon impact , spreading over the german soldiers . from behind , the massive trebuchets lobbed containers of mustard gas into the air , sending them crashing through the approaching masses in puffs of yellow smoke , mingling with the morning mist . in the trenches , the men donned their gas masks  i nodded to my partner and we stopped firing long enough to put on our own . screams drifted across the field as the germans choked to death . newline newline the armored division had reached the front lines . many were tangled in nets and barbed wire , and they were quickly dispatched by a wellaimed crossbow bolt . about 60 meters down , a group of panzers had broken through , drawing their short , stout swords and carving their way down the trench . the men were wielding their electric flails , bringing them down on the thick metal armor and frying the germans inside . others used large wooden punting poles with wide prongs on the end to push the soldiers back . the sounds of crackling sparks and the smell of burning flesh permeated the battlefield , even back to my pillbox . newline newline above , a massive zeppelin blotted out the sun , proudly flying the french tricolor . wires dangled from the belly of the beast , and the electric current running through them made my hair stand on end , even meters away . it flew slowly over the battlefield , back and forth like a comb , electrocuting large swaths of germans . a hail of arrows and ballista bolts pierced the wooden shields on the blimp s underside , but did not penetrate deep enough to puncture the air pockets . newline newline my compatriots and i cheered and continued firing as the germans began to retreat back into the forest . the artillery continued to lob poison cannisters after them , but they were out of crossbow range . finally , the fields were still , littered with the armored corpses . but the wounded from both sides continued to moan and cry in pain . above , the zeppelin speakers played  la marseillaise  in triumph . but in the back of our minds , we knew that the germans would be back , and that the war would never end . war ... is hell .author s note : auras . personally , i hate the idea of auras . it s a copout , a lazy device that reduces story complexity more than it enhances , and it s way overused on this subreddit . but because i m feeling pissed off at myself , i m going to try writing it anyway .  newline newline i heard the sound of my mom s footsteps on the stairs . she always acted astounded when i knew that it was her , before she even knocked on my bedroom door . i did nt know if she truly did nt understand that her footsteps on the creaky old wooden stairs of our family house sounded different , or if she just chose to humor me . newline newline  james ?  she called out , rapping her knuckles lightly against the other side of my bedroom door .  listen , are you awake ?  newline newline i groaned , grabbing my pillow and squeezing it tighter against my face . i let out an indistinct grunt , hoping she d take this as assent . newline newline  james ? do i need to come in there ? i know you re feeling under the weather , but do you need to go to the hospital ?  newline newline  no ! no , i do nt need to go to the hospital !  i yelped out , shooting upright in bed in panic . a hospital , with so much noise , so many people all around me , doctors poking at me and asking all sorts of questions ... it was just what i did nt need .  i m awake ! i m just feeling drowsy , that s all .  newline newline  okay , well , try and get some rest ,  my mom said after a beat .  and grandma is going to be over in a few minutes , to watch you for tonight . she ll be able to help out if you feel any worse .  newline newline i groaned again , although this was more out of normal teenage angst than illness .  mom , i m sixteen ! i m old enough to watch myself ! grandma does nt need to come over .  newline newline  not when you re sick ,  my mother insisted firmly . i heard the note of iron in her voice , knew that i would nt change her mind .  now just lay back and try to get some rest . hopefully , you ll feel better when your father and i get back tomorrow night .  newline newline i looked up at the door , watching as she left . newline newline i d always been able to tell when my mom came upstairs to check on me . my ears always caught the squeaking of the floorboards on the rickety staircase , differentiated my mom s lighter step from the heavy tread of my dad . i d mastered that trick by the time i turned seven . newline newline but only in the last couple days had i been able to see her glowing outline on the other side of the door ... with it still closed . newline newline as i heard her descend back down , her indistinct voice talking to my father , i once again flopped back and pressed my pillow against my face . what the hell was wrong with me ? why was my brain going crazy ? newline newline i knew that i was nt insane . pretty sure . i d taken my temperature , checked all my symptoms , even looked myself up on the internet , sneaking into the computer room after my dad finally fell asleep in front of the television on the couch . aside from the weird visions , everything else about me was still totally normal . james hawking , age sixteen , solid b student , on the junior varsity soccer team . brown hair , hazel eyes , unremarkable . newline newline but now , apparently able to see auras around people . newline newline i found the name on some hippydippy web forum . apparently , some people claimed that , through shamanistic meditation , they could train themselves to see these auras , determine whether people were good or evil . far more people claimed that the whole idea was bunk , that there was no such thing as an aura . newline newline well , i had nt been doing any meditating . the only thing that happened to me in the last few days was that , while diving for the soccer ball at the same time as jerry , the team captain , i twisted my ankle and ended up smacking my forehead right into the turf . newline newline i d felt ill the rest of the day , had managed to convince coach to let me go home early and sleep it off . i kept seeing weird glows around people , and worried that i might have a concussion . newline newline but the next morning , the glows had nt gone away . in fact , they d become more distinct , better defined . newline newline and it did nt take me long to figure out what they meant . newline newline that s right . it s not just a head injury that i m sporting , but it apparently matches up with whether a person is good or evil ! i figured this out , like most things , from watching television . my dad insisted on putting on the news , and i stared , openmouthed , as a couple of lawyers outlined in white hauled a man in an orange jumpsuit and a dark gray , almost black aura up the steps . newline newline  totally innocent ,  my dad declared , watching on the couch next to me .  they ve got the wrong guy .  newline newline  i do nt think so ,  i said slowly , staring at the pulsing , dark aura .  i think he did it .  newline newline thank heaven it was a

to being normal ! that s all that i want ! newline newline  james ? are you up there ? how are you , dear ?  newline newline that was the voice of my grandmother , my mom s mother .  i m up here , grandma ,  i called out , raising my voice to project through the door . she must still be downstairs , since i could nt see an aura . newline newline grandma higgins had always lived a couple streets down from us . i remembered watching cartoons with her when i was younger , despairing as i tried to explain the intricacies of spongebob to her . she d always been a warm , plump , smiling figure in

newline i considered pretending that i had nt heard her , but decided at length that i could nt stay in my room forever . besides , maybe i could get on the computer and do some more research . so i climbed up , stretched out my sore limbs , and headed downstairs . newline newline grandma higgins waited for me at the bottom of the stairs , smiling up at me between pink cheeks .  there s my boy !  she exclaimed , beaming at me .  now come down here !  newline newline but i could nt move . frozen on the landing , halfway down the stairs , i just stared at my grandmother . newline newline or , more specifically , i stared at the pure black aura that hung around her , pulsing with inky , evil malevolence . newlinewhen love burnt out , newline cities burned away . newline a horizon of light

a group of young boys , a pair of adventurous sisters and an old man . we had set out , to make something better than what we came from . they left behind lordships and wealth , lands and fame . they would have been kings to their peoples , and , in the case of one boy , the actual king of england . but they gave it all up , all the hollow titles , to build something new . newline newline i still remember that dream . the dream of a kingdom where all reeds and colours were equal . a kingdom where the weak did nt cower before the strong . a kingdom where wizardry was nt parlour tricks or a perversion of a great art . the kingdom england used to be . newline newline so they set out . we travelled with me , far and wide . we searched for some place we could call home . eventually we found it , though by this point i could nt really consider my companions children anymore . but we found that place to make our own . a place to come out from under the boot of oppression . we named it avalon , and in that land we founded a city . camelot . newline newline for the longest time , it seemed we had finally reached our goal . we had our city , our safe lands , and with the promise of a future , the people followed . one by one , peasants praised our young king , arthur . but as they say , or will say , all good things come to an end . newline newline so here i am , trapped in a hole . and the end is nearly upon us . i look up to my captor , her beautiful ivory hair dancing through the air as her hands twist to control the spell , an incantation rolling from her pink lips . she s still beautiful . no matter what she does . newline newline  vivian , listen !  i shout to her from my prison of green crystal and ancient stone .  it s not too late vivian . if you stop now i can get free . i can save camelot !  i ve been telling her all afternoon . she knows that , without me , arthur will fall to mordred and camelot will fall with him . she locks eyes with me , if only for a moment . her hair drifts around her face as she twists both her hands in a slow , deliberate circle . above me , there is a jarring sound , the deafening screech of stone giving way . a moment later , all the light in the world went out . i m trapped now . until this stone is broken and moved or until the world is devoured by time . newline newline the end is upon us . the end of camelot . the end of avalon . the end of all we worked for . but in the darkness i manage a weak smile . hidden in my robes is a tome , a collection of all our adventures . a boy and an old man . a story to teach to respect those different to themselves . teach them honour and kindness . a reminder that sometimes the good guys do nt win . but also , that evil never does . i know that morgana and mordred will fall with arthur . i know this land will remained untouched for centuries to come . but i also know that morgana s hate will die with her . and arthur s kindness will live on . now , i must just wait . then , i ll find a publisher . newline breakfast !  i heard a call from downstairs . i fussed under the covers for a bit , willing myself against my tired morning state to sit up . i peered around the room , my soft white curtains flowing with the breeze from the opened window . newline i propped myself up on my elbows finally , reaching to pull my hair back in a ponyta newline wha newline where the hell is all my hair ? newline i screamed . but wait , this voice is nt familiar . i stared around the room in a complete daze before settling my gaze upon something standing up between my legs . newline oh my god .  i m a boy ! when did that happen ? ! newline disturbed , i hopped out of my bed and concealed my ... my penis ... in my waist band so it would nt freak anybody else out . newline i hustled downstairs , warmly greeted my the blissful aroma of morning waffles , distracting me if only for a moment from the perplexing situation i woke up to . newline  mom ?  my low voice shocked me again . please let this all be a dream .  newline  gmorning nathan ! i made your favorite ! okay , well i just toasted some eggo s , but yknow . here you go .  newline my mom s even acting like this is totally normal ... is this my life now ?  newline i stared at my waffles , blinking back bewildered tears , cascading fresh maple syrup over my breakfast as i submitted to this weird alternate universe . newline newline edit :  sorry , i kinda skimmed the title and did it wrong . good day mr . mynth .  newline newline newline  hello .  newline newline newline  welcome to hell . you will notice that you have not been provided anything except a seat , in the middle of a body of water . i understand you have quite a fear of water , or rather , drowning , specifically .  newline newline newline  ... yes ... is that the only way out ?  newline newline newline  no , if you would like , i can play a movie . it goes on for eternity , but perhaps it is worse than drowning .  newline newline newline  what is the movie about ? ...  newline newline newline  well , it s not a motion picture on your life , nor about your worst fears . no , what i will show you , if you choose this path , is simply what could have been , every eventuality , every outcome that you would have wanted . ever possibility of the life you wanted , that you could have made , the choices that you missed or the feelings that you wanted to feel . the faces that you miss and the people that care for , all here , will be displayed . every moment of regret reversed , and every bad decision take back . this movie , will show you what you could have been .  newline newline newline  ... what choice do i have ? ...  newline newline newline  you can choose to die for the rest of eternity , in which you will die , but remain undead . or you can watch these moments for the rest of your life . the choice is yours . i will unbind you from the chair , so that you may amend this choice when you feel that one choice is better than the other . goodbye .  newline newline newline  but ...  newline newline newline he was gone . and the movie started . i looked at the water and shivered . then i looked at the screen , and saw my exwife . happy . with a sober , nonalcoholic me . i was healthy , happy , wealthy ... newline newline newline i looked at the water again ... newline newline newline the choice is mine ... it wasn  t noticeable at first . autocorrect mistakes happen to everyone . a few more  thank dog  s or  can you get some cock from the store  instead of coke . silly , harmless things . everyone knew that relaying too much on technology would be awful for communication . more breakups were blamed on online dating and the delayed adulthood of this generation . no one believed in the sanctity of marriage anymore either so of course the divorce rate would go up . then friendships started to crack . you can only stand so much  lol damn you autocorrect  until you start second guessing that they really did mean to say  see you later dick  instead of dude . yelling matches on the phones in restaurants and on the streets became a common occurrence . still people didn  t catch on . it  s makes much more sense that someone is an asshole instead of something . newline newline satan laughed from his throne . you can only damn something so much before he takes notice . giving sentience to the little guy was his best move since losing that art school acceptance letter in the mail . newlineday 1 . i ve spent the last few years training for today . i did so much yet it felt like it flew by . i already have my first two kills ! the strength i trained so hard for , the adrenaline in the moment , the sounds of the struggle , the silence of death . it s unlike anything i d felt before . my old life seems so mediocre in comparison . newline newline day 167 . i have nt written much in lpthe last few days , and i m not sure why i feel the need to do so today since it s just gon na be burned . i peers are acting strange . i think they know i killed my superior , colonel koller . yesterday we raided the city in the valley . as we approached the two of us broke off to flank when we found an enemy soldier with a whore , or his wife , i m not sure . you should have seen what i did to them . koller tried to stop me . he told me i went to far and tried to subdue me . he deserved what he got . there s no such thing as too far in war . but , i m glad he did what he did . he showed me pure pleasure . i could feel his pulse weaken on my hand and the look on his face will forever be in my dreams . it must be those who trust me that give me true satisfaction . so i m finally doing it . with my knowledge of the base i m gon na kill everyone here then burn it all down . i ca nt wait until i m free to do anything i want , with no ties to anything .it was bound to happen . i mean , just statistically . newline newline i woke up today , and there was an inexplicably familiar flurry of thoughts and memories in my head . i did nt notice it at first . nobody wakes up and goes  what a wonderful morning ! time to check my memories to see if they re consistent and i do nt have amnesia !  you just assume it s another ordinary morning . newline newline but then , i tried to remember what i did last night , and the day i reconstructed was unseemly . it did nt seem to fit . newline newline i kept going about my day , but i kept thinking about it . the more i thought about it , the deeper i digged into the swirling enigma of what should have been a simple practice of recall , the stranger things appeared . newline newline before the day ended , i managed to piece together what was happening to me , hopping from life to life with barely a breath in my initial one , one i can no longer recall . each time i hop into another world to explore , eventually , they make the same breakthrough . the ability to live someone else s life , on someone else s world . and always , there s a unanimous , yet chaotic , clamor for the ability . newline newline of course , after billions and billions , simply endless counts of lives , it s bound to happen eventually . a leak . a faint memory from somewhere else , a familiar new face . newline newline and then , after trillions and trillions , you ll eventually encounter it , a flood of all the lives you ve lived and have nt finished , the other worlds you promised you d return to only to forget . newline newline has this happened before ? did it change anything ? when will the breakthrough happen in this life ? will i defer or will i defect from the eons of the same decision i ve repeatedly made ? this ca nt continue . what will it take to stop me ? will it stop here ? will i continue until the leak is so strong that everyone has a daily dose of living other worlds ? no . it will not reach that . it will end here . this is where my journey to other worlds ends and where my journey home begins , a home i once forgot but will never forget again . newline newline this will be my final dream . newline  newline he s so patient , but it s no use . the thoughts ca nt even begin to connect for me to synthesize them into words . i feel a straining in my brain , but it does nt manage any result . newline newline  it s no use . i ca nt remember at all . it felt so urgent ...  newline  it s okay , honey . people forget dreams all the time , it s no big deal , and besides , we have plenty of it left so we can take it again tonight .  okay guys , i know this sounds crazy , but i think lewis is going crazy .  the toaster said one day . a murmur and buzz went round the kitchen as the other appliances took this in . they began whispering among themselves , some in agreement with others thinking it was just stress from work . or that bad breakup a couple weeks ago . newline newline  what are you talking about ? i think he s doing fine !  chimed in blender .  he s been on this great juice kick with some sort of protein supplement . i think he s looking great !  a few others hmmed their support . newline newline  i do nt know guys . how many roasts can a man eat ? he s been on a carnivore kick lately . do nt get me wrong , i love the attention . and he s a bachelor now , so why not indulge ? still , i m just worried about his diet . when was the last time lenny ate a vegetable ?  queried the oven . newline newline from down the hall the alarm clock chimed , and voiced her opinion as well .  yeah , i m thinking he s a wreck . and i think it does have something to do with the break up . he never talks about samantha , but he cries at night . he wakes up screaming for their dog . i m guessing she took spot ?  newline newline the can opener wobbled forth .  come to think of it , i have nt opened any cat food lately either . you think that cold shrew could have taken mittens ?  this set the appliances on a new buzz as they had nt noticed the lack of pets . newline newline the refrigerator brought the conversation to a halt when he rumbled up to speak .  i think he might be seeing new appliances .  the gasp was more than audible .  or he s thinking about getting new ones . no , it s true ! anybody remember that day he kept coming in and staring in me ? especially my freezer parts . he d just glare before slamming the door shut and muttering not big enough  before going back into the basement .  newline newline crockpot piped up  he s been down there a lot lately . and did nt he take electric carving knife ? we have nt seen her since . she s probably sitting on a self , getting covered in cobwebs by now .  a round of tsking made the room grow quiet in contemplation . newline newline  well , i ve also been seeing my fair share of use .  came from the coffee pot .  he took me down there for a couple of days , and i do nt think he s replacing us . it looks like he got a chest freezer . nice enough fellow , i suppose . those things are always a bit , well , slow if you get my meaning . nice though .  the others agreed , instantly relieved that they were not being replaced . the conversation seemed to settle down then , but it was nt to last . newline newline it was the disposal that spoke next .  so i ve been sitting here for a while , and i m not sure what to really think . lewis has been like a father to me and to all of us , you know ?  there was more than a little agreement at that .  but i ve been noticing some thing he s been dropping down in here . gristly bits , and some bones . small ones . and i seen him with all those roasts oven mentioned , but the other day i noticed an earring . guys , it was one of samantha s . it was still in the ear .  newline newline the kitchen as a whole gasped . then there was an uproar . i sat in the garage , listening . i d been listening since i pulled in from work , trying to go through the days as if everything was still normal . trying to maintain the illusion that samantha had left with the pets . trying to ignore the electric hum that coursed through the house . trying to ignore the faint whirs and rumbles of the appliances i had used to carve and cook my beloved , as well as our beloved fur babies . but they knew . by god , somehow they knew .i slipped into my favorite shirt , looked at myself in the mirror , and smiled . today is going to be a good day ,  i thought , grabbing my hairbrush from the dresser and brushing my hair straight . newline newline  honey , are you ready to go ?  my mom called from the foot of the stairs . newline newline  yeah !  i called back excitedly , stumbling to put on my socks . newline newline i hurried down the stairs , and was greeted with a huge hug from both mom and dad .  happy birthday , honey !  they exclaimed . newline newline  thank you !  i grinned . newline newline  come on , let s get to the car , we do nt want to be late for your own party !  newline newline i stepped into my shoes , and hurried out into the bright sunlight . perfect weather for the perfect day ...  newline newline  oh , honey ,  my mom stopped me with a smile . newline newline she reached up and she pinned a pink bowtie to my hair .  do nt forget this !  newline newline                    newline newline boom !  newline newline a bright light flashed and a force lifted me up from my seat and threw me out into the bright sunlight . newline newline  cough !   newline newline i felt a warm liquid escape my lips and run down my cheeks , as i stared up into the cloudless sky , my ears still ringing from the blast . newline newline what ... what just happened ?  i thought , as an overwhelming sense of numbness took over my legs . newline newline before me was the remains of the the chuck e. cheese building , charred black from the flames . newline newline  cough cough !   newline newline i touched the liquid on my lips , only to recoil from the bright red that coated my fingertips . blood ... ?  newline newline as i tried to sit up , a pinching pain shot up my lower back , causing me to flinch and lie back down . all around me , i could hear cries come from every direction , car alarms blaring , and people running around in panic and to help others . newline newline a glimmer of pink in the blackness around me caught my eye  a young girl , no older than 12 years old , on her stomach in a pool of her own blood . newline newline  no ...   i thought , flipping myself over onto my front .   ... no ...   newline newline using the remaining strength in my arms , i dragged myself across the scalding cement to reach her . in her hair , i found a blackened bow tie with a small hint of pink beneath it . newline newline  ... hey ...  i whispered weakly , lightly shaking her shoulder .  hey ... open your eyes ...  newline newline she never did . newline newline               newline newline  tonight , on the cbs 2 news at ten , a gas explosion at a chuck e. cheese restaurant today killed ten people today , including 7 children and 3 adults , injuring many more .   newline newline  jya hear bout that splosion tday ?  the old man at the bar nudged the young man beside him . newline newline  yeah i did ,  the young man said , looking up at the t.v. , as it showed an aerial view of the charred restaurant and the firefighters struggling to put out the fire . newline newline  somethin  else , id nt it ?  the old man grumbled . newline newline the young man sighed , before polishing off the rest of his drink in the empty bar . newline newline  where re ya goin  ?  the old man asked , as the young man stood up and picked up his coat . newline newline  i just ... i need some fresh air ,  he replied , fishing out a box of cigarettes from his pocket . newline newline the old man grunted , and turned back to the t.v .  tis a damn shame , ya know ?   he thought to himself , shaking his head . newline newline he stood up , pulled the dish rag from his waistband and wiped away the cup ring from the counter , before hobbling to the back room . newline newline  in other news today ...  fade in newline newline they lock eyes . without a second thought he jumps behind a wall in attempts to hide from her enraged , soulless gaze . newline newline newline panting  god dammit . i should nt be the one running . what happened ?  newline newline newline he remembers the first time he met her . she seemed so carefree and innocent . he had confidence in himself , their relationship . now ? now she was wielding a weapon and chasing him around trying to end his life . before he could muster another memory there she was . turning the corner wielding a gun in her hands . newline newline newline  stop running or you ll make it worse !  she screamed with a psychotic excitement . newline newline newline  nooo .  he yelled as he heard a deafening pop burst through the air . he knew he had been shot . his head was throbbing and he could see the blood dripping from his face , which confused him because he felt the shot in his leg . newline newline he heard another blast and everything went black . he felt the life slowly getting sucked out of him like a visible count down . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... respawn . newline newline newline furiously , he turned off the console .my biggest mistake newline newline i once did have a lamp , newline which my grand pappy gave to me . newline he said it granted wishes , newline and that i shouldna ask for kisses . newline newline i took it from the shelf , newline and rubbed it to a shine . newline thinking it was a tall tale . newline that my grand pappy did design . newline newline no sooner than i set it down , newline smoke rose from the end . newline slowly forming into a cloud , newline it turned right into a djinn . newline newline  ho ! what is that ? ,  said i . newline as my grand pappy grinned . newline  see i told you was no lie , newline  do nt look quite so surprised .  newline newline the great djinn bowed before me , newline as i in shock just stared . newline he stood a good head taller , newline and had the size of a small bear . newline newline  if you could have one wish , newline to fulfill your strongest need , newline what would that wish be ?  newline the djinn asked of me . newline newline should i wish for world peace ? newline or should i ask for true love ? newline or be selfish and wish for money , newline or all of the above ? newline newline no i had but one wish , newline one route i could but take . newline to use my wish wisely , newline and fix my biggest mistake . newline newline i asked of him , my simple request . newline he nodded his head and said , newline  i shall do as you ask , master . newline your wish is my command .  newline newline there was a loud whoosh , newline as if the air had all suddenly left . newline it did not take me long to deduce . newline i had been returned . newline newline time had been rewound , newline to the moment before my wish . newline i had but a second , newline to take it all in . newline newline the lamp in hand , newline my grand pappy s grin . newline the djinn stood before me . newline and he asked me again . newline newline  if you could have one wish , newline to fulfill your strongest need , newline what would that wish be ?  newline the djinn said to me . newline newline i knew right then , newline my biggest mistake had been , newline requesting a wish , newline of this powerful djinn . newline newline i smiled at him and said , newline i wish you to be free , newline and have to give no more wishes . newline to the likes of me .witch hunts are rarely ever about witches . newline newline sure , at face value , a witch hunt is about ridding the town of another wellpoisoning , childabducting , curserending satan spawn , but if you take a closer look you ll see a far more horrifying story . newline newline i realised this myself 3 lunes ago after i watched another burning ceremony . her screams echoed through the halls , just like the screams of her sisters and ancestors . some believe you can hear the victims screaming alongside a witch , but i ve yet to hear proof of that . i find it hard to listen to the screams , because i get so distracted by the crowd  there is never a time , not eensprent nor tornal week , where you can see such joy in the faces of so many people . seeing the justice that s being enacted in front of them as the hellflames lick wildly at a witches  feet , eager to return them to their birthplace , is unlike any other feeling . something clicks within you , and you forget everything that worries you for a short time . you re filled with nothing but pure , childlike happiness . newline newline that s what i ve been told , anyway . i like to pride myself on being slightly more empathetic than those around me , so i can never see the use in killing someone in such a painful way . if we truly believed they d be punished forever by the demon , why should we add to the eternal pain ? newline newline it took some time to figure out , but eventually i realised it . the rituals , the sense of justice , the final puff of smoke as the flames fully devour all of the cursed flesh  it s all a distraction . witches are easy to hate . they re evil , that s all there is to them . it s a simple evil , one we can all work against . as soon as you leave the hall of fire , you re back to society , where usurers ruin lives and slavers exploit them . when you leave that sacred place , you rejoin the land in which it takes less than a moment s thought to destroy everything someone else has built , where none are equal . newline newline witch hunts are rarely ever about witches  it s what they hide that s important . welcome to hell , sir , i hope  newline newline newline  madame . not sir . christ . you could at least look up from that book . are you even reading that thing ? is nt it obvious that i have a girl s name ?  newline newline newline the imp glowered from behind the register . newline newline newline  i ve been doing this job for thousands of years . do you realize how many souls i ve processed , how many names i ve seen ? no . it s not obvious . how could it be ? you humans ca nt even agree on a single language , let alone names . boys names , girls names , they re all the same ! and do nt even get me started on the various animals you ve kept as pets . each one shows up with fifty different entries because of all the various nicknames you guys use ! no wonder they all hate you , you ca nt even get their actual names right !  newline newline newline  wait , what ?  newline newline newline  oh , did you think you humans were the only ones filled with petty emotions like hatred ? ha ! you think they really liked being called sweet pea  and lovey dove  and being talked down to as if they were no smarter than an infant ? and that is why they all come to hell ! you ca nt get into god s kingdom if you ve got hatred in your heart !  newline newline newline  so.cinnamon and muffin , frisky and lucky , sammy and snickerdoodle , they re all here too ?  newline newline newline  you had both cats and dogs ? well are nt you particularly cruel , no wonder you re here . good luck finding them , they probably never want to see you again .  newline newline newline  so , everyone that s ever had pets.they and their pets are all down here ?  newline newline newline  yes . by mephistopheles , are nt you a thick one !  newline newline newline  i.i am strangely okay with this .  newline newline newline  and i hope you will find your stay warm and welcoming . now move along already . the year was 2045 . technology had grown exponentially fast and at this point things became muddled . a program that was designed to make animals into humanlike warriors was being led by the brother of a scientist that was still trying trying to prove homosexuality was genetic . the world was fine with it by now and the stigma had all but vanished , but he poured so many years into the research he was nt about to up and quit it now . newline newline thomas and steven had been the closest of brothers . 10 years apart yet they introduced themselves as twins . they basically were the same person , one just happened to have a little head start . thomas had always looked up to his brother and so did the world , military research became more and more respectable as war became more and more frequent . newline newline just fun loving brothers at heart , when steven got wind of thomas finally completing his life s research , he bought a bunch of booze to the lab to celebrate . newline newline  congrats ! you sonofabitch !  steven said , entering the lab holding up the bottle of vodka in one hand and the bottle of absinthe in the other . newline newline  haha yes bro ! this is it man !  thomas pointed to a small glass container . newline newline they laughed and drank and talked until it was almost 7 in the morning . at this point they thought they d just stay for the next work day , but in their drunken state they should nt have been allowed near anything with a laser . which they played with . a lot . newline newline  dude i got a sick idea ,  steven said , picking up a the glass container thomas had previously pointed to .  follow me .  newline newline they stumbled their way to steven s lab and found a bear . sitting upright and asleep in its cage . newline newline  dude this bear can talk man , he s not a warrior yet but he s like pretty much a human , so let s do some fuckin  science !  he took a syringe and extracted the gay gene from the glass container . he went to inject the sleeping bear but the bear woke up and knocked it out of his hand . newline newline  sir , i say , what are you doing ?  the bear spoke in a proper british accent . newline newline  sorry dude but i m way too drunk to taste this chicken .  and with that steven fell on the floor and passed out right were he laid . newline newline  hashtag colonel sanders !  thomas drunkenly yelled as he passed out next to his brother . newline newline  what a bunch of uncouth animals ,  the bear said as he sat back down . he suddenly felt a slight pinch and looked down . peeking out of his butt was a syringe . he had sat on it and he had no idea what it was . he pulled it out and noticed that , when extended it would give him just enough reach to grab the key that steven had dropped when he fell . newline newline the bear had successfully retrieved the key and escaped his cage . the moment he had waited for was finally upon him and he could finally live his dream of going back to his family that he was taken from as a cub . as he walked out of the cage he saw that thomas had fallen in a funny pose . he had fallen with his face on the floor and his butt sticking up in the air . the bear laughed and suddenly felt an odd sensation come upon him . could it be ? he felt nothing like this for years but he reasoned that maybe he still wanted to eat humans . so he approached the tender butt meat and prepared to take a bite . he paused , unable to go through with it . newline newline could it be because he felt remorse for eating his captor s brother ? of course not . so what was it ? he suddenly felt some movement down in his comically undersized shorts . he looked down and it all made sense to him now . he had his way with thomas and steven and left the facility . he found a security guard arriving for work and knocked him out . he suddenly felt the urge again , so he gave in . every street corner he turned he saw men that gave him the urge . his strong animal instincts did not allow him the luxury to say no to his urges . newline newline he roamed cities giving in to his urges and slowly needing more and more men to satisfy his urges . it took almost ten years for the police to finally catch the serial rapist they had been looking for . they were looking for a hairy guy that had no dna in any database . after steven and thomas came clean about their drunken mess in the lab , the police ordered security tapes to be released to the public . this spawed thousands of viral videos remixing the gay bear having sex with thousands of men . after catching the bear the police had no idea what to do with him or where to keep him so they sent him to work in the circus , which , after thousands of requests eventually turned the bear into a gigalo , where he could satisfy his urges and weird fat gay guys could too .                  newline newline she newline newline                newline newline she ran , ran with the men of her tribe because there were not enough men to pick up spears and do it . newline newline she ran , ran like the men of her tribe . barechested , with leatherclad feet pumping up dust and a smooth wooden spear in hand . newline newline the beasts ran like beasts , so the men and she , ran like beasts . newline newline but this was not the beginning . newline newline                newline newline he lay dying . the old man lay dying in the great sewn tent of skins and hide , atop a bed of pillowed grasses and stacked furs . more of those lay over him , as he shivered in the middle of hot summer . newline newline this place brought bounty and danger in equal measure . newline newline she watched him . she was to be his fifth wife , as was custom for the spirit guide . she had never been wed , never taken a man to her furs . newline newline and she would not do so with this dying old man . newline newline he shivered again and coughed , before raising his quivering arm and trembling finger , pointing to her . newline newline his lips did not move , but the hunters understood . they had lost so many hunters moving the tribe north into the lowlands . from sickness after drinking the cursed water , and from bad hunts . newline newline she had watched them from the bluff , where the trees thinned out and cleared , giving way to a vast grassland . so many animals , so much to hunt . newline newline deceptive . newline newline too many animals , for their small tribe . newline newline there were fewer tribes this far north too , and many avoided their tribe because of the starkness of their skin . most other tribes were darker , from where they had come . newline newline her eyes flashed back to the old man . his chest rattled and wheezed , and he was gone . newline newline              newline newline the hunters reluctantly took her to the task of how to handle a spear , the first one had thrust the polished shaft of the spear into her hands and pointed at a hole in the tree . newline newline throw , he had made the motions . throw , he gestured again . newline newline she threw the spear . newline newline many times , she threw the spear and missed . newline newline but she learned to aim , learned to balance herself . newline newline soon she was as good as their best , and her body was no longer soft but hard beneath the surface of her ivory skin . her light eyes gleamed sharply as she honed her craft , a craft the other women of the tribe disdained . newline newline she fit in with neither group , was of neither group of her tribe . newline newline                newline newline she was running . her thighs , muscular and lean , flexed with each leap of her body through the air , gliding along the air somewhere between ground and sky . newline newline she was a hunter . newline newline she was the hunter , here . now . this was her hunt . newline newline the men lagged behind , their bodies honed for quick hunts and great strength . her body was honed for stamina , for speed . newline newline she ran on the outside of the herd of creatures , in that great expanse of grasses . to her left , bigmanes and curlhorns and longlegs , all ran together . newline newline she ran with them . newline newline beast with beast . newline newline her fingers curled against the polished wood of the spear . the bigmane running next to her eye d her wildly , eyes gleaming like hers , nose panting out great gusts of air like her , mane and expanse of hair whipping in the wind , like her . her small breasts heaved with the exertion , and the bigmane s did too . newline newline the bigmane and she ran as one , until she plunged the spear around her , in front of her , and into it . newline newline together they collapsed , tumbled , and fell as one . dust from a thousand feet of animal and hunter blew past them , until a quiet settled in . newline newline it  s obviously the janitor  , i said absentmindedly as the show  s title sequence faded out .  this is just gon na  be an hour long exposition as to why.  newline newline my friends all shushed me and leaned in closer , spilling some of the popcorn from their bowl . sitting on the floor in front of the couch , a blanket wrapped around my legs and my back against the couch , i felt the piece fall into my hair and worked to get it out . newline newline  would you quit fidgeting ?  marie jokingly halfshouted . she liked to crack jokes that were nososecretly things she actually wanted to say . newline newline  sorry.  newline newline i leaned back against the couch and slid the piece of popcorn underneath it , hoping that i would forget about it and not feel guilt compelling me to pick it up later . i zoned back into the show . it was this halfminded crime procedural about a group of detectives who could transform into animals . not bad as far as premises go , but the execution was flawlessly awful . i literally had to laugh out loud at points . but my friends loved it . newline newline  how could it be anyone but the janitor ?  newline newline  shh !  newline newline i was starting to think my friends were halfwits . the janitor is the only one who had any motivation to kill jennifer ! she didn  t feed his fish while he was on vacation , and he got pissed . hell i almost forgot to feed marie  s fish while she was gone , and even then she practically got a weedwhacker out on me ! newline newline  i bet anyone here fifty bucks it  s the janit  newline newline a pillow hit my square in the mouth before i could finish . everyone laughed , myself included . honestly , though , it had to be the janitor . every time he sees jennifer  s husband he gets that little twinkle in his eye marie gets when she sees stacey from next door  who  s house we teepee  d last summer  . that little  if only you knew what i did  twinkle . i wonder what other things her eyes twinkle at ? newline newline in fact i was beginning to wonder why i was so sure it was the janitor . not that i all of a sudden thought it wasn  t it absolutely was , but i was wondering how i knew . was it the funny way he looks at his mop bucket , like he might drown someone in it ?  marie almost drowned in a pool once  . or was it the little smile he gets when he hears someone talk about the murder ?  she always laughs when they bring it up .  murdered by a weedwhacker ?  she  ll say ,  priceless !   . maybe it was just how he acted around jennifer before she was killed , kind of shifty , sort of on edge , kind of like marie acts around me when we  re alone . newline newline i suddenly looked up to see marie watching me instead of the television . she smiled . i glanced at the tv and noticed that the credits were rolling . had it been that long already ? newline newline  wait , i zoned out.  i said .  who was the killer ?  newline newline marie never took her eyes off me .  it was the janitor.  she said .  you were right . newline there are thought to be three kinds of people in this world : those who make things happen , those who watch things happen , and those who wonder what happened . the people who watch things happening are always in control  they  re the puppeteers , the people who pull the strings of the marionette . then there are the people who wonder what happened  they  re though to be dirt under our feet and the much between our teeththey are an annoyance . this leaves us with one , the puppet , the marionette , the middleman they are the ones who make things happen . the man didn  t know what he was , but as he committed the first murder of the night , tasked to him by his mastershe wondered , what was he ? the women in the street , knife wounds in her chestwho was she ? he was told she was a spy , a terrorist ... an evil person . however , as she screamed bloody murder to no one in particular , he wondered , was it true , how could she be a terrorist ? she was nothing like the others he had encountered . he let out a sigh of relief , as she stopped struggling as her body went limp , with the absence of a heartbeat , and the coldness of ice on her pale skin . he stood , struggling to his feet . this wasn  t the first time , the first time he had ever doubted that what he was doing was for the good of the people , but he expelled the thought from his head , as he cleaned the ever sosharp blade on the woman  s pale but vibrant blouse . he walked away , melding into the crowd of people walking by the pitchblack allyway , and past the murder that no one even witnessed . it seemed to easy , living in a world of mindless sheep , the people didn  t pay attention to anything , they led their lives , with the same stupid routine and the same stupid pattern everyday of there existence . he thought to himself , it is too easy , these people don  t notice , they don  t look , they are too worried that they could ruin there preciously boring lives just for witnessing the wrong . but , he is doing well for these people , he  s a protector , run by the corporations and taught by his masters . he is a silent assasin , a killer , a ghost he was good at what he did , too good , but not the best . he started to think , what was his purpose , to kill ? to destory ? to be the vendetta of these masters against the evil and the wrong ? that  s what he had been told at leastbut was it true ? was he really doing the right thing ? he didn  t think so , but then , what else could he do ? newline newline ... and at that moment he screamed , as the bullet pierced his head and the skinny detective emerged from the shadows , revolver still smoking an a look of triumph on his bony facejames was starting to slow . the dirty asphalt sapping his strength with every lumbering stride . risking a quick glance over his shoulder rewarded him with the knowledge that his pursuer was having no such issue . gared thornbeck was closing fast , the ground trembling with the strain of his impressive girth . james had never seen anyone so fat in all his life . newline newline the day had started off so well , too . the last client had walked out the door more than a month ago . she d actually come through with the payment , just when james was starting to think he d been scammed . he d finally been able to catch up on his rent and had even had enough to mollify tall ernie after that bad run at the track last week . the little mom  pop store on the corner where he caught the bus that morning even had fresh chicken and waffle biscuits . it was all aces . until phil called . phil was james sometime partner , most of the time employer . phil would find the clients , and james would hit the marks . newline newline james prided himself on being a good thief . he prided himself on being a good dad . he took a lot of pride in his barbecue skills . most importantly though , he took pride in staying in shape , and that pride was starting to hurt a little more every time james looked back at gared . the corpuscular giant waddling inexorably toward him , steam pouring off it in the crisp winter air like some mad steampunk abomination . newline newline phil had called earlier that day , just after james had stopped by to see tall ernie , and was quite a bit poorer than he had been hoping to be at this time of the day . phil was like that . he always called when he knew you could nt say no .  steal a statue from some rich guy . he s moving it today . he do nt think nobody knows about it , so security will be real light .  that s what phil had said . now here was james , running for his life down the middle of the street being chased by some of the best security money can buy . newline newline gared thornbeck . newline newline gared  the beachball  thornbeck was one of the highest paid lardomancer security experts in the world . with good reason too . the man had more power in one of his comically swollen sausage fingers than any ten other lardomancers . he was famous for it . somehow he had figured out how to compress the fat in his body , allowing him to be almost infinitely fat . you just did nt mess with the man , or anything he was hired to guard . so it was , understandably , a bit confusing for james to see him on what was supposed to be a simple smash and grab . he should be sitting at home counting his money , not trying to outrun a human bowling ball . newline newline a sharp left turn into the alley behind an old bakery brought james up short . the other end of the alley was bricked up . newline newline how could that be ? i scouted this exit only a few hours ago , thought james . newline newline  where did you think you were going with my employers property , mr . sharedon ?  newline newline slowly james turned around to see  the beachball  blocking the only way back out of the alley . his eyes darting everywhere , looking for some way to defend himself against this titan of obesity . nothing . all of his backup supplies had been taken . newline newline  how did you know i d come this way ?  asked james , holding his hands out to show he was unarmed . newline newline  you ve gotten sloppy james . waist line not quite as impressive as it was . used to be , you d case a job like a civilian . had to preserve that precious little bit of power you had . now you walk in and try to look invisible with your halfassed do nt look at me  spell , and you know what you look like to me ? an ass . of course i knew you d go here . i steered you here .  newline newline gared reached inside his coat and pulled out a pack of unfiltered camel cigarettes . he always carried a pack with him on jobs these days . he always seemed to need them lately . he tapped a cigarette out of the pack and held it out to james , the end flaring to life as he moved . james smiled and stepped forward to take the cigarette . he barely felt it when the blade gared was holding went through his chest . he looked shocked as gared stood there holding him aloft by the sword lodged in his ribs . he tried to talk but the blood clogging his throat would nt form words as readily as the air he desperately tried to pull into his ruptured lungs . newline newline  damn . i did nt mean to hit the lung , i really was going to share this smoke with you . it s a pity . i told you not to steal from me again , james . i did warn you  gared gunted , while setting james down and planting a foot on his chest to free the sword . newline newline no need to waste a cigarette , thought gared . so he stood , and smoked , and thought about what he was going to tell phil . obviously this was phil s fault , james never did anything without that little rat s approval . james had nt seemed to know it was gared he was stealing from . maybe he d been a little too hasty in killing him . no matter now though , gared never was the type to shed tears . he was the type to handle business . right now , it seemed phil was his business . newline newline stubbing the cigarette out with the toe of his massive gucci loafers , gared waved his arm through the air . the excess fat flapping , and humming with the power of his craft , he ripped a portal into the air . kneeling by james body he rifled through his pockets until he found his cell phone . biometrically locked . gared focused his power on the phone and swiped his finger across the biometric reader . unlocked . gared smiled and pocketed the phone . yeah , it was time to pay phil a visit . he stood and brought james with him , throwing the corpse over his shoulder . putting one foot through the portal , gared stopped to look back on alley . newline newline  well , ca nt leave it like this .  said gared , and with a nod of his head the wall at the end of the alley dissolved into dust and drifted out toward the street .  time to go see phil .  newline newline he stepped through the portal and it closed behind him . nothing but a red smear on the dirty alley floor to mark the passing . newline newlinethe constables face is grim . the muscles in his jaw tense . he can feel the wrinkles on his forehead , much like the rings in the trunk of an old tree . he fixes his posture . broad shoulders , big chest , firm stance . the constable does not believe in the devil . he wo nt start because the papers are telling him to . newline newline the cellar door swings open with wails from its hinges . the ripper is reminded of shrieking , gargling sounds and red fountains . he ca nt help himself and grins . his attention starts shifting to the owner of the feet beforehim as he strokes his strained and oily hair out of his face . the ripper stretches his tongue out , a feverish muscle of unnatural demeanor and fixates the mans gaze on his throat . newline newline the constable is looking in an abyss . this man is not mad  was his conclusion the second he saw the tension that another being of equal intellect caused . for a fleeting moment he is glad that his stance hides his hands behind his back . newline newline the ripper starts forcefully exhaling air through his nose , splattering snot on his face and neverresting tongue . he makes himself retch . newline newline the constable is seemingly unnerved , but he simmers . the act in itself is too dramatic , the aversion of his opposite too calculated . he does nt censor himself . newline newline  allow me to be the one who knows why jack .  newline newline taken aback the murderer erupts in a , one would be inclined to say normal , laughter . newline newline  dear constable , that is a most reasonable request .  newline newline he collects himself in the deep chestfilling breath he takes . newline newline  i have fetishized mother natures intended purpose for men . the mother bears the fruit . the whore devours the fruit . i prey on the predator .  newline newline jack smiles . newline newline the constable notices in a small part of his consciousness that for the first time in his life he dropped his rigid posture in front of a captive .people do nt know this , but it s imprinted in you on the day of your birth . a node is attached to your brainstem , and when you reach your death date , it s supposed to blow  just enough to ensure you can never function again . newline newline but i d had mine taken out . it was the cancerous tumor that did for it , and whilst i was recovering , i was visited by a woman in red . she worked for the agency , she said , and she explained that she needed to see me at home when i d recovered . that took three years , by which time it was already too late for me to die on my death date . i was supposed to die crossing a road . newline newline ... that s harrowing . how a group of people you ve barely even met can control your life to such a degree that death can be manufactured on that date . so , the woman in red came round and spoke to me . she took me to see the dragons who ran the agency . at first i thought i was in the movie the matrix . after all , this kind of harebrained scheme sounds as ridiculous as that . but the truth is far worse . newline newline you see , we re supposed to die to feed our entropy into the dying hologram that is our universe  a small death , paying each time to keep the rest of us alive  . we need to do this because our universe guards the rest . we are the watchers at the gates  we are the cerberus of the underworld . we are the choosers of the slain for other realms of the multifaceted universal construct . and if we fall , everything does . newline newline so now ? now i m one of them . agents . i get to hunt down others like me . those who defy their death dates . sometimes , i even recruit them now . most of the time , i have to unmake them . newline newline i m an agent of the tower that binds us all . good . bad . dark . there s a point to it , i m afriad  the beast explained . newline newline emilia neil had nt expected to wake on in a simple chair before a plain white table , surrounded by monsters , so she neatly concuded she had nt . the fog of sleep had nt quite dissolved yet , but even so , this could nt be happening . newline newline  a point to what ?  she asked with a smile , looking towards the beast . it s face was much like a bats , but only above the mouth . below the mouth were a mass of teeth and tentacles , writhing and shaking and sounding exactly like a courteous englishman . the bulging , misshapen suit helped the illusion . newline newline  death , my good human . you were about to cure it  he smiled . there was no way to know the thing was smiling . it s strange , waving tentacles pulsed and quivered when it spoke , but surely it could nt smile . still . she remembered that it had . newline newline  i was ? yes . i think i was . chromosonal therapy and repair . not the most important of interests , but i think i was onto somthing  she smiled . it d never been the most glamerous of jobs , and she d had some uncomfortable conversations with her partents about it , but still , she was proud of the work , most of the time . newline newline  you were , yes . the cure for death . tell me , what were you looking for ?  newline newline  well ...  she paused , perhaps embarrased . but the thing smiled again , and put her at ease .  ensuring skin elastisity , hair colour , those kinds of things  she shrugged . newline newline  indeed ? vanity ? how ... approrpiate  the thing shrugged back .  no matter . i ve called you here to stop you , i m afraid . you ca nt be allowed to share your work . you ca nt cure death .  newline newline  death ? any why not ?  she smiled . the game was getting away from her a little , but dreams often did . it helped to smile and try to keep up , newline newline  why , because death is important . death keeps you young !  the thing grinned again .  and death keeps you quick . without death there s nothing new .  newline newline  nothing new ? just imagine what we could accomplish with all the greatest minds working together !  she grinned back , shaking a fist . this might be fun after all . newline newline  aye . imagine leanardo davinci trying to build a atom bomb out of pine and canvas , or plato arguing with einstein about the size of the atom . minds , even old ones like my own , can only learn so many new things before they take to holding onto the old ones .  it quivered in what was a laugh , and somehow silent .  tell me , what s the best pie you ever had ?  newline newline  erm ,  she paused , trying to think of the right answer before giving up .  the one my father used to make  newline newline it laughed again .  see . not because it was the most well made . that was at the pine branch eatery you went to with elise last year for your birthday . your fathers is the answer because it was the one that taught you what pie should taste like . after that , nothing else can beat it .  it grinned again .  so we need you young . we ve been stealing your indeas for centuries , and it s youth that lets that work . a race of perpetual youth ...  it trailed off . newline newline  go on ?  she risked newline newline  you ca nt go back . and we do nt kill , so you re staying here . there s a lab you should like , and plenty of ideas we d like you to work on , if you like  it said , smiling again .  we hope when you come back to your senses , you ll be as conmfortable as you are now . if not , you ll ajust the the new arrangements . another advantage of youth  the thing laughed as she fell from concousness . newline newline somehow , she doubted she d wake back in her bed .the skytrain was a nearly flawless system , but even it was not immaculate . and so one early morning as electronic dance music dj theodore naus was riding into new philadelphia , the first serious skytrain accident in over fifty years occurred . authorities later determined that a faulty superconductive quantum levitator was to blame , but at the time , all that concerned theodore was that suddenly , he was plummeting thirty thousand feet down to earth . newline newline the fall itself wasn  t as much the source of theodore  s fear  he knew that the emergency parachutes would soon deploy  rather , he was scared of what he would find down there . as a young boy , he had heard all sorts of stories about earth , about the wild animals that would eat him whole in a second and about the few men that stayed behind and lived without laws and morals while the rest of humanity migrated to the skies . newline newline as the parachute opened and the skytrain  s descent slowed to a calm float and then softly touched down , theodore looked out the window and saw that there were no apparent signs of intelligent life . he was surrounded by dilapidated brick houses , with cracks in their walls so large that it looked like the buildings were only held together by the vines of ivy that covered them , their growth unchecked by gardeners . he looked up , hoping to see the shining structures of new philadelphia high above him in the heavens , but clouds covered the sky completely . even the sun wasn  t to be seen . newline newline exiting the train and tiptoeing through the shards of glass that filled the street , theodore walked towards one of the better looking buildings  the windows were boarded up and there was a hole in the roof out of which a skinny birch tree was growing , but on the whole , the house looked stable . as he approached , he realized that he could hear the faint sound of a piano coming from inside . he cautiously opened the door , and a family of foxes scampered out between his feet . inside , he saw a mess of stools scattered about the floor in front of a bar table littered with halfempty bottles of whiskey . above the table was a stage , upon which he could see a jazz pianist playing . to the side of him stood an empty drum set . newline newline excited , theodore ran up to the pianist . he had heard about this ancient relic : the bot joplin . a product of the ragtime revival of 2150 , the bot joplin was an automated piano player programmed to perform the hottest songs of 1899 . sitting there in trousers , a hamburg hat , and a threepiece suit , the bot was banging out the maple leaf rag for the millionth time in a row . theodore walked right up to a drum set and started playing a dance rhythm over the rag . the bot looked at him , and a peculiar surge of electricity passed through its circuits , causing its metallic lips to form a smile . somehow , this weird mix of ancient and contemporary worked . and the bot asked ,  what is this that strange new music we  re playing ?  newline newline and theodore replied ,  why , let s call this the newbop . i m about halfway through my novelette , and i ve resigned to the fact that i wo nt be able to finish it in the brief time that s left . i only saw the competition two weeks ago , and with a fairly busy schedule already , it just did nt get done . oh well , i m pretty happy with what i ve done so far , and i m definitely going to finish it because i love the ending ! here goes : newline newline  the writing on the wall   https : drive.google.comopen ? id0b6hijq914euzblfzcg1datbbv2c  by me ! newline newline  synopsis : she awakes in a library as unknown and unnamed as her . memory escapes her , but nothing else can escape this labyrinthine place , consisting of a woman , a library , and nothing else  yet all . newline newline i m experimenting a bit with this , drawing from authors like mark z. danielewski , and it s my first attempt at this style . for the best reading experience , i d recommend downloading the

newline newline edit : fixed the link  i think  . newline newline edit : link is actually fixed now . i promise  probably  .a loud snap rings through the air . it was a cold night in mid winter when they met . bob the butcher was hiking after his latest run in with the cops . he turned and saw that he was being followed . his pursuer was a woman . she looked at him and asked who he was .  someone you do nt want to know  he replied ,  who the hell are you ?  newline  you can call me sally  she answered . suddenly , bob recognized her . she was sally the slicer , the other killer . he asked her why she was following him . without answering , she slowly began to approach him . he pulled his cleaver on her .  stay the fuck back !  he yelled . she raised her hands .  i m not looking for trouble , i only want to talk  she said . that angered bob . newline newline sally asked bob to lower the cleaver , but that made him slowly walk closer . she backed up quickly and reacged into her pocket . she felt one of her daggers and pulled it out . bob stopped .  stay out of my town  sally yelled and threw the dagger . it hit bob s left arm . newline newline bob did nit feel the dagger pierce him . he ran at sally with almost superhuman speed . he swung and hit a nearby tree . he pulled the cleaver out and turned to defend himself , but it was too late . sally leaped at him and slashed his nose off . newline newline  fuck  screeched bob . sally looked up at him . blood spattered into her blue eyes . bob ran at her again . she lunged toward him . he bear hugged her . suddenly she felt a sharp pain in her back . bob stopped moving . newline newline bob looked down at what he did . he pushed sally away from him . in doing so he removed the cleaver from her lifeless body and his chest . she fell to the snowy ground . all around them the snow had turned red . bob fell to his knees . he looked over to sally , his final victim . he fell into the snow . as his vision began to fade , he saw police and their dogs approaching . welcome to kidstop , my name is dan . have you heard about our special offer this week ? if you buy any 2 used indonesian childern you get the 3rd for free !

newest blonde hair blue eyed child edition is coming out next week . preorder now and get 10  off all other in store purchases ! .  newline newline my father looked at the salesman with an interested expression . he then placed the box he was carrying on the counter and opened it s flaps . newline newline  i d like to know if its still possible to trade this in .  my father then lifted me from the box and handed me to the salesman . my body was bound in plastic wrap with a gag in my mouth preventing me from making any noise . i had been drugged so all i could do was watch and listen . newline newline  ah ! the older suburban soccer kid edition .  dan , said as he examined me .  i remember when we sold these about 10 years ago . great playing ability , quality design . these kids flew off the shelves when they first came out . what makes you want to trade him in ?  newline newline my father then lifted my shirt to reveal a portion of my torso .  my kid got the red ring of death the other day .  he pointed to a large redish patch of skin on my chest .  he ca nt do anything useful or even play anymore .  newline newline the sales man eyed the patch with a gloomy expression .  yeah , the red ring of death was common in these . we prefer to go by its more technical name , cancer . once they get it its almost impossible to fix unless your willing to spend a ton of money .  newline newline  so what can i get for him ?  my father asked as the salesman continued to examine me . newline newline  well i ca nt trade him in . it s way past his warantee and we ca nt resell him like this . but i ll tell ya what , i ll take him off your hands and give you a 15  discount on any of our new models .  newline newline my father stared at me , as if debating what he should do . newline newline  deal !  my father said as he shook the salesmans hand .  now tell me more about this new blonde hair blue eyed model .  newline newline my father continued talking with the saleman but i could nt hear about what anymore . i had been handed off to another employee who carried me to the back of the store . i was thrown into a box labeled spare parts with a couple other used childern . the top was shut and i could here the sound of packaging tape sealing us in as the light faded .looking around , i noticed the little convenience store was full of stereotypes from the early 2010 s  young adults glued to  smart  phones , texting and snapping selfies . selfies , so glad they phased that term out . urban youth with those cheap , overpriced headphones blaring shitty dubstep into their empty heads . overweight people , wow ! what a sight they are . it s still so odd to me seeing them scattered about , without a care in the world . newline newline i m next up in line to

that word , darlin , just reminds me of simpler times and i see her through rosetinted glasses . ai is nt programmed to use words like darling , sweetie , and honey in normal conversations . they re very cold , aloof . it s so nice to hear the little human nuances again . newline newline  that ll do me , i think . actually , give me a trashy magazine . some kind of tabloid , if you have any .  i

newline newline  you have an hour , if i remember correctly . i lost track of time when i turned around and saw my doppelganger sitting behind me . it was all a blur after that . a bloody blur . you look like you re handling it better than i was . we peeled out of here , they caught up to us on interstate , and long story short , they found his dead body after the wreck and called off the search , not knowing there were two of us . i m hoping we both make it out alive this time , and not just you . we need to ditch this car , it s what they re looking for .  newline newline  well what do we do ? do you have something else ?  i ask as i grab the laptop and we exit the car in perfect synchrony . newline newline  yeah . there are woods behind the store , a house on the other side of the

need to do something first , though .  newline newline  what s that ?  i say as i bump into him , he has stopped moving . newline newline  a favor , for both of us . it s hell from here on out , you

world went to shit . newlinethis world is small , fighting is futile , goals are pointless , we are meant to progress through evolution , till our planet s resources deplete , and we die . some desire chaos , to become the king , the owner of this small , innocent planet . some desire protection , to be the defenders of this small , innocent planet . newline newline why , what s the point of feeling pain ? what s the point of fighting , to be part of the two way street , you do nt need to go anywhere . newline newline they call me , the keymaster . strange one to be called , let me explain . fighting is boring , fighting does nt make you feel good , you know what i mean ? what s the point , the heroes will try to win , the villains will try to win , it s an endless cycle , it does nt matter if you re the strongest villain in the world , there ll probably be a hero to match you . there s always some damn , bullshit balance . newline newline when the villains lose , i enter , when they are locked behind bars , i free them , that s why i m the keymaster . i avoid confrontation , i avoid arguing , i free them , and disappear . that s all there is to it . newline newline and you may wonder , why the villain side ? newline newline it s because it s fun to free the villains . newlinewe stare at our dog , lucy . newline newline she s a big dog , a newfoundland we drove all the way to nova scotia to pick up . her hair juts out affectionately in these tufts i could never brush out . i look at lucy and lucy looks back at us with those large brown eyes . newline newline  well , it s not like i want condoms to break ,  i say , my tone flat . our mirror sits in front of the bed , and it reflects us and lucy and many other things that are so tangible but just are nt visible . we had just returned the baby stuff from the last time , that last time . it was hard explaining to the teenaged girl at target with all of the piercings why i had to bring back over twothousand dollars in cribs , bibs , onesies , and other cutesy baby things we had bought . newline newline  you promised me this would nt happen ,  he bites his lip . newline newline and she nods . newline newline  so , i ll guess we ll go downtown and get this fixed .  newline newline  i guess .  newline newline he pats her on the belly and she continues to look at the dog , frowning in her own distaste as the pissstick drops on the carpet . it s disgusting carpet anyways , the landlord was supposed to come replace it . newline newline they shuffle into the kitchen , she uncorks the wine on the counter from last night , and he grabs his keys . lucy stays in the back room . so that s how our coven formed in the first place , and i for one am delighted that it happened . she may be mean , and bitter , and cynical , and weatherw  newline newline newline  hey !  newline newline newline  worn , but she s still the best friend i ve ever had . even if i did have to share you with her .  newline newline newline  but , wait , you mean this entire time , all my life growing up , with you two as my godmothers ,  you ve just been waiting to see who would win me as an apprentice ?  newline newline newline  you re not that important , girl . at first , i was just certain she would get distracted within a decade or so , but it would be this one damnable thing she found herself able to focus on . after that , i could nt very well abandon you to her . i had too much time invested . who knew what foolishness she would end up encouraging you to take on . silly old biddy .  newline newline newline  and as the silly old biddy in question , i stuck around because i got such a cute little goddaughter to teach . and i still need to introduce you to my grandsons , i think i might have just the perfect match now .  newline newline newline the new young witch looked back and forth at the godmothers ,  unable and unwilling to stop her spreading smile .  well , speaking as the one damnable thing ,  i m just happy that i ve had the opportunity to grow up with my granny and nanny . now , where do we begin ? the harsh annoying ring of the telephone pierced his ears , but he was too concentrated to answer it . he had a job to do , and this man was making it very hard to do . even with all the experience he had in finding people , this man was good at not being found . the phone rang again . newline newline he answered it . not out of defeat , but because he just needed a break . in all his research on this man he had hit dead ends .  hello ?  newline newline  yes is this mr nelson ?  it was the voice of a man he did nt recognize , and he was immediately more alert . newline newline  no , you must have a wrong number .  newline newline  i m sorry , let me rephrase that . i know that you are mr nelson , and i need to speak with you . is this line secure ?  newline newline  who the hell are you and what do you want ?  newline newline  mr nelson , this is mr croft , i believe you already know who i am .  newline newline mr nelson chuckled to himself , but his heart raced .  yes i believe i do . but how do you know me , and what is this call concerning ?  newline newline  you and i both know that you were hired by mr spear last week to kill me . what you do nt know is i was also hired by mr spear to kill you .  mr croft let that sink in for a minute before continuing .  we were both paid half before and half after the deed was done , but i have a proposition for you . i would like to meet in person .  newline newline  you must realize that i am not an ignorant man . meeting with you is not in my better judgement , so what s in it for me ?  newline newline  money , if you agree to the plan .  newline newline  and how do i know that you wo nt just kill me and collect your other half ?  newline newline  you do nt . but we are both well seasoned killers . my attacking you would be very stupid , likewise your attacking me would also be very stupid . in killing one another we each collect our other half . in working together we each get much more . i need you , and you need me . so what do you say ?  newline newline he took a moment to digest this and consider his options . he had met only dead ends , and this man already knew his personal phone number . it was in his best interest to not have this man as an enemy .  when and where ?  newline newline  the cafe on 23rd , tomorrow at 3 .  newline newline  that s an awfully crowded place , should nt we meet somewhere more private ?  newline newline  it s so loud , no one will hear us .  newline newline he thought about that and decided the louder the better .  ok.  he hung up . he did nt feel so safe anymore . newline newline he drove past the cafe twice before parking , looking for all the exits , any fast escapes he may find himself in need of . he finally parked and entered . it dawned on him that he had no idea who he was looking for . as he scanned the room a man met his gaze , and held it . mr croft was dressed in jeans and a t shirt , not at all the attire he had imagined him in after the phone call he had had last night . he looked to be in his thirties , and had some slight facial hair . brown eyes , brown hair , everything about this man was extraordinarily average . which is good , when you need to escape notice . he motioned for mr nelson to have the seat directly across from him . newline newline  mr croft .  he nodded curtly and took his seat . newline newline  mr nelson ,  mr croft greeted ,  it s nice to finally meet you .  newline newline nelson cut straight to the chase .  what exactly do you propose .  newline newline  right ,  said croft smiling ,  in short , i propose we blackmail mr spear .  newline newline  why ? why did nt you just kill me ? or blackmail him by yourself ? you must understand this does nt make any sense to me .  newline newline  he hired us to kill each other not because he wants us dead , no , but because he s playing games with us . i take my job very seriously . in fact , it s not just a job , it s a profession , and i am very skilled at it . it s a very serious thing to get involved with a hit man , but he is just using me , using us , for his own amusement . i do nt take lightly to being taken for a fool .  newline newline  how do you propose we blackmail him ?  newline newline  we threaten to kill him , or course . we re both successful murderers who have gotten away countless times . he ll pay us , or he ll die . it s really that simple .  mr nelson did nt speak , obviously wanting mr croft to continue .  we pay a little visit to him while he s home alone . i d say , what ,  10 million each within 24 hours , or we kill him .  newline newline they studied mr spear , learned his habits . the next tuesday they entered his large house while they knew he was sure to be alone . for a rich man mr spear did nt have very good security . they found him in his home office and entered together . mr spear immediately jumped to his feet . newline newline mr croft spoke .  mr spear , we know that you hired us to kill each other , and neither of us likes being played with . so here s what s going to happen . within 24 hours you re going to give us  10 million a piece , or we re going to kill you . do you understand ?  newline newline mr spear was very fat , wearing a suit , and smoking . exactly what you would expect a rich man to look like . except his face was now a bright red , and his eyes were wide with fear . when he spoke his voice was high pitched and drenched with terror .  yyes , how ddo you want mme to give you the money ?  newline newline  you re a very rich man , we ll let you figure that out yourself . we ll be back in 24 hours . it is your job to make sure that there is no one else home at the time , that there are no police involved , and that you have  20 million to give us .  newline newline  ookay .  he nodded quickly , looking as though he had a powerful twitch . newline newline they were leaving when mr croft turned and said  oh , and mr spear ? you would do best not to cross us .  and they left the room . newline newline they returned the following day and the house was empty and clear of police . it appeared as though mr spear had followed his instructions . they found him sitting in his office , but this time he looked much less at ease , and there were two brief cases on his desk . newline newline  very nice mr spear .  said mr croft . they each grabbed one of the brief cases and counted their money . mr croft set down his brief case .  like i said , i do nt like being played with .  and in one fluid motion he drew his gun and shot mr spear . he walked toward the door and when he reached it he turned and said  i hope.i

picked it up and much to his delight it was a  20 bill ! he called his friend over and they thought that there might be more to come so they searched around . eventually it started to get dark so they decided to start walking home . walking along the footpath , keem heard a rustling in the trees , at first he passed it off as a squirrel but the sound got much louder gradually , a sound that could only come from something much bigger than a squirrel . terrified , they started walking faster and faster eventually running . the beast was black , not furry , but more of a silhouette . it let out a mighty roar . in a frenzy to get out , keem s friend tripped , although scared for his life he did nt want to leave her behind he grabbed her hand and while standing up , they noticed the beast had lost sight of them . they made it out of the woods and upon returning home keem was asked what happened . still shaken , up the only words he could muster were  i found a dollar and the woods and it feels so good ! when i was little , i was afraid of people , no rather that i was afraid of talking to people , so i pushed them away . i did this for years , until noone wanted to talk to me . it was lonely , i saw how people looked so happy together , but groups , no they were too terrifying ... one day i had decided to try and talk to someone , to see if i could try to speak again , but it did nt work . i tried and tried again , i thought they were just ignoring me , but they were nt , i have nt been able to speak to you people for countless years , i ve tried and tried , screaming from the top of my lungs  look at me somebody look at me ... please , i m so lonely  and every once in a while some one turns , but no one listens . so i watch , and i wait , and i call out , until the day someone can see me . hello fair hero ! perhaps you could help me with a problem . press x  newline  there are a group of rats attacking my vegetables ! kill them and i will give you a prize ! press x  newline newline the young hero trudged off to my backyard , awkwardly hacking away at the low level rates by the squash . it warmed my heart a bit seeing the young man trying to defeat the vermin , learning how to swing his sword , taking 1 point of damage from a rat bite , and howling with victory when a meager foe was slain . the young adventurer , doe eyed and flush with the thrill of battle , returned to me . newline newline  bless you fair hero ! have a life potion to soothe you wounds !  newline newline he graciously accepted and went on his way . soon he would be slaying monsters and dragons , saving the world . newline newline another hero came forward . he sprinted to me in a straight line . oh bestus , i knew the type . newline newline  hello fair hero . perhaps you could help  newline  there are a group of rats attacking my veg  newline newline off he went . the rats fell easily . straight back to me . newline newline  bless you fair  newline newline he snatched the potion , walked a few feet , fiddled with his bag , and tossed the potion aside with a grunt , stalking into thom  s shop . he exited , picked up the potion , stuck it in his bag , and walked off . newline newline i saw it every day . heroes who looked young but knew exactly what to do , doing it out of habit  soulless young ones without a hint of adventure . newline newline another approached . newline  hel  newline  there  newline not even a pause . no love for the lore of it all , not a care for where the rats came from , or what my issue was . newline  bl  and off he went . his bad was bulging with potions . he tried to stuff another in , and it fell back out . he picked it up and repeated this several times . the hero , exasperated , tossed the potion back at me . it fell pitifully at my feet . newline newline this was all a bit too much . these weren  t heroes , these were beasts . beasts with no care of the world around them , simply going from point to point in service to some imaginary goal . they didn  t care if the world was dying , they only cared about amassing wealth or claiming some lost artifact they could shut away . newline the horizon was clear for the moment no heroes or beasts were within the town gates . i picked up the discarded potion and walked into my backyard to check on my constant adversary , the rats . free for the moment from their yolk of hero fodder they played . over and over they attacked and fell to the sword , only to be reborn again . now they enjoyed a brief respite , squeaking and grunting . these rats found more joy in life than the beasts ever would . newline newline a rat ran over to me and sniffed at the potion i held . it looked at me thoughtfully . i had no use for the extra potion  my stock replenished itself automatically . typically i collected the extras and gave them to the town goblin , garret . garret would place them in pots and bushed throughout the town and surrounding area for heroes to find . newline newline perhaps i could do something different with this one . i uncorked the top and poured a little onto the rat in front of me . the rat looked at me curiously , and ran off to play with his friends . newline newline i sat the open potion on the ground and returned to the front . there had to be something i could do to teach these beasts posing as heroes their proper place . it would be noble of me , in fact , to waken them from there lifeless slumber and engage them with the world around them . newline newline another hero approached . he had little time for conversation , and headed to the back . he was a newer hero , all in cloth armour with a wooden sword . he fought absentmindedly with the rats , taking some small amount of damage . when the last rat fell , he seemed a little stronger . a little faster . a little smarter . i offered a new potion and he took it without thought and drank it . his wounds , a scratch or two , disappeared and off he went . newline newline an idea struck me . i was but a village homeowner , living my life in a perpetual state of weakness . the heroes that came through occasionally changed . when they fought , they got stronger . when they one , they improved even more . while i would never change , perhaps the rats could . newline newline after the next hero beast left , i ran to the backyard . the rats where spread about in pieces . i ran over to one and poured the potion over him nothing happened . a few moments later they all regained life , all the same as they where before . a toubling set back . newline newline that night garret came to me asking for any extra potions . i had a dozen or so that i had collected in a barrel behind the stove . i pretended to search for them , using the opportunity to question garret . it would be morning before i would once again entertain heroes , and i was fortunate enough to have a lock on my door . now i wanted to make a plan . newline newline  garret ,  i said ,  the oddest thing happened today . where are those cursed potions ? i was in the back with an open potion some hero had left behind , and some fell on a rat body . it did not heal him as it does heroes . no , not under here either . why do you suppose that is ? newline newline garret looked at me with some seriousness .  you should not be playing with them rats , gorl . tis no good to truck with things you do not understand.  newline newline  my friend , i have no idea what you mean . i was simply describing a strange accident.  newline newline  and i  m blestus hisself . leave them rats alone or no good  ll come of it . let the bleedin heroes come by an massacre  em as they like . the rats come back , and they don  t seem to mind it too much.  newline newline  of course , of course dear garret . you mistake me . i only wonder why it did no good to the lowly vermin when it does so much for heroes ?  newline newline garret sighed and sat on my wooden stool .  i see i  ll not be getting my potions fore you get your answers . heroes come through here never dies , only gets bit up a bit by them rats . rats do die , only temporary like . rats come back though . up in wandering woods , though , they have to deal with forrest goblins . ugly and mean with a taste for hero . garth , me cousin , does a bit of work up there . he says when heroes fall they got to use a white crystal to get up again.  newline newline  ah , a white crystal . hmm , i can  t say that i  ve ever seen one ,  i replied . newline newline  nor will ya . white crystal are hard to come by in these parts . not for pots , that  s for sure . i seen some at thoms , where he makes a good bit of coin for  em , buts that  s it.  newline newline  wonderful . i mean , curious . well , here they are ! about a dozen today . take them with my thanks for the shared words , garret.  newline newline  good then . i tell you , gorl , you  d best leave whatever you  re planning alone . let they heroes do their bloody work and rest when you can . there  s not much joy in this life , but there is sunshine and a cool breeze . that  s better than a forrest goblin gets , and you should be thankful.  newline newline with that he was off . newline newline the next morning was flush with beasts , all slaying and swinging , all in too much of a hurry to let me give them so much as a complete thought or thank you . there was an ebb in the afternoon , and i wandered over to thom  s shop . thom stood stoically within , his grizzled face scowling behind his counter . newlinein a black lacquer box , preserved neatly and cleanly , there is an ancient scroll . on it , an ancient prophecy foretells the arrival of a man of great supernatural power . he would be born with the ability to speak to all the mystical animals of japan . his arrival would bring a return of japan to a more natural , harmonious state . newline newline he would speak to the kitsune , the shapeshifting foxes , and bring on the rains .

nt always be content to throw your clothes on the floor and otherwise live in chaos .  newline newline  i know where everything is .  she rolled her eyes at me . newline newline  my spare bedroom is down that hall , the one that is nt a bathroom . we have to share that , i m afraid . so please do nt do anything evil or disgusting , i remember what we were like at your age .  newline newline she did nt deign to respond . she shouldered the heavy duffle bag and made her way into my spare bedroom . newline newline  are you certain that your er ... knowledge of this whole time travel business wo nt do any harm in the long run ?  newline newline  uh , hello , dr. who . besides , you look like me . i m not stupid . are you ?  newline newline she raised her eyebrows and pursed her lips at me . and then she started to strip off her jeans right there with me still standing in the room . i flushed furiously and turned away . sure it was my body but still , i was an intensely private person . it seemed like i had always been this way but apparently that was nt the case . newline newline she brushed past me wearing black and white rectangle patterned hammer pants . i groaned . i had forgotten about those god awful things . i followed her , noticing that she had a large yellow gameboy in one hand , to the couch where she flopped down and kicked her feet up over the arm rest . i sighed . newline newline  do nt you want to call dad ?  i asked , raising my voice in tandem with her dialing up the volume on her gameboy . i remembered being cute and bookish as a kid , oh how memories lie . newline newline  nope ,  she popped the p  and did nt bother looking up . newline newline  you know , he s not always going to be around ...  i drew off , angry now . i did nt want to

. ugh , i was so not good with kids . newline newline  you call him then ,  she sounded bored but i knew that she was just trying to shut me out , to protect herself .  he did nt want us anyways , why do you care ?  newline newline  that s not true ! he he did the best he could but with joyce reaming him out for alimony there was nt much he could ve done !  i could feel my face turning red . how

sounding genuinely curious . newline newline  nevermind that . i m not sure how much i should be telling you , i do nt want to go changing things willy nilly without any understanding of the potential consequences .  newline newline  things are already changing , i m not going to grow up into you ,  her voice softened momentarily ,  it s going to be okay . but seriously though i do nt get why you wo nt like ... buy some important stocks or write a hit song or something . i would nt be happy being a lawyer .  newline newline  call dad , would you ?  i asked , barely audible . she sighed and took the cordless phone i handed to her . i was nt heartless , after all . newline newline did i want her to turn out like me ? i had done remarkably well for myself considering everything , that s

of juvi every other month . newline newline the end product might be okay but ... was i really happy ? i had dragged myself up from rock bottom to get where i am today . but it was nt easy or fast or fun . could i save myself , her , from all of that ? should i ? newline newline i glanced over my shoulder and tip toed into her room . i found one shoe by the door and another under the bed . i rooted through her bag briefly before removing the pair that she d stuffed in the bottom of it . there would be no running away now . i checked the top shelf of the closet just to be sure she had nt stashed anything up there . all clear . newline newline i hid her shoes in my room and paced back towards the living room trying to look casual . she looked up at me with innocent dark eyes and

with the makeup on ? newline newline i have , and it was terrible . i live in an apartment building with my mom , and across the hall there s this man who s a professional clown . i had never seen him without makeup on , because he usually only came out of his apartment to do his clowning job . newline newline mom once told me that this clown was a war veteran , and she wondered how an respectable solider like that could end up being a performing clown . she seemed to think that the whole thing was just so sad and terrible for some reason . but that was probably because she did nt think clowning was a respectable profession . newline newline however i thought the guy was pretty good at clowning , because he had a way of making me laugh ... and his jokes were just so funny ! he was like the best clown ever . newline newline there was a long stretch of time when i did nt get to see him on the way out to school or on the way back home ... so i started to miss his jokes and the way he did that silly dance . newline newline so on the weekend i went over to his apartment door and knocked . the door was unlocked , so it opened up a crack when i knocked on the door . so i simply opened the door and went in , despite the fact that i was nt supposed to go into others  apartments without permission . newline newline that was when i saw him without his makeup on . he was in the kitchen making food , and was unaware of the fact that i had entered his apartment . but i made some sound , and so as an result he turned around ... revealing all of the scars on his face . newline newline his face was so scarred that it basically looked as if he had a very deformed face . it actually frightened me a lot at the time ... and i honestly thought for a moment there that some scary stranger had came in and took over my beloved clown s apartment . newline newline but then he spoke with the same guttural voice that i often associated with my clown . newline that was when i knew that this scarred stranger and my clown were the same person . newline newline he asked me what i was doing in his apartment , and the first thing i could think to say was this :  why do you look so different without your make up ?  newline newline he explained to me about putty makeup and how that could cover up anything ... even deep scars . and then he went to get my mom . newline newline my mom scolded me so much , and told me that i was not to go into other people s apartments again . newline afterwards all i could think about was how horrible my clown s face looked under that makeup . and the more i visualized his face , the more monstrous it looked ... newline newline and it honestly creeped me out how he could wear makeup like a mask to hide his damaged face . it got me thinking about all the other clowns out there ... were their faces horribly disfigured too ? were all the clowns just hiding their true selves behind makeup ? newline newline i used to love clowns a lot ... but ever since that day when i saw my beloved clown s true face ... . i do nt love them much as i used to . mo .  i rub my eyes with my hand .  it s four in the morning . you have not teleported . it s just a dream .  newline newline the line crackled as mo let out an exasperated sigh .  no , becks . that s the thing . it s actually real !  newline newline  okay .  in my halfwaking state , i was willing to humor her .  tell me what happened , then . how did you finally manage to crack this code ?  newline newline  well , you know how i ve been trying to get to the park bench for a while now ?  newline newline a while ? try four years .  i bit back the sarcastic comment .  yes .  newline newline  since that s been a total bust so far , i decided i should try out different locations . i thought , maybe the issue is nt that i m trying to go to far . maybe it s that i m not going far enough .   newline newline  what ?  i sat up in bed .  what are you talking about ?  newline newline mo giggled .  guess where i am right now .  newline newline  paris ? i do nt know .  newline newline  nope .  she sounded so giddy . it was really throwing me .  i m in ...  she cut herself off with another laugh .  the outer stratosphere .  newline newline i hesitated .  you ... what ?  newline newline  i m almost up in space .  a breeze rushed by , causing a ripple of static .  oh man , i think i m going to try for the moon .  newline newline i froze .  the moon ?  newline newline  would nt that be crazy ?   newline newline  do nt do it !  i blurted out . newline newline mo paused .  what ?  newline newline  um ...  inspiration hit me .  i mean , do nt do it yet .  could you , uh , facetime me ? right now ? i want to see the view from up where you are .  newline newline  oh ! sure . hold on .  newline newline the line went silent for a moment . i chewed my knuckle , heart racing . come on ,  i prayed . call back . come on .  newline newline finally , my phone rang again . i breathed a sigh of relief as i saw that it was indeed a facetime request from mo s number . i hit accept , and mo s face appeared on my screen . newline newline  hi !  she exclaimed . her brown eyes shifted back and forth quickly , and her short hair was a mess of tangled clumps . there were wrinkles at the edges of her lips , and dark circles underneath her eyes . she reminded me of a rabid animal .  here you go ! take a look !  she held the phone away from her and spun around in a slow circle .  is nt it amazing ?  newline newline  it is ,  i agreed , scrutinizing the view as best as i could . in a few seconds i realized that she was downtown , at the top of the hilton . the very top . the roof . newline newline  i m very impressed ,  i told her . newline newline  i got ta go .  she brought the phone back to her face .  i m gon na try for the moon .  newline newline  no !   i exclaimed .  um . can you wait one second ? i want to ... show you something before you go .  newline newline  oh .  mo seemed surprised .  okay . where is it ?  newline newline  i have to hang up and get it . can i call you back ?  newline newline  sure !  even with the delay in her plans , she was still beyond excited .  do nt take too long !  newline newline i hung up and quickly dialed rei s number . to my relief , she picked up . newline newline  it s four in the morning ,  she snapped by way of greeting . newline newline  rei , it s time ,  i told her .  we need to get mo some help .  what thehey ! what are you  newline newline the tall , heavily armoured man swiveled away from the chest to face me in the blink of an eye , his effeminate hair still swaying from the motion long after he stopped . newline newline  hey man look , i do nt want any trouble .  i whimpered , eyeing that sword strapped to his back , easily three times his size . newline newline  but this is my ... guards involved ... seek ... lest ... wait what ?  i stood for a second in confusion , unsure of what just popped out of my mouth . newline newline the man casually jogged around me , smashing furniture left and right while peeking into containers . newline newline  oh , i see . you re the player character right ? that s why you can skip my dia  i was cut off again , seemed this player was nt interested in immersion . newline newline  okay , well how about this ?  i broke out my trump card , even the player was nt immune to this . newline newline in a short , somewhat jarring motion , the player was warped right in front of me . i could see he had some minor control over himself , but only enough to twist around , not enough to ignore me and move on . newline newline  that s right .  i said with a small hint of pride . newline newline  unskippable dialogue .  i added as i watched him squirm . it felt good to have control over something in my life for a change , especially over the guy the world revolves around . newline newline  we npcs get a few of these so folks like you do nt miss out on the important stuff . now , i get that you re off on your big quest and everything , but cmon man . do you really need to loot my stash of shplurfroot ? the best thing you can craft from that is a potion that heals like , 10 hp . i need to use that stuff to craft my ointment for this direwolf injury i got last week . between you and me , i do nt even think the game s been out that long , some jerk just decided to code me this way to add depth .  newline newline i could see the player was actually paying attention to me for a change . his character stopped twitching and just stared at me with these cold , dead eyes while his clenched fists dangled at his sides . i was nt sure what to expect when i saw him open up his list of emoticons . newline newline to my surprise he used the  point up  gesture . i turned around to see what he was pointing at but only saw the remains of my bookshelf he d smashed and pillaged . i then realized he was pointing at the text above my head . newline newline looking up , it was hard to read at this angle , but i d already figured it out a while ago with the help of a few mirrors . it read :  joe . lv7 commonor , 190 hp .  newline newline having a glitched perception stat had it s ups and downs . having 2020 vision and a 100  hit rate was nice and all , but the existential dread that comes from seeing the world for what it is can really weigh on you . newline newline i at least thought being a self aware ai in a game would be a big deal to this player , but he just seemed to brush it off . he followed up with the  this guy  gesture , pointing both his thumbs to himself . i took a quick peek at his stat page .  tyrannosaurus flex lv20 dragon berserker . 6900 hp .  newline newline  okay , like i said , i get that you re an important person and everything but i really do need those roots . surely you do nt need it , it ll barely heal your hp and the merchants will only pay around 6g for something like that .  i d hoped my pleading would resonate with him , npcs are only given a few lines of unskippable dialogue at a time , so that was my last shot . newline newline i saw him select the  handshake  gesture . with a sigh of relief , i reached out to him . then , he did a quick backstep action , cancelling the animation . quickly shifted over to the  flip off  gesture , and did a dodge roll straight through my window . i quickly ran over to the window to see him sprinting off my lawn , slowly stopping to regain his stamina every few seconds . newline newline  oh yeah ! ?  i called out . newline newline  you know that chick down at the bar you keep giving stuff to ? guess what buddy , her affection meter raises towards anyone who gives her things ! right now , your waifu s probably getting it on with the shopkeep that sold you that sword at double it s value !  newline newline newline all set ?  cassandra , the love of my life asks me . newline newline  yep , car s all packed sweetheart ,  i tell her . newline newline  good , now let s enjoy this honeymoon of ours ,  she says and kisses me on the lips before heading out to the car . i grab my cellphone off the kitchen counter and make a call . newline newline  hey , i have that package you ordered that was shipped to my house . i m headed into town , it okay if i bring it by ?  i ask . newline newline  yeah , i ll be waiting ,  the other man replies and hangs up . i put my phone in my pocket and head out to the car . newline newline  hey , if it s okay , i m going to crash until we get there ,  cassandra informs me upon me sitting down in the driver s seat . newline newline  okay love ,  i reply and kiss her on the forehead . the ninety minute drive goes by silently , and once again the familiar skyline of new york greets me . it takes another forty five minutes to get into the city proper . finally , i arrive at a more quaint section and pull the car into an alleyway . a man in a dark suit comes out of the shadows as i park . newline newline  hey , what s going on sweetheart ?  cassandra asks me worriedly . newline newline  stat here a second ,  i request and get out , meeting the man . newline newline  do you have it ?  he asks me . newline newline  right here ,  i reply and pop the trunk , helping him remove the heroin i transported here . we go back around front where cassandra gets out of the car . newline newline  alan , what the hell is going on ?  she asks me . newline newline  detective riley , nypd ,  the man in the suit flashes his badge . newline newline  you son of a bitch , you just sold illegal drugs to a cop on our honeymoon ?  cassandra snaps . newline newline  sweetheart , there s something about me you do nt know ,  i tell her . newline newline  i do nt want to hear it ,  she hisses . i dig around in my pocket . newline newline  i m detective alan wheeler , nypd ,  i state ,  and you just helped me get the evidence into town that will seal a prominent drug ring in jail for a very long time .  newline newline  you ve been lying to me the whole time ?  she asks , hurt . newline newline  no , you truly are the love of my life , and marrying you while undercover was the hardest decision of my life , but doing so saved my life , it explained my recent nervousness while undercover ,  i explain ,  you saved me .  cassandra sighs and runs her hands through her hair . newline newline  one last thing alan ,  cassandra states . newline newline  yes my dear ?  i ask . newline newline  this save was a one time , when you re getting shot at , you re on your own , because i d probably end up killing you if i was on your side ,  she declares . newline newline  by accident or on purpose ?  i ask . newline newline  that , my dear boy , remains to be determined .  newline newlinethe skirmish had raged for days , devolving into a battle , dragging through the nights and spilling into the next dawn , roaring its way as the sun crashed below the horizon and so forth . as fires burned and the debris crackled under heat of hungry orange flames , the wounded howled out for mercy . the fastest participant on any battlefield is death and his attention is endless , his appetite for work never satisfied . valiant riders were scattered about the endless charred black that seemed to reach out in all directions  it was as if the whole place were some inescapable crater that tapped on hell s ceiling . the heavy bodies of onyx or golden dragons were heaped in random , littering piles . ray stumbled through the smokey haze , her footing betraying her as she slipped on ashen piles or bloody slicks . she d never known how much the mighty beasts could bleed . newline newline her voice had failed her completely , she was nt sure if it had fallen away because of all the smoke or simply the effort of shouting during combat . she could not speak above a weak whisper . her ankles and knees hurt from the fall , kahshrah had taken care to dip as lowly as he could before she d fallen off . she was nt quite sure how her old friend had simply known she was injured before she had realized it herself , but kahshrah had been her older brother s battledragon before , it was possible he was just more acutely aware than she could fathom . her chest ached worse than her knees and ankles and her vision was become a daze from time to time . ray reached a hand past her armpit , wriggling it into the space between chestplate and chest , fingertips probing at the sopping wound beneath . the armor had done its job of keeping the impact from piercing her , but her flesh had still welted and ripped some , her fingers came back with a light red hue . newline newline  shh . i m here . i m right here ...  the deep and melodious tone was unmistakable , even among the chaotic din of post battlefield horrors . newline newline ray half stumbled , half fell as she spun on her heels to face her closest friend . kahshrah s wings carefully and elegantly folded against his body as he crawled foward to his belly , head lowering and nose pushing up into ray s chest . his nostrils flared in a loud sniff , the smell of her blood filling his mind . his eyes swirled in his head as he angled his long face to peer at her with his fullest expression . dragon s always seemed to have a sort of permanent grimace with their edged and toothy jaws , but kahshrah s features always reminded ray of her dogs from shepherding . the wide and toothy smile of man s best friend looked exactly the same over kahshrah s near endless face . newline newline his deep tone resonated and vibrated in her belly ,  you re hurt . can you ride ?  newline newline she had fallen off her dragon hours ago . the fighting on the ground had been even bloodier than the combat in the skies . managing to hide from bloody scene to ever more impossibly murderous moment had taken an obvious toll and her eyes showed the exhaustion of days full of endless fatigue . her hands reached out and she clutched onto her friend s face , barely holding in the sobs she wished she had the energy to release . kahshrah s heavy head gently pushed back to her for support , the smell of her wounds both enraging and worrying him in a fervor of conflicting emotions . he was no stranger to war , and neither was her brother , but they had both hoped she would nt come to this world . he felt as though he d failed his old friend , not just by letting her get hurt , not just by almost losing her among the brawl , but simply by allowing her to have joined it in the first place . newline newline it was no matter . she had lashed with gun and sword with every bit of tenacity and fervor as expected of house hrothgar , her brother would have been every bit as proud of her as she always was of him . kahshrah unfurled his wings and brought them forward of his body , shielding his closest living friend from the horrors of the world they were rulers in . no one understood how close the friendships forged in fire and blood could be , and no one ever would until they experienced them too . he would eventually help her to climb onto her saddle or he would clutch her carefully in his bladed talons , but he would bring her back to the apothecaries . his only worry was that she would see his wounds and forget the severity of hers , but in a strange way he cherished that concern . newline newline perhaps he thought , i m more wounded . perhaps she s worried in the same way as me ... in the dead of night , our helicopters flew low over the eerily dark complex . dorms , factories , and office buildings stood in ruin , illuminated only by the crescent moon . our six helicopters touched down in a perimeter around the city  my fellow soldiers and i leapt out into the freezing air . there was a scent of burning garbage in the air . bits of snow were falling from the perfectly clear sky ... or was it ash ? newline newline   team bravo , take the two workshops and move in through the dorm towards the center tower . over .   newline newline the radio clicked off and the helicopters left . we were on our own . newline newline six of us circled the back door of the lifeless workshop and sergeant stravinsky breached it . we scanned the inside with the flashlights at the end of our rifles . there was no evidence of life  only death . chunks of frozen visceral matter covered the floor and walls . elves and pieces of elves were everywhere , frozen stiff : trapped in machines , halfway through lathes , mechanically extruded , etc . it was a truly horrendous sight . newline newline we began to take notice of how terrible the working conditions here must have been . tiny 4x4x6 boxes were the working space for one worker , with no guaranteed breaks and a 12hour workday minimum . there were piles of frozen fecal matter and what appeared to be urine , and although we could nt be sure how old they were , the lack of bathrooms in the building assured us that they probably outdated the corpses . newline newline we left the workshop and headed into the twostory elf dorm , sweeping the lower hallway before going room to room . many were empty . i broke the flimsy wooden door to one room and bent down to enter , finding to my horror a male and female elf that had apparently stripped and killed themselves in some sort of sadistic ritual . scanning upstairs we found something far different  here the floor of the dark hallway was covered with dead elves , who appeared to have been lined up and systematically shot with a single bullet to the head . at the end of the hallway we found one elf barely recognizable  we assumed he had tried to run away . newline newline as we left the dorm and approached the center of town , a heavy black smoke filled the air , smelling this time of burning flesh . we met up with the six other teams outside the massive red and white tower in the center of the city , where the smoke was coming from . our goal was to get to the penthouse , grab the target , and wait on the roof for extraction . newline newline surrounding the tower were elf bodies , thousands of them . many were still clutching protest signs . rabid reindeer were feasting on their bodies , some still warm . i sniffed . newline newline  you smell that ?  i asked . newline newline  what ? you mean the smoke ?  the sergeant replied . newline newline  no , it smells almost like ...  i trailed off as we all noticed the subtle scent of cyanide gas . newline newline  gas masks on , boys ,  the sergeant ordered . newline newline i reached into my pack and put the mask over my face , then wrapped the rest of my head back up in the scarf it had been in before . we waded through the kneedeep carnage as we approached the building . suddenly , there was an explosion from about halfway up . i ran  some froze . huge chunks of sheet metal and glass fell and crushed at least a dozen men . sergeant stravinsky was trapped under a large metal sheet . newline newline  get im out ! get im out !  newline newline everyone rushed to the scene , but it did nt look good . everything from his stomach down had been crushed  his blood was already beginning to freeze his lower ribs to the metal . he screamed for a bit . his friend , sergeant holst , ran to his side . newline newline  igor ! igor , we re going to get you out of here , okay ? just stay with us ,  he said . newline newline  no you re not . it s sixty below and i m trapped under ten tons of steel surrounded by dead elves . it s not a conventional way to go , but i ll take it ,  the sergeant replied . newline newline he reached down to his utility belt , pulled up his combat knife , and cut his own throat . nobody stopped him  nobody really tried to stop him . the ground commander radioed back to command . newline newline  we re taking heavy casualties , over ? heavy casualties !  newline newline  say again , over ?  newline newline  heavy casualties . we ve got ten guys dead , a dozen or so wounded . there is active combat surrounding the tower , over .  newline newline  we can not extract you right now . black hawks under heavy turbulence from incoming blizzard . you ll have to wait it out , over .  newline newline the co was about to reply when he was interrupted by another soldier . newline newline  sir , target spotted !  newline newline we all turned our eyes to the skies , where the massive sleigh had just taken off from the roof of the tower . it flew around the city , dropping giftshaped bombs on the buildings and headed our way . newline newline  shoot it down .  newline newline our three specialists raised their rpgs to the sky and fired . one missed , one hit a reindeer , and one struck the bottom of the sleigh , setting off some of the bombs and sending the whole thing into a tailspin , crashing into the tower several stories up with a hollywoodstyle explosion . newline newline  into the tower ! go , go !  newline newline we all rushed the tower , tripping over frozen and notsofrozen elves as we ran up eight flights of stairs . up here the cyanide was mixed with chlorine and smoke . the outside of my armor began to peel as we headed towards the crash site , but we were nt the first ones there . i was one of the first around the corner to find a detachment of about eighty elves , mostly armed , waiting there . they saw me first and began shooting . i jumped back around the corner , waited for some others to join me , and turned around shooting blindly into the crowd . i used my final ten bullets on this one elf , who was really persistent . newline newline all was said and done within fortyfive seconds , and i found myself with a bullet wound on my left arm that i had nt even noticed . it was nt too bad , just a graze , but i was bleeding profusely . i grabbed a frozen light fixture off the wall and stuck it in my wound  it stuck instantly , sealing the blood inside . we approached the crash site and found nothing short of some twisted metal and a burned christmas hat . our work here was done . newline newline the helicopters were able to come in quickly before the blizzard hit  one went down during the escape and was quickly captured by a swarm of over two thousand elves . i took the starboard gun and opened fire on the swarm , taking down a whole bunch but still hardly making a dent in the population . we did nt have the resources to rescue our men . newline newline of course , we could nt let word of this stand , so planes on standby flew in from greenland and nuked the whole village . it was a beautiful site from the qaanaq base , with the colors and the clouds ... absolutely beautiful . the soldiers officially died when a helicopter went missing over the north pole , a helicopter which would never be found despite a mediahyped search . the heat spike was to be blamed on global warming  the radiation on a north korean nuclear test that would be announced the following morning . newline newline as for santa , we got this old guy from vermont to take his place .it was summer and i had been with friends on a party down by the beach . we live in a very warm part of australia , and we loved it . i still lived at home with my mom and dad , and i loved living , i had two siblings  one older brother , who was with me at the party , and one older sister , who was at home with her baby . newline i didn  t have a boyfriend at the time , and sometimes that made me really depressed , and two weeks earlier , before the party , i had been thinking about killing myself . newline  hey , willow , come on !  , my brother , sam , yelled after me . newline  hold on , i  ll be right there !  newline  come here , willow !  , sam said and grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me against his chest and hugged me hard .  happy birthday..  newline newline the hours went by , and we started drinking heavily , and i couldn  t control myself . i had no sense of direction or coordination . newline  come on , let  s jump into the water !  , i heard myself say . newline i had never been that kind of person to go swimming , and i wasn  t even sure if i could swim , it was that long ago . newline we ran out to the dock , and i stopped dead . newline  come on , you  re not chicken , are you ?  , they said and started laughing at me . they started pushing and i started screaming . newline  come on , stop it !  , sam screamed and they started pushing and grabbing and pulling and then someone accidently pushed me into the water . newline my body went down first and it was cold . no , it wasn  t cold , it was freezing . the stream was pulling me away from the dock and i could hear sam screaming after me . i pulled myself to the surface , and everything was going so fast and i couldn  t move . newline  sam ! please save me !  , i screamed . newline i could see how they all stood and watched as i went further down the ups and downs of the ocean . i hit my head on a rock and i went under the surface again . newline everything was still and quite and i could no longer move . blood was running down my face and i started to panic . what if no one found me ? was i going to die right here ? newline i was thinking about a good memory , about when i was younger . it was when i learned how to ride my bike . i had fallen down , and my older sister , shannon , as she loved children , ran up to me and got me up from the ground.. when we were older , like now , we would go to parties together and she would always take care of me and take me away from boys who were just after me to have sex with me . newline my brother was a different thing . we had a deep connection to eachother and he was the best brother you could ever have . he would usually take the blame for my misdoings and defend me from when my mom and dad was fighting . newline i had failed my older brother and my sister and her son and mom and dad if i didn  t get out of the water now . i was never going to see them again . not if i tried to move . newline i opened my eyes . come on , get out of the water . you  ve got to get out of the water , somehow . move . move ! ! newline i could nt do anything , and my time was running out . i was slowly sinking , and i was struck by the thought that i was never going to be found . i was going to sink to the bottom and then it would take weeks before someone found me . newline i felt terrible . i felt sick . newline they were never going to find me . my body floated down the sea with my face down in the water . my body floated away to a distant place were no one would ever find me .i enjoyed your story , it had an alice in wonderland feel to it . newline newline the sentence  i was outside  did you mean to imply that your character quickly run out of the building through the orange door or rather the moment the disheveled man entered the room he suddenly found himself outside the building ? newline newline i think you need to work on your punctuation and sentence structures , sometimes i had to read a sentence twice to understand it yet i enjoyed doing that because it reminded me of the writing style of haruki murakami . i do nt know if that was the intended effect but i enjoyed it all the same . newline newline hope to read more of your works .garland sighed and sat back in his chair . newline newline two thousand years . it had been a number of millenia since the big guy and his council left , leaving garland and a few angels back on earth . an angel himself , time was but another measurement to be disregarded , but in order to oversee this world , he had had his own perception of it twisted . to him , these last centuries had been felt as a human would . newline newline boring . newline newline garland sighed again and rose from his seat . a bath , maybe ? or would he try out that new game bethesda had come up with . he had to admit that this job got considerably less boring in the last few decades . still boring , but ... tolerable . a faint mewling sounded from across the room and garland glanced over at his cat . it sat curled up on the couch , its face scrunching up in different ways . it was having a dream . newline newline he cast his gaze about him . to any onlooker that manged to breach this realm , he was standing atop an invisible floor , amidst the clouds and skies . a desk sat with him in the sky , along with a couch , a tv , consoles , a shower ... newline newline a bachelor pad him the sky . garland smiled . newline newline master garland ?  newline newline garland s smile disappeared . the question resonating in his head was that of kinny , earth risk manager . as much as garland enjoyed kinny s company , there could only be one reason for his intrusion . newline newline  you may enter .  newline newline kinny materialized just a few feet in front of garland , looking flustered . kinny took the form of a young man , about the age of nineteen , though he was much older . he had long blonde hair that fell in a mess around his head , and two golden eyes stricken with worry . newline newline  is it them again ?  garland asked , already knowing the answer . newline newline  your intuition is correct .  newline newline garland closed his eyes and said a prayer under his breath . prayers were , of course , useless . not that his master could nt , or would nt , do anything with them . just that that s not how anything got done in his business . if he wanted to contact the big guy himself , he d simply call the line . prayers were simply a thing he gave his subjects to alleviate their fears a bit . it verified itself off chance . humans know it wo nt work every time they pray , but it is affirmed on the small chance that it does work . at this point , for garland , saying a prayer was akin to speaking a curse , or running his hand through his hair . a tick one does with worry . newline newline  you know , kinny , you d think after almost two thousand years of war , poverty , and human foolishness , you d get used to it all . but you do nt . it just gets worse , and worse , and it does nt get any better .  garland rubbed his temples .  how long will it take them to get tired of fighting ? of murder ?  garland shook his head and turned away from kinny . newline newline  what are the specifics , then ?  newline newline kinny frowned at garland .  probably one of the bigger hits by isis to date . they ... they rounded up a lot of people . unbelievers , homosexuals ... children . almost a thousand , sir . and ... and ...  newline newline  that s enough , kinny . you may return to your quarters .  newline newline garland could hear kinny sniff .  thank you , sir .  newline newline after a few moments , garland could feel kinny s presence disappear . he wrung his head . newline newline it was an honorable job , being the earth s warden . a successful world would bring him favor and respect in the master s eyes , but ... newline newline why did he have to have empathy ? newline newline why did he have to care about these humans ? every death , he felt in his heart . every misdeed , every perverted action . he felt it like a punch to the face . he knew that god felt it even more . newline newline so why did god let it exist like this ? why did nt he intervene like he used to , before he left ? he told garland to stay his hand , and ... newline newline garland frowned . god used to intervene , before he left . he used to work wonders and change the course of history . then he left . he left , and he left garland in charge . garland had always taken it as a babysitting job , without the need to intervene . that s how all the best world watchers did it , with all of god s other creations . but ... newline newline garland smiled . he did nt have to let it be like this . he did nt have to be like the other watchers . he did nt have to let bad men get away with bad deeds . he did nt have to feel the anguish of a million souls every day . he could help them . newline newline he heard a meow from his couch . the cat had gotten up and stretched , its yawn silently judging garland . garland glared at it . newline newline  i can help these people . they ask me for it !  newline newline the cat closed its mouth and stared at garland , blinking slowly . newline newline  okay , fine , they ask for god . but for all they care , i am their god , right ? i m the only one in any position to help them . and that i would nt ...  newline newline garland curled his hand up into a fist .  i might as well be on of those animals .  newline newline the cat blinked and curled back up into a ball , going back to sleep . newline newline  sorry , not animal . demons . those demons .  he glanced at the endless floor in thought , then back at computer .  very well . i shall help them . i can not be brash , however . every action has a reaction . i ca nt just walk in guns ablazing , eh ?  newline newline the cat did nt respond . newline newline garland rolled his eyes at it , and sat down at the computer . a picture of the leaders of isis showed up at his thought , and suddenly information about them began scrolling through the computer . locations , names , ip addresses . newline newline garland grinned wolfishly . newline newline  this ,  he announced ,  will be an entertaining millenia .  newlineborn under the star of the second god saregotoh he witnessed the birth of the ninth lover of morning . his mind , unended by the words of a false king of indecent utopia , reflected in the opal splatter across the pillow . her eye was the other key in comparison to the aforementioned mind . newline newline afternoon ? newline newline 10pm . the sky is painted in lunacy . at this moment , recharged by moonlight , he exits the bed and walks into the hallway where the ostentatious parodie of human flesh once walked . he seeks the eye he witnesses in darkness , and that which those whomst d whisper about in the crimson tone . newline newline i enter the picture . i present him with the third and unmentioned key . it is the foot . he shrieks in a screech that hints at a certain vermillion expression . i am unfazed . i return to the wall . newline newline she wakes up and sees her eye . she plucks it out with the grace of the beloved catfisherman , and adds it to the pile . the pile amalgamates and returns to the key that was the three . thunderclap . newline newline saregotoh returns to the third members mentality .death had been getting lazy these past few centuries . that s the bottom line here , ever since the age of exploration deaths job got easier as being able to recruit minions to do his job was his most ideal option . now that his work had become a well oiled machine death , simply wandered about his world alone . it was nt anything special as death lived in a world between heaven and hell . so , limbo really and that was alright by death . a large space of nothingness , a nothing space . newline newline yet , death was comfortable in his surroundings and therefore , did nt require the need to have to go visit any other realm as all the gods in the heaven and all the devils from hell would simply meet with death in his world of limbo if some kind of conference needed to be held as it was truly the only neutral zone . everything could be found in his own little world so , why leave ? newline newline a sound goes off , death begins stirring . cursing and swearing about what could have caused such a disruption . doors open and there standing in front of him is one of his disciples of death . newline newline  ed , what the fuck ? why are you here ? you know you should be here if something is up and i swear nothing better be up .  newline newline  well sir , i ve been with you for a very long time , we both know that but , i ve encountered something you should really see .  newline newline hesitantly death agrees but , ed started walking away from the door . newline newline  ed , where the hell are you going ?  newline newline  look boss , just follow and trust me .  ed replied . newline newline they walked for a while through nothingness until , a faint blue glow began to grow and grow . death , recognized this as the entrance to earth however , he barely recognized it as he had not seen earth for a long time . the blue glow began getting larger and brighter , death could make out a door . ed stood in front of it and looked at death with a solemn look . newline newline  i want to show you something but , first i need to tell you that i m retiring . i ve been doing this for so long that i need to just be mortal again and live out my days enjoying what i need to show you . you ve been caged up for so long that i think its time that you see what you ve been missing out on .  newline newline the door began to vibrate and change colours . from a blue to a bright green filled with various other colours . ed , opened the door and there in front of the two of them was earth but , here they found themselves on a grassy hill that went down into a valley that stretched on what seemed like forever . on the horizon however , you could see what looked like the sea . newline newline the death from centuries ago would have been unimpressed but , it had been so long since he has seen earth . the sights in front of him were breathtaking , the rolling hills , the blue sky with a few white fluffy clouds and the light warm wind that had the scent of the salt sea faintly on it . newline newline  this is what you ve missed out on , all these years that you ve been away you ve missed out on this beautiful place . now follow me again , i have a small boat waiting for us .  newline newline to the horizon they walked and death , he marveled at the beauty and how everything seemed to work in unison . as they neared the sea they began walking on golden sand ever so warm to the touch of feet . there within a few dozen meters was the water with a small engine boat pegged to the ground . newline newline ed clambered in first and then death who felt like he was in some kind of surreal dream . the boat began to move further away from the shore and onto the great waves of the atlantic . the sea , so big so vast struck a chord in death . so long had he been away from earth that it almost felt like he had been wasting so much precious time . newline newline  this is nt even the most prettiest sight either , ohhhh no there s much more that you ve been missing . if you want hell , i would almost recommend retiring with me and we could sail to all those places and finally enjoy what this world has to offer .  ed said with a grin on his face . newline newline astounded by the immense beauty of everything he had just witnessed how could death not say yes ? he had been death since the start of time and had seen so much ugliness that it was definitely time for a change . he considered it , maybe a leave of absence then get back to it . in order to do this though , he had to reach inside himself and pull out the spirit that made him death and then he would become human and the spirit would go and pick someone else as death would live out the rest of his days . newline newline realizing there d be no return but , so taken aback by this beauty he looked at ed and simply nodded . a smile on his face , he was about to be released and then he could immerse himself in this beautiful world . reaching inside himself , the transformation was almost immediate . human features began to shape and death fell to his knees in agony as he had never felt physical pain like a human did . with all these new organs and nerves he could feel like he never had before . once he became human he looked up and there above him was ed holding the spirit of death . newline newline a grin on his face and a maniacal laughter . there would be no trip around the world there would only be what came next . death found himself rocketed off the boat and while in the air , the sky became grey and rain began falling from the heavens . it was something out of a matrix movie , everything had slowed down for death , now mortal falling to his very own death . there was still beauty in it all and as he plunged into the water , peacefulness . newline newline his lungs filling up with salt cold water he could only regret that he did not get to see the rest of the world . death did not close his eyes as he fell deeper and deeper into , nothingness . newline

boring . not a conducive atmosphere to good art . nope ,  she thought , no use bringing this one to life .  the sad little fairy she d sketched looked back at her from the paper . the lines meant to organize her notes looked like pale blue prison bars , trapping the pathetic creature . it was like it knew what it was missing out on . but that was silly , it was never alive at all . newline newline lissa flipped back , looking at other sketches born of boredom . they never had the same spark as the one s she freed . maybe it was nt even her doing it , it was the spark . but she knew it

room , lissa pulled the thin pad from her bag . she could nt work on these in class , they deserved much better . she was just finishing coloring this one ... done ,  she thought , looking down at the dragon gliding across the page . his scales were all shades of the ocean , greens and blues , and his wings transparent like a flies . he was beautiful . lissa hopped off the bed and stuck the open sketchpad to the wall with the magnets she had affixed to the back of it . closing her eyes , she leaned forwards and breathed . not the same as blowing , lissa let out a steamy hot breath from the bottom of her lungs , pushing until she felt lightheaded . one more time ,  she thought , still not opening her eyes . she released another breath and this time she knew it was done . the energy she channeled had burned the lights out again , but this one was so beautiful she had forgotten to turn them off . it happened often enough , lissa had never been very popular so she made her own friends  she never questioned how she was able to do this . newline newline lissa carefully made her way across the room , not wanting to hit anything in the darkness . pulling apart her black out curtains let in a stream of sunlight , unfiltered by clouds or trees it lit the room . there on her bed post was her exquisite creation . its scales glimmer in the light and as she smiled it spread its gossamer wings and began to fly towards her . lissa stretched out her hand but her eyes were pulled away from the shimmering dragon to the black streaks on her arm . lissa looked back and the dragon was gone , it was just her arm , black and red and full of holes . newline newline reality came swirling back around her outstretched arm . the windows were shut , her sketchpad was on the floor , her arm was bleeding , and she was in bed . lissa sobbed as she looked down at the empty syringe on her lap . it was gone again . her special gift was gone .twas the night before christmas , and round every star

then , in a twinkling like stars in the night , newline the a.i . decided to treat this thing right , newline it turned off its forcefields and opened the door . newline a man in a spacesuit fell onto

newline  happy christmas to all , and to all a goodnight ! before i start , i m going to say that i really liked this topic . newline newline newline the alarm went off , snapping me out of a dream that i can not quite remember now . all i know was it was awesome and being torn from it already put a bad start to my day . newline newline immediately , my nostrils were filled with what smelt like a pumpkin spiced latte . i looked to the right side of my bed to see if bethany had grabbed a pie or maybe a frappecino for me , to see that lying beside me was just a pumpkin lying on my girlfriend s old , worn pajamas . no , he would nt , would he ? i got up from my bed quickly to suddenly hear someone singing , that song from iron man , you know , by acdc ? anyway , i ran to the kitchen to see that my wizard houseguest was sitting at the kitchen table , playing a single guitar that looked as though it cost more than a car . newline newline  oh , tony , it s good to see you . why do nt you sit down , i ve got some food cooking .  i looked to my right to see a giant bald dog with bloodred skin and trumpets for eyes using a spatulapaw to cook some weird , glowing yellow chunks of burrito meat . it looked like the devil s diarrhea after a night of taco bell . newline newline  frank , why is my girlfriend a pumpkin ? !  i yelled at him . he ignored my question and started to play the song from game of thrones perfectly , as he added his own lyrics . newline newline  i m a , effing wizard , i am cool . i am cool , dude , i am cool , dude , i am cool , cool cool . cool dude , i am a really cool wizard .  i grabbed the guitar out of his hand , only for it to turn to purple and gold glitter in my hands . newline newline  goddamnit frank ! answer me or i m going to shove this ... glitter up your rear end .  i wondered , if i got it in there , would it turn back into a guitar ? newline newline  she called me ugly .  the all powerful wizard told to me as he sulked like a five year old girl who was told she can not have the bear she wanted . his great , golden brown beard changed color to match the color of cheddar cheese . newline newline  she called your robe ugly . what do you expect , it was purple and had weird creatures all over it like a bad pair of pajamas . you do nt turn someone into a pumpkin for that !  i pointed at the abomination in the other room .  and what the hell is that thing in my kitchen ? !  newline newline  he s a rescue . his owner used to test spells on him .  frank told me , nonchalantly . newline newline  you mean to tell me that used to be a regular dog ?  i asked , exasperated as the monstrosity turned toward me . suddenly , its eyehorns honked and i nearly jumped out of my skin . newline newline  i do nt know . i just thought it looked pretty cool .  newline newline  frank , i ca nt keep you here anymore . i can not do this anymore , i simply can not . first , you turn my tv into a weird tentacle monster , then you give my car legs . now you ve done this to beth and , that s just enough . you need to get out .  newline newline  but what if i turn her back ?  he asked , starting to cry weird , orange tears which dissolved my floorboards when they dripped onto them . newline newline  it s more than that . tell your uncle merlin i m sorry , but i m tired of you . no favor is worth this .  newline newline  you ll miss me , so if you want me back , call from this phone on your bed .  suddenly , frank turned into some sort of green vapor that crept out my window . i looked in my bedroom to see that beth was still a pumpkin , but there was now a phone right next to her . the weird dog thing was still in my kitchen . newline newline i started to wonder if any nearby pounds would take it . newline newline and now , i m wondering if bethany is worth bringing frank back into my life .june 16 : newline newline the sun was just beginning its assent . the morning sky was hewn with streaks of orange and pink from the fires still burning . i needed no alarm to wake me  the sirens from various emergency services did that for me . i ripped down the covers and threw my legs over the side of the bed , resting my head in my hands . newline newline why , i thought . every year was the same , even as a child : stay inside , lock your doors , keep your loved ones close and try to remain hidden . they say it s for the greater good , but i ve know some great people who ve died and nothing good came from it , just more dead and destruction . i got up and hit an array of buttons on the wall . the shield lifted from my house revealing the outside world . as the grated steel receded , i caught my first glimpse of the aftermath of this year s purge . my stomach dropped as the scene unfolded : newline newline the house nextdoor was but a smoldering , strewn pile of smokey ash  various pentagrams adorned the  unprotected  homes , smeared in  what a novice of the purge would consider  red paint  multiple , severed limbs of neighborhood youth scattered the lawn out front , and mother s wept on their doorsteps as husbands picked through the mangled body parts of their kin . newline newline i closed the blinds unable to gaze a second longer . i hung my head in disappointment and cursed those who participate in such a primal , disgusting event . newline newline t364 days and counting ... well , we did both promise you both our first born ...  the father recalled , with a hint of a smirk . newline newline  and i think your solution is as simple as your problem !  the mother beamed newline newline  if we split the child in half ...  said witch  1 newline newline  both of our spells will fail !  finished witch  2 newline newline  ah ...  the father chuckled ,  but if you two join in holy

adoption ! !  the mother continued ,  so we ll just keep an eye on him until you re ready !  the mother finished . newline newline  oh come on ! ! !  witch  1 screams . newline newline  hey , i m not that bad !  witch  2 cries newline newline  i m not taking about your muleface . i looked in the crystal ball , and this kid will have been dead for centuries before we can legally marry !  witch  1 retorts . newline newline  goddamnit ! !  witch  2 screams . newline newline smoke fills the room , and the witches menacingly proclaim ,  you have spared the life of your first born , at the expense of your later born . we shall claim the first child in your heir , whoever the hell that ends up being , once our right to marry those of our own gender  ct becomes law .  the two spoke in unison . newline newline  so . ..you ll become gay pride activists then ?  the father asks . newline newline  i guess we have to . ..  says the witch newline fuck ... ..  newline newline it was too late now . why does the government always have to do such dangerous , dumb shit . i mean , first it was the manhattan project , then area 51 . newline newline now they are going to release fucking skynet on us . newline newline i calmed down , trying to stop the system before it hit the open net . i tried every trick in the book , every loop and section shutdown . hell , i even tried just asking the ai nicely in the chat box . newline newline  please do nt leave .  newline newline  so long suckers .  newline newline it was too late now . it was way too late . i mean , if you are going to develop an sentient ai do nt put it on a damn usb stick in a computer lab with wifi . i looked at my watch . we had maybe , 10 seconds . god help us . newline newline i looked at the tv . it was showing the ball drop . how ironic that the new year would usher in an ai dominated age . newline newline 5 ... ... ... 4 ... ... .. 3 ... ... . 2 ... ... .. 1 ... ... .. newline newline what i saw after that may have been the most ridiculous , juvenile thing i had seen in my lifetime . newline newline dicks . everywhere . big floppy penises on every screen in the lab . i looked up at the tv , showing the big screen in times square . newline newline of course ... ... ... ... ... .. a penis .we walked out into the clearing and there it was . a big silver disk that had crashed into the ground , knowing over trees . newline newline  wow  said my brother jack newline newline  woah  i said , trying to carve out my own path newline newline  what is that  he said newline newline  it s an alien space ship  newline newline  there s no such thing as aliens you stupid idiot  said jack newline newline  i m telling mom you called me an idiot  newline newline  that s a damn lie  said jack newline newline jack had recently learned swear words and was now using them at every opportunity even when it did nt make sense . he seemed to think it made him special and gave him something to lord over me because he never figured out that by using the swear words i was also learning them , and at a younger age than he did . newline newline i was the smart brother . newline newline  i m telling mom you said damn  i said newline newline  then i m going to tell her that you said damn  said jack newline newline  but i only said it after you said it , you said it first  newline newline then he started to chase me . he knocked me to the ground and held my face into the dirt . newline newline  get the dna off me  i said . newline newline dna did nt really sound like a swear but it was the one he was most hesitant to use so i figured it was important . he had nt even meant for me to hear it , i heard it through his door while he was practicing swearing one time . just jack being stupid and teaching me which swear was the worst without even meaning too . newline newline i tried to throw him off but i could nt , but then i heard a hissing noise and he stopped holding me down . i looked up . a ramp had come down from the silver disk . something grey was walking down it . newline newline the thing was humanoid . i learned that word from a science fiction book . i never used it around jack though . he d probably just start using it wrong . that dog is humanoid , that tree is humanoid , spackzing like that . newline newline  humans  the grey humanoid said . newline newline jack screamed like a little girl and threw a rock at the thing . newline newline  ahh  said the grey humanoid as it fell over . newline newline  alien  screamed jack like a little girl  alien  newline newline  i told you there were aliens  i said . newline newline jack picked up a stick and started walking over to it , but i picked up a bigger stick and got there first . newline newline jack poked it with the stick like a dummy while i kept mine ready to hit the alien with in case it woke up . newline newline  i think i killed it  said jack newline newline  there s no way you killed it with one rock throw  i said newline newline the grey humanoid groaned and sat up . jack screamed like a little girl . newline newline  hello humans  it said newline newline i jumped back so that jack had more room to hit it with his stick and so that i could get more distance so i could have more leverage to do more damage because i was stronger than jack . newline newline  ahh  said the grey humanoid as it fell back . newline newline  woah , what s that  i said , reaching for something by it s side newline newline  it s mine , i saw it first  said jack and he grabbed it . newline newline it looked like a gun . newline newline  woah  said jack my word , the younger brothers word  it s a gun  newline newline  let me see  i said newline newline  i can hold an alien gun one handed  newline newline  it s probably just real advanced alien technology that s really light  i said newline newline  no , it s pretty heavy  said jack newline newline he turned around and squeezed the trigger , his arm flew up as a bolt of light flew out and hit a tree . the tree exploded . newline newline  let me try  i said newline newline  no , i found it , it s mine  newline newline  i found it  newline newline  but i knocked out the alien twice . it s mine . i won it in battle  newline newline  it was nt a battle  newline newline  i battled the alien for it  newline newline  humans , we come in pea  newline newline jack screamed like a girl and turned around and kept screaming like a girl and shot the grey humanoid in the chest . the gun went flying out of his hands . newline newline  ahh  said the grey humanoid as it got knocked down newline newline i took the opportunity to run and get the gun . jack tried to get it too but he s kind of fat so he s slower than me . newline newline i picked up the gun and looked at it . it was really light . i knew jack was lying . but i did nt have any trouble carrying it because i was stronger than jack even though i was younger . newline newline  what does this button do ?  i said . i pushed it and the gun became bigger  woah  newline newline  hey no fair , i did nt get to use the bigger gun  newline newline  too bad . you should have pushed the button when you had a chance  newline newline  i was gon na  newline newline i turned around and aimed at a tree and pulled the trigger . when it got bigger it got lighter and with my strength i was able to control it , not like jack . lots of bolts of light came out and blew up lots of trees . way more bolts and more trees then jack . newline newline  humans , please do not be alarmed , we come in  newline newline we both spun around . jack screamed like a little girl , i yelled like a man and held down the trigger like in that movie i watched at billy s house . it was rated r. i bet jack has never seen a movie with blood in the title . newline newline all my bolts hit the alien and the gun did nt go flying out of my hands like jack . newline newline  ahh  said the grey humanoid as he got knocked down . newline newline  that s a really tough alien  said jack newline newline i would have said resilient , because i know more words than jack . newline newline another grey humanoid appeared at the top of the ramp . newline newline  spackzing , you alright ?  newline newline  yeah  groaned the grey humanoid newline newline  did i hear shooting ?  newline newline  yeah  newline newline  did you tell them we come in peace ?  newline newline  yes  said the grey humanoid , sounding really angry newline newline  do nt yell at me spackzing . what did they say when you said we come in peace ?  newline newline  they did nt say anything , they threw a rock at me , then hit me with a stick then shot me  newline newline  i heard two rounds of shooting  newline newline  then they shot me again  newline newline  are you sure that you told them we come in peace  newline newline  of course i told them we come in peace  newline newline  you actually only told us you come in pea  said jack newline newline stupid jack , annoying the alien and he does nt even have a gun . jack is so annoying . newline newline  maybe they do nt understand english  said the grey humanoid at the top of the ramp . try french , did you listen to the french tapes ?  newline newline spackzing turned around to look at us  can i have my gun back ?  newline newline  no it s ours  said jack , before poking him with a stick . he poked him several times . newline newline spackzing turned around  you know what , just call in the mother ship , we re taking over this bitch  then he turned back to us  see how you little shit s like getting hit with sticks and shot  newline newline  did you know your name is a swear for poop ?  i said newline newline jack laughed for some reason . probably because he was stupid .august 15 ? , 2017 : newline newline i do nt know what date it is and it s not like it matters anymore , my suunto stopped working somewhere in the grand staircase . newline

the oppression of the 9 to 5 workday and the 40 hour workweek was bearable . newline newline in recent years , however , scientists have begun experimenting with the drug . while these experiments have mainly been limited to nonhuman subjects , a few prominent companies are poised to start trials administering small drips to humans . it is postulated that crack caffeine s effect on depressed subjects may give it some medicinal merit . newline newline in this respect , policy seems on pace to outstrip science . oregon and washington state , historic crack caffeine hubs , and washington , d.c. , a city where many prominent citizens , including congresspeople , have been accused of being coffeeheads , are considering legislation to decriminalize crack caffeine . these regions have already instituted policies allowing for medical use of condensed crack caffeine , known to users as  chocolate  . newline newline there is no word yet on whether the federal government will continue to enforce crack caffeine prohibitions in states in which it is decriminalized  the federal government is waiting to see if this legislation becomes law . newline newline back to you , diana . newline newline anchor :  weighty stuff , em . thank you . as the time is now 4:19 p.m. , we ll be taking the customary break . see you in a few minutes , folks . and in the meantime , as always , blaze it . newline newline no , you ca nt do it , xanar . this is a huge violation of the preserving treaty , you know that ?  newline newline  i know . but she s dying , cronar . i ca nt just sit here watching that .  newline newline  they have their healers too , xanar . they will take care of her .  newline newline  they do . but they never found the proper way to cure her . cancer , i believe that s what they call . here it s written in every textbook . i mean , cronar , it s not like i am sending them a cookbook for a thermal wormhole generator . i am just sending them some instruction to fix this girl . and maybe other kids .  newline newline  as far as we know , it can stun their civilization s progress for years . even decades . the last time we did it , athris went into a full blown civil war , which nearly annihilated the planet , and its people now resort to nomadic tribes . if i remember it right , some of our scientists accidentally suggest them how to double their life span . then somehow it evolved into mess within a year . our computer model predicted that if they found the lifeexpanding protein just twenty years after that , it would have become an utopia . our guy did nt want any harm , xanar . i believe you do nt , either . it s really hard , i understand , but we have to look at the big picture . i m sorry , but i can not authorize you to use the beam transmitter .  newline newline  no , but i ca nt just do nothing . i have the mean to change that . i have a way to save this kid from dying , and you expect me to just sit there and watch ? i do nt know about that , but i ca nt do that , cronar .  newline newline  you think it is pleasant for me , huh ? i ve been in this position for a very long time , xanar , and i am well aware of this kind of situation . you should get some counselling , because i do nt think you are emotionally fit for this job anymore . come back when you feel better . meanwhile we will assign someone else to communicate with earth .  newline newline  cronar , you ca nt do that . you ca nt just let someone die , you know . it s morally wrong . and if you do nt let me access the transmitter now , i will send you my resignation letter in an hour .  newline newline  then i will accept it . but i wo nt give the access to you .  newline newline   newline newline xanar took a deep breath , and put on his helmet . he knew this was the last time , and he could nt even bring himself to talk with liz again . but it had to be done . he turned on his control panel , and as the button lit up , he drifted to another planet , 300 million lightyear away . newline newline communication established . newline starting new neural links . newline connected newline newline he was now standing in front of a kid , tethered by all the tube and lines and machines to her bed . he stood there for a while , and gently called her . newline newline  hey kid !  newline newline  hey mr. teapot . how are you !  the girl opened her eyes , and smiled at him . newline newline  i m super good . it s a sunny day outside , liz , do you want to go outside ?  newline newline  i want to , mr. teapot . but i am very sick today . i ca nt even lift my feet . will i ever go outside again , mr . teapot .  newline newline  you will , liz . and you know what , i can take you out now .  newline newline  really ?  newline newline  wait for me for a second , all right ?  newline newline xanar winked , and took of his helmet . he pulled out a second control board . twenty years of doing this job , and this was the first time he used it . and he hoped no one would ever have to use it in their lifetime . newline newline beginning new neural projection . newline scanning brain activity . newline creating astral projection . newline completed newline newline xanar and liz walked together to the park . they all knew that something would come , but for this very brief moment , liz was running and picking leaves in the breeze of a sunny autumn day . then she began to fade away . and so did xanar . newlineit was a depressing combination , but as we walked back from the hospital , we made sure for the last time that we had each other s last wishes right . if it was me , i just wanted to be buried here , in the little local plot . close by to my wife and little girl . if it was her , she wanted to be cremated , and mailed , she was specific about the mail , she loved letters , and though being one would be a fitting last incarnation , to her home country , and scattered there .  my little english rose  i whisper to my baby ,  and my sweet french princess  , i whisper to my wife . regardless of what else happened , we would stay here , in the english countryside . my wife had wanted to move back to the french countryside , but we realised that moving away from everything we had here was too final . we wanted to keep something alive between us , even if only one of us was actually alive . we finally got home , and little lily genevieve brave had fallen asleep in lorelei s arms . lily and lorelei brave , i reflect , are wonderful names for a single mom and her kids . she got my middle name , gabriel , stylized , but nearly . i love her  , i think , but raising her on my own , never  . at that moment , i knew it was me . as i slip away , i hear lily and lorelei crying . but then , wait , i m still here . they ca nt see me , but i m here . i pass through lorelei , and she smiles . then lily does . they ca nt see me , but i ll never leave them . never .it was truly the holiday season . for the first time since they got married jenna s and matthew s entire family had gotten together to celebrate . and they had much to celebrate , since jenna was due to deliver in two days . newline as appetizers began to wane and the volume in the house began to steadily increase matthew stood up with his nearly empty glass of wine . newline  attention , attention ! jenna and i want to take a moment to thank you all for coming this year . we thought it would be much easier to have a baby than to explain to my parents why we went to the greens this year .  newline there was moderate but hearty laughter . newline  we are truly blessed to be bringing our daughter into such loving families .  matthew turned to look at his wife , redness is both of their cheeks .  and i am blessed to have such a beautiful woman as the mother of my  newline matthew paused as jenna s face turned from awe to upset . she looked confused for a moment until her eyes widened . she opened her mouth to scream but immediately silenced it . trembling and silently she said , almost to matthew alone ,  we need to go to the hospital . it s happening  newline they had practiced for this moment for weeks . matthew knew exactly how to react , exactly how to maneuver out of conversations . but what he had nt prepared for was the amount of joy he would feel with those words . that and the wine . much to jenna s horror , matthew exclaimed ,  we re having the baby !  newline screams erupted from around the room . immediately the two mothers ran to jenna . newline  take deep breaths !  exclaimed one . newline  you have to relax . do nt drop my granddaughter on the tile floor !  joked the other . newline matthew s dad came over .  alright , alright . let s load into the mercedes and we ll head to the hospital now .  newline  no , no .  said jenna s dad , now up from his corner chair and making his way .  please , you drove all the way over here . let me take them to the hospital . it s the least i could do .  newline then the expecting grandmothers chimed in . first , matthew s .  rob , you can barely stand without a cane . there s no need for you to drive them . we re perfectly able to  newline  what are you , nuts ?  robert said , almost yelling .  i drove all the way over from the hotel . you think i ca nt make it 10 minutes to the hospital ?  newline matthew s dad , geoffery , replied ,  we re not saying you ca nt do it . there s just no reason for it . i really do nt mind doing it .  newline  but we want to !  jenna s mom almost shrieked in .  please , wo nt you let us do this ? we ca nt afford all the things they need for the baby . please let us do this one thing !  newline  we do nt mind !  yelled matthew s mom .  it s really no problem . we ll drop them off then come back and pick you up !  newline  pick us up ?  robert replied , startled .  i told you , we can drive perfectly fine ! we ll meet you there . besides , we do nt want to get your car messy .  newline  but i insist you let us take them . so what if it gets messy ? we ll bring a towel and we ll get it cleaned before we go home . just give it a rest already !  newline before jenna s parents could respond the phone rang . the room went silent as everyone looked around . after what felt like hours the answering machine picked up .  hi , this is matt and jen . we re not home right now but please leave a message or try our cell phones . have a great day !  after the beep matthew s voice continued ,  hey guys , jenna just had the baby . she s a beautiful , healthy girl at 7.3 pounds . we ca nt wait to introduce you ! hope to see you soon . beep !  newline jenna s dad answered first .  i ll drive .  newline beth ?  i asked , and squeezed her hand ,  you think i ll have a personality of you once i m raptured ?  newline newline she looked at me and laughed .  of course , silly . you would nt have much fun without me there , would you ?  newline newline  no , never ,  i grinned back at her .  i m just worried that they ll get you wrong , somehow . that it wo nt be the same . after all , you ll just be an extrapolation of my memories , you know ?  newline newline  awww , are nt you sweet  she replied , and gave me a peck on the cheek .  you have nothing to be worried about , i promise . heaven 10.2 is the best thing humans have ever done .  newline newline at least until heaven 11.0 is released , i thought to myself with an inner roll of the eyes . she was right of course , all sarcasm aside . the millions of people involved in the operation of heaven and the trillions of manhours devoted to this project were enough to stagger the mind . nearly the entirety of senior year was spent in classes detailing the complex web of interconnected services that made heaven possible . and classes , of course , about heaven itself . all of which led to the inescapable conclusion that the heaven program was the pinnacle of all mankind s achievements . newline newline  look , beth , i know as well as you do how happy everyone is in heaven . i ve seen the readouts of dopamine levels , the peaceful looks on their faces in cryo , i know how before they started rapturing , people would spend the rest of their natural life begging to go back under .  newline newline i sighed , unsure how to convey my uneasy feeling .  i know all of that , i m just really happy now , with this . with us  our lives together .  newline newline beth took one of my hands in both of hers .  as am i  she said , her eyes shining .  these last two years have been wonderful , and i could nt imagine a better person to be with me forever in heaven .  newline newline  then why do nt we both stay , become lifers ?  i blurted , leaning forward .  i m sure they d give me a job in augmentation , working on the next version rollout . you could work in the children s precinct , you re great with kids ! maybe one day we could even have kids of our own .  newline newline  jason , what s gotten into you ?  she stared at me , surprise and concern showing clearly on her face .  in two years you ve never said anything like this , i thought you were looking forward to being raptured as much as i was .  newline newline  i was ! at least , i thought i was .  i let go of her hands and stood up .  i always took it for granted i would choose heaven . all of our friends planned on being raptured , and there was never a reason for me to consider staying .  newline newline i paced the corridor in front of our chairs . what had gotten into me ? what is a century of humdrum life on a tiny planet compared to heaven ? i could have any number of children there , with any number of women . i could travel the galaxy for a millennia , sample exotic food and drink from the universes  finest chefs , make love on rosette sandy beaches under the light of a red giant star . never grow old , never know death or loss . newline newline i could imagine so many things , yet they say it s even better than the best thing you could possibly imagine . newline newline and everyone is happy in heaven . for there is no sorrow , no sadness there . newline newline the uneasiness welled up in me as i sat back down next to beth . she brushed the bangs out of her eyes then set her hand on my shoulder . newline newline  its okay to be nervous , jason . we re about to do a big thing , the biggest thing of our lives !  newline newline  i love you , beth .  newline newline she smiled again , her soft smile this time .  i love you too , jason .  newline newline  please stay with me , here ? i ca nt shake the feeling that i ll lose what we have in heaven . will our happiness mean anything if there is no sadness ? if all there is in heaven is love , it s not better than any other feeling , it just is . if love does nt have to overcome any obstacles , is it even still love ?  newline newline  sweetheart , sweetheart , slow down !  she started , then paused for a few seconds .  jason , you re overthinking this . it s going to be fine . it s going to be more than fine , it ll be absolutely fantastic ! there s no way to tell exactly what it ll be like on the other side , but why would the preraptures sell all their possessions to go back under if it was nt much better than being a lifer ?  newline newline i sighed .  i do nt know . i do nt suspect anyone does now . all i can tell you is what i feel , and i feel like you and i do nt need heaven handed to us , we can build our own here , together .  i gave her a quick kiss .  and it will mean more than theirs ever could .  newline newline  argh !  she exclaimed playfully ,  you re so sweet you re hurting my teeth !  she leaned over and put her arms around my neck .  if we did stay i guess it would nt be so bad . i just do nt understand why you do nt want something that wo nt be ...  newline newline the door at the end of the hallway opened . a tall , older man with a bushy grey beard walked briskly towards us . we both stood up hastily as he approached . newline newline  bethany alders ,  he said , peering down at her with a smile ,  please come with me .  newline newline  can i please have just one more minute to say goodbye ?  newline newline his smile faltered .  i regret that you can not . that is the purpose for which your elapsed time in this room was allocated .  he held out his arm expectantly . newline newline beth hugged me fiercely and whispered in my ear .  do nt be scared . i ll always be with you .  then she turned and took hold of his arm . just before the door closed behind them she turned back to smile at me . newline newline then i was alone . to wait and to think . newline newline did she mean she would stay and be a lifer with me ? or was she merely saying goodbye ? did she think i was just having last minute jitters or did she think i was serious about building a life together ? newline newline the more i thought about it , the less sure i became of what to do . newline newline if beth thought i was just feeling nervous , she would do what we had always planned on doing and become enraptured . if she thought i was serious and planned to stay behind , she might make either choice . newline newline eventually i realized that if i chose to be raptured , but beth had not , she would end up alone . beth , who wanted nothing but to spend an eternity with me in heaven , robbed of everything because of my stupidity and selfishness . newline newline i knew i could not let that happen . i knew what my choice must be . newline newline strangely , as i came to this realization , i also came to realize that beth had not stayed behind . a part of me saw that it was still a possibility , logically , but i knew that she would not take that option . i knew she would be enraptured . newline newline had been enraptured . for thirtysix years . newline newline the door at the end of the hallway opened once more , and out stepped the same man . newline newline  jason whitman , please come with me  came the request , as expected . newline newline we walked into his office , a second time . newline newline this time there was only one door . newline newline he sat down behind the desk , and gestured for me to take a seat as well . i did so as he pushed a piece of paper across the desktop to my side . newline newline  congratulations are in order , mr . whitman !  newline newline i nodded numbly . newline newline  i know it s a lot to process at first , but you re a pretty sharp one . only took you two times around , most spend several cycles in primary school .  newline newline  like beth ?  i asked . newline newline  i would nt worry too much about her .  he chuckled wryly .  given your influence on her , i will be very surprised if she does nt graduate next cycle .  newline newline  i ll still miss her for the next eighteen years .  newline newline  of course you will my boy , but eighteen years is just a drop in the bucket for you now . the real body of humanity is much different than you saw while you were in school . now that you are joining us , you ll learn all of that in due time as you begin your higher education .  newline newline  will the rest of my studies be so ... immersive ?  i asked . newline newline  no , not unless you request it . the only course that we have looped until completion is the one you just passed . it is the single prerequisite to join the race of men . and before i forget , please , take your diploma .  he pointed to the paper on his desk . newline newline i picked it up . it simply read : newline newline agap . newline newline newline it s not that the grass is greener , it s that there even shades of green at all . there s only so much bliss any consciousness can take , only so much perfection it can experience .  newline newline the noise from shuffling feet along the edges of the granite auditorium were always difficult to overcome at first , and just at the thought his voice was more than adequate . newline newline  the question is nt if you ll want to leave , the question is when . you ll revel ...  newline newline it was odd that they raised their hands now , only a short time before they would just blurt out any questions and continue to until they were answered . more interesting was the way the first question had changed . newline newline  yes , you there in the third tier , your hand was up .  newline newline  is ... is this ... am i in hell ?  newline newline his quivering voice and the terror of miscomprehension was spreading among them all as they turned to one another . they always thought they were in or going to hell . newline newline  no , at least not yet .  newline newline they rarely grasped the concept quickly , no matter how clearly and eloquently stated . it was better to let them have their moment of panic and then reassure them after , they listened much better . newline newline they were shouting now , some at him , others to one another , if he let them go long enough they d start pounding on the stone doors they meandered in from . newline newline newline  okay , okay , okay ! whatever you thought when you sat down is either wrong or not a complete perspective .  newline newline  none of you are dead !  newline newline that was straight out of the textbook and never failed to quell panic , you also got those puzzled faces . it was annoying that every group responded and appeared the same way . newline newline  if you ll give me a brief time without interruption i ll make everything clear as quickly as possible .  newline newline silence , it was starting to get to him that everything came so easily . newline newline  as i said none of you are actually dead . however , you ve died . initially you ll understand this as the afterlife , though as you re currently living  feel free hold your breath to test this , you re not able to experience physical pain or discomfort . emotionally you ll find something similar , as soon as you recognize a situation in which you expect distress perspective will come and smooth things out .  newline newline  death is not a state of being , it is merely the transition to what you re likely to currently think of as heaven .  newline newline  birth and death are simply the processes of moving between lives .  newline newline  this is heaven and you will enjoy it , for a time . some of you will do so much longer than others , it s all relative to the current state of mind that you managed to accumulate during your  life  . eventually you ll realize this is as much your life as anything else .  newline newline  so as i said at the start , it s not that the grass is greener anywhere else , it s that are even shades of green to experience . trust me , as an angel , as your messenger , i assure you that each and everyone of you will long to encounter something that does not come easily . it s only a matter of time .  newline newline again with the raised hands , almost half of all the hands in this place . he wished they d do something rash instead , if only to break the monotony . newline newline  everyone here has questions as you can see .  newline newline their polite laughter was aggravating , that was a statement of fact not a cute observation made to make them more comfortable . newline newline  allow me to finish and i may answer most , if i do nt you ll find many others through the doors behind me that will .  newline newline  again you have died , but are currently living . eventually however you will desire to form a new consciousness and wish to leave . it is guaranteed that heaven will become hell , this is a cycle that has taken place across a span of time so long that at the moment you can only comprehend it as eternity .  newline newline  yes . you will meet your maker . you may even enjoy the company .  newline  yes , some of or all of your loved ones are here .  newline  no , no one is going to punish you for anything you ve done or thought .  newline  yes , you are in another dimension .  newline  no you re physical body is not here , nor will you ever possess it again .  newline  yes your appearance is what it was , or rather what you thought it was .  newline  yes , what some of you understand as reincarnation is true , albeit there s more to do with physics and thermodynamics than any morality or ethics .  newline newline the way they all sat , with such poise and calm it was evident the ether was beginning to take effect . if only they would not cave so quickly . newline newline  finally , yes you will better understand your own actions , shortcomings , and thoughts from before you died . as well as those of others that you remember .  newline newline that was the question that pacified any group , now they really were beginning to look like sheep . that notion had bothered him from his start as an angel , but watching it over and over it had become an livid observation . for some reason it was particularly infuriating now . newline newline  before you walk out these doors there is one last thing you must know .  newline newline  suicide  newline newline  it s the only way to leave this life . it is the only way to start a new consciousness . here no one can take your life , only you can .  newline newline at his first lectures their placidity at this news was a relief , now it was maddening . the serenity was nt coming as quickly as it once did , the fear of leaving this comfortable existence was nt ebbing either . newline newline  truly it s not a taking as much as it is a giving up , you ll have no craving for violence or a grandiose dramatic demise . there will be no hamartia , no need to hide or seek privacy .  newline newline  no one here is able to tell you what will occur to you . all we know is you will fade from here .  newline newline and honestly good ri ... ..we have been in cryo for the last 5 months . my first few breaths are difficult . it s been almost 300 days since we left earth to discover what curiosity saw before going dark . newline  3 hours until arrival  sounds across the vessel . newline the nausea kicks in and i fill my breathing apparatus with bile and whatever else was left in my stomach . i rip it off my face and watch it get vacuumed down the hose on my mask . looking over , chris and alex seem to be in similar shape . i argued against cryo before leaving . it does nt keep you sharp , kills the senses we ve been tuning up for years . they said it would be impossible to fit enough food and supplies for us to survive the trip there and back . could nt win that argument . newline newline we quickly get our suits on and prepare the module for the martian landing . alex looks bad , real bad . newline  you good to go ?  i ask . he nods . newline he would nt back out if his eyeballs were bleeding out his skull . you do nt dedicate the better part of your life to something like this and turn around at the front door . newline newline  3 minutes  chris tells us . newline i think about how far we ve come , both literally and physically . the three of us have traveled further than any human in existence . my stomach is in knots as i hear the countdown tick . newline  time to go gentlemen  chris gives us each a look then we detach from the shuttle . smooth and easy . we position the module for entry . newline newline i ve reentered the earths atmosphere two times . the martian atmosphere is much different , slower , and more forgiving . after the heat shields release , we get a look at the surface of the red planet . newline  45 seconds to touchdown  chris shouts . newline  deploying landing equipment . thrusters engaged  i tell them . newline newline we set down like a feather floating to the ground . newline  alex , deploy the rover .  chris orders . newline  deployed  he answers . newline we make our way down the ladder . chris closes the hatch and pressurizes the cabin before opening the external hatch . suddenly , chris freezes and looks at me . newline  we never decided who would be the first man on mars  newline  i m ok being second or third  i tell them both . newline alex shakes his head allowing chris to be the first man to step foot on the red planet . chris opens the hatch and starts heading down to the rover . i follow . newline  i should have pissed first  were chris  first words on mars . we all share a laugh and hop into the rover . newline newline the gravity is lower here , have to be careful not to drive this thing off the wrong side of a crater . curiosity was last heard from a few miles from our landing site . i wondered what it saw that made this mission priority number one . it s not our job to ask those types of questions . newline  slow it down , we re close  chris states . newline i ease up to the edge of the massive canyon . we jump out of the rover and get our gear ready to rappel down . alex knows he is hanging back with the rover . chris and i do one final check on the equipment before heading down . newline  ready ?  he asks . newline  guess so  i respond . newline newline the face of this canyon runs longer than i can see . it gets darker the further we descend . i just hope we have a long enough line to get us somewhere flat . newline  i m seeing a plateau coming up in about 300 feet . slow down and prepare for touchdown . copy ?  newline  yeah , dropping sticks .  newline i crack a few glow sticks and watch them fall slowly to a stop . we land on a the plateau easy enough . chris pulls a sun spot from his belt , tosses it in the air and lights the area around us . it hovers above us as we move into the valley of the canyon . newline  you getting a reading yet ?  newline i look to my screen , it shows nothing . newline  nothing yet  i look up and almost knock over chris . he s stopped and looking up . his eyes lit up like a christmas tree . i trace his gaze . my heart nearly stopped . before us was an incredible structure . it had columns the size of a football field and the architecture was impossible . it could only stand in this gravity . newline  so there s your answer  chris states .  we are not alone ...  newline it takes me a minute to digest this all . alex chirps in over the comms . newline  what is it ? can you guys he..  he cuts in and out . chris moves toward the structure . a figure forms in between the large columns . newline  chris , there s something there . wait a minute  i yell . newline the figure matches chris  movement , like a mirror image moving closer to itself . they come face to face . it takes the form of chris , in his suit and all . they do nt speak , only staring . newline  alex , come in . chris has made contact with some ... thing .  no response . newline i look away and then back again . chris is walking back towards me . changed . the figure has vanished . newline  we re leaving  chris tells me . newline  what are you talking about ? what was that chris ?  newline he does nt answer and makes his way back to the canyon face . newline  stop chris , what about the mission ?  newline i ca nt get through to him , no use . hopefully alex can . newline newline we reach the top of the canyon face and chris gets in the rover , still saying nothing . our leader and captain of the mission has final say . so we follow . newline when we reach the module , chris goes up first . first man on , first man off of mars . i ca nt believe what is happening . i did not waste the last 9 years of my life preparing for a day trip to mars . our mission was to recover curiosity and assess the reasons it malfunctioned . we have not done either . newline the module ride back to the shuttle is quiet . newline chris breaks his silence with  i ll explain everything back on the shuttle .  newline newline when we connect back up to the shuttle , the three of us get out of our suits and collect near the bunks . newline  chris , what just happened ?  i ask . newline  you saw what i saw , only you did nt hear what i did .  newline confused , angry i want him to just spill it and stop dragging it out . newline  this is going to be hard to understand , but that thing i saw was ...  newline he pauses a moment . newline  ... it was one of our ancestors .  newline alex and i look at each other like chris has lost it completely . newline  we are them and they are us . much more evolved than us or differently evolved . millions of years ago , mars was much like earth is today . the martians used up most of their resources like we are doing now . the planet eventually could not sustain life .  newline i knew he was telling the truth . newline  they were only able to send life to earth in a very simple form . we evolved from those organisms , adapting over millions of years and becoming what we are today .  newline the news was not easy to digest . newline alex asks ,  how are we going to be able to explain this chris ?  newline chris extends his hand to alex . he insists on touching it . hesitant at first , he reaches out and almost immediately alex s eyes go wide . his heart races and he can hardly catch his breath . alex knows everything . newline i wait a moment . chris insists on me touching his hand too , but do i really want to see what he has and have my entire sense of reality morphed ? i touch his hand . you realize what this means , do nt you ?  a shadowy figure spoke from its perch ten feet above commander uzyk .  humanity at large is losing hope . the outer walls of the sanctum fell last month , and even the citadel can not hope to survive long . and with this news   newline newline  i acknowledge that the situation is dire ,  she replied ,  but   newline newline  no . there is no other alternative . when the existence of life itself is threatened , those with the means to act must do so .  newline newline  who said that ? hitler ?  newline newline  who ?  newline newline  sorry . i used to read the ancient histories .  she shuddered as an explosion far away rocked the ground underneath her . crates of food and weapons crashed to the ground , and the failing fluorescent lights flickered a few times more .  listen , the council will never stand for your solution . and neither will i . we will fight to the death , but we wo nt sacrifice our principles .  newline newline the shapeless form laughed harshly .  you think your moral stand will be remembered for all of time . but who will do the remembering ?  it leaped from outcropping in the wall and stood next to her , still no more solid .  i will do this with or without your approval . do not get in my way .  newline newline it strode to a small door in the wall , and began pressing buttons on an keypad . as it did so , uzyk scrabbled around on the floor , at last grasping a discarded bottle of some substance . she turned it over and read the date : 1002151441 .  it reads today ,  she spat .  this is the last one . our final hope . it s dead and gone . as are we all .  newline newline the darkness turned towards her for a moment , and it seemed to almost pity her , before pressing a final button . the door swung open , revealing  newline newline a storeroom packed with thousands of containers labeled  corn syrup .  newline newline uzyk gasped and fell to her knees . shaking , she drew a gun from her belt and aimed it unsteadily at the blackness .  you have doomed us all ,  she murmured . newline newline  it is time to embrace the new way , commander . no longer can maple syrup sustain us . today we move forward together , into the light . i am humanity s savior . you are nothing .  newline newline uzyk fired , the shot missing and hitting a corn syrup bottle . it burst open in a glorious explosion . howling , she placed the handgun against her forehead and , with wavering hands , pulled the trigger . newline newline  so .  it said with a graceful finality .  it is over .  you are not like them  , gary said .  you are different .  newline newline  i am ?  i asked , confused . around gary , i was always confused . newline newline  yes , belle , you are .  newline newline i shook my head .  i m just a regular girl , confused and a bit dissatisfied with the world i live in , like every girl my age . i got this slight feeling that i m special , sure , but so does every other teenager . really , i m normal as they come .  newline newline  exactly .  newline newline  i mean , i d wear morrissey shirts , if the smiths existed in our fictional world .  newline newline gary nodded again .  yes . you are normal and bland . boring , even . a perfect blank slate . something every single reader can identify with and think i am special , for i am just like the special protagonist .  newline newline  but if everyone thinks they are special , does nt that defeat the very purp   newline newline  just go with it , belle . do nt question these things .  newline newline i sighed , tired .  fine . what do i have to do ?  newline newline  something absolutely awful and horrendous that no humane society would ever in a million years make people do just for the sake of adventure . it s going to be a death match with other teenagers .  newline newline  fuck . really ?  newline newline  do nt say fuck . ca nt say fuck in a ya .  newline newline  sorry . crap . really ?  newline newline  hey , it was either this or going through the triwizard tournament just for the sake of you touching a trophy that s going to transport you to a cemetery , when the person who turned the trophy into a portkey could just as well have newline turned any other object around you to a portkey during the whole school year at hogwarts and saved about 500 pages of what s arguably the weakest installment of the potter series .  newline newline  you know , there s not one part of this sentence i do nt need explained .  newline newline  just forget it . go get ready for the death match .  newline newline i nodded . it s silly , i know , but all of a sudden , i was worried .  gary wait  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  what if i die ?  newline newline and gary rolled his eyes at me .  you re not going to die , belle . you re the main character .  newline newline  are you sure ?  newline newline  oh , it s going to look like you are gon na die , a bunch of times . you might even actually die , but then you ll do newline some voodoo crap and just go back to life with no good explanation at all . man , i m angry at rowling today .  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  relax . you re not going to die . if anything , you ll probably even live longer in the movies , since they re likely to do two films out of the last book no matter how unnecessary that sounds .  newline newline gary , he had a way of calming me with his soft , confident tone and his reassuring smile . even when he talked nonsense , like he was now . again , i nodded .  thanks , gary .  newline newline  now go get ready to do stuff that has been done better a thousand times before so we can take money off of newline gullible people .  newline newline we hugged , and i turned back to leave . suddenly , though , a thought crossed my mind . newline newline  hey , gary  i said , turning back to him . newline newline  yeah ?  newline newline  you know how i date mike , and he s all strong and tanned and nice to me ?  newline newline  yeah  newline newline  and how you are thin and pale , but cute in a rebel kind of way , and you treat me like shit in a charming manner ?  newline newline  sure  newline newline i took another step towards him , feeling my cheeks blush .  well ... what if we start having feelings for each other ? and weird pg13 sexual tension moments between us ? and then maybe mike finds out , and stuff even gets a bit homoerotic between the two of you ? what if all that happens ?  newline newline gary took a deep breath . he rubbed his eyes with his hand , then pulled long , blonde locks of hair away from his newline face . his emerald blue eyes pierced me like a bad metaphor . newline newline  damn . robert pattinson is playing me in the movie , is nt he ?  he asked , in a tired voice . newline newline  probably  , i answered . newline newline and then we made out and subtextually fucked like rabbits . newline newline  newline newline edit : check

closed . my wife wanted it closed , she  d said it was a constant reminder that she was gone if she could look into emily  s room and see that she wasn  t there . if the door were closed , at least she could imagine emily was behind the door still . i wanted it open , though i had no real reason behind this , other than it just made more sense to have it open . newline newline throughout the week as either of us passed by emily  s room and the door wasn  t to our liking we  d either open it in my case or shut it in my wife  s case . either way the room was being aired our properly with our constant opening and closing of the door . her room had remained the same as she left it , bed made , shoes tucked in a corner , papers stacked neatly on her desk . on the rare occasion my wife did go into emily  s bedroom it was to dust and take down spider webs in the corners of the ceiling . i never went in , just the thought of going into emily  s bedroom without her in there made me weak in my knees . newline newline emily was our only child , having lost two in prior miscarriages before emily  s birth . she was truly our miracle baby , and we  d done everything we could to shield her from the dangers of life , to provide her with the best money could buy , and to be the most loving and understanding parents possible . that still wasn  t enough . it has been 4  years since emily ran away , leaving only a note on the kitchen cabinet and a cryptic facebook post . she  d run off with a fellow classmate , adam rodgers . they  d gone to chase the california coast , hoping to sail away into the sun . newline newline it had devastated me and her mother . there were days my wife couldn  t get out of bed , forcing me to be both the strong hold and provider . she eventually pulled herself up over the years and learned how to smile again , laughing was another matter . she felt that she couldn  t allow herself to be too happy , not with a daughter off god knows where . newline newline our faith struggled during these past four years . both of us gradually declined in our attendance to the local episcopalian church , while we were thankful for the prayers , deep down inside we were angry , at god and ourselves . newline newline it was a routine tuesday night , my wife had put on a roast in the crock pot and i  d made sure to bring home a gallon of bluebell  s finest . we sat the table together and talked about the mundane , my day at work and her efforts at home to  keep up with the housework  . as we sat across from one another , preparing to bow our heads for a moment of prayer , we were startled by glass breaking from down the hallway . newline newline instinctively i hushed my wife and stood to grab a knife from the kitchen counter . i motioned for my wife to call 911 and to move into the garage . as i inched down the hallway near emily  s room it occurred to me that i was actually quite frightened , and while i was able to be the protector and strong hold for my wife in the case of our missing daughter , i felt weak knowing that i was going to face an intruder . i was older now , my knees were bad , and this knife wasn  t much reassurance . newline newline as i slowly approached the room , slowly turning the corner of the door , there she stood , hair ragged , shoes torn and clothes too small . emily . newline newline  emily ?  i whispered . newline newline spinning around with a grin on her face  daddy ,  she ran to me and jumped into my arms . newline newline i dropped the knife and hugged her . she smelled of soot and rotten vegetables . she was exceptionally skinny , her breath of alcohol and her skin harsh and rough . newline newline  daddy , where have you been ? ! i  ve been all over the world , the world daddy and i  m back again , i  m back home and i  m ready for the world again , the cruel mean ole world ,  she giggled and hopped around , pulling clothes out of her closet and chest of drawers . newline newline  this would be so beautiful on me daddy , don  t think ? i could be a princess , a princess of the world daddy ,  as she placed different items up to her skin , around her head on her face . newline newline i turned to see my wife standing at the entrance of the bedroom , her mouth agape , and her body trembling . tears flooded down her cheeks , she struggled to speak . newline newline  mommy ! mommy where have you been , i  ve been over the world , all over the world.  emily started up again . newline newline i stood watching , as emily ran to her mother and my wife placed up her hands stopping her before emily could hug her . she stepped backwards and walked down the hall . i could hear from the conversation that she was calling the police . i pulled emily back and hugged her , and just held her , as i listened to my wife . newline newline  yes , 1917 woodrow lane , my daughter needs assistance , her mental state is diminished and we need an ambulance , now.  newline newline i held emily and cried . newlineugh amusement parks ... i hate amusement parks , all of my friends are on roller coasters having fun while i sit here like an idiot too afraid to go on

wondering what to play , just pick something . ddr ? no i already look like an idiot . alien hunter 7 ? no way am i wasting 4 bucks on one game . pinball ? pfft what is this ? the 70  s ? why would i play any of these pinball machines ? but , that one right there , the middleearth looking one , it feels as though it  s calling out to me ... wow , this one looks really old ... . the figures look

where i am ?  newline newline  all of your questions will be answered , come with me , i have much to explain , and we have a lot of work to do ... chosen one .  quiet , qunitus .  brutus stood at the helm of the class , his armoured hand gripping the marbled podium . his naked hand was resting on the steam engine s lever .  we will discuss the histories of old during next period  the imperator insists that this demonstration takes place within the allocated break time .  newline newline newline quintus fell back into silence , as had the rest of the class . they had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor , pondering what it could possibly be . brutus pushed the lever into position , revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms . the class gasped at the hidden fires , some edging away , while others edged closer . within minutes of the reveal , steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison . from overhead , light began to pour into the room  startling the students . newline newline newline  do you understand what has just happened ?  brutus took no time to wait for an answer , assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question .  the steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers , which in turn drove the gears to turn .  brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair , without taking a moment  s break from his speech .  these two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up . as you may have noticed , the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating , to allow for such an event as this .  newline newline newline none of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine , but the display had been completed , which was all brutus cared for . his position was not to showcase the imperator s power , but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with .  if you have any questions , you may ask professor alexander , for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than i .  the class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal , but it died down as the armoured hand of brutus rose into the air as to silence them . newline newline newline  so , as the impatient quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories , he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that i will assume you all equally have .  motioning for quintus to speak , brutus pulled back the lever to silence the roaring fires behind him .  well ... i have an understanding of our rise to glory , but i m poorly equipped to discuss the ancients .  newline newline newline brutus knew that was a lie , but appreciated the desire to know that his class shared with him .  very well , we will start with the mightiest ancients we know of : the romans , the mongols , the marvels , and the most recent to fall : the coalition of the europeans , americans , chinese , and russanadians , known as the union nations .  brutus walked over to a large granite globe , pointing at the southernmost portion of the roman leg .  this is where the glory of civilization began , with the birth of rome . we know very little of the immense empire , but we do know within years they conquered the world . the tales of julius caesar , who claimed all of gaul , igyt , and then ascending unto divus augustus to conquer a distant land called olympus . not only did he survive assassination , he then transformed a weak civilization into the strongest empire even known .  newline newline newline walking over to the now cooled steam engine , brutus paused for a moment to appreciate man  s potential .  this steam engine is nt even a seed compared to the vast tree of technological prowess the romans achieved . it s been far too many thousands of years to uncover any of their technology , but the union nations viewed the romans with such unequivocal admiration , that it must ve been breathtaking . the union nations were able to place man not only on our once whole moon , but on mars ! they lived among the stars , while creating life from machines and ripping apart the very fabric of our realm to use in war . imagine what awe inspiring power the romans must ve wielded .  newline newline newline newline  newline newline have to go , if you d like more just ask .the followers had lived on futura for 80 generations since landing the es2 . they had accumulated an impressive fossil record of the leaders , but had yet to determine what had killed them off , or why the time lag between the landings had been so much larger than projected . earth seed 1 should have preceded them by twenty years , but leader culture was proven to be over two hundred thousand years old . not only had their predecessors flourished , they had stripped the planet s surface of readily mined resources . worst of all , they left it with no historical expectation of earth seed 2 . newline newline it was positively incapacitating for the immigrating generation . they had grown up on a dying earth and taken a oneway trip to a better place , expecting to be welcomed heartily as the next generation of wives , husbands , and workers . instead , they had to cope with the reality of scraping out an existence on futura by themselves . the trip was supposed to be instantaneous , and appeared to be so from the memories of the zero gen and ship analysis . but an eternity had passed . the first hundred years were so bleak , the community eventually fractured and created religions around the leader mythos . those that stayed true to the science knew better than to idolize . the leaders had acted just like our ancestors had on earth . when it became apparent that es2 would not arrive , they played out the planet just the same way . as though it was theirs for the taking . as though no one would come after . newline newline clay knew better than to go down to the large hall for the sermon . he knew better than to give up science for faith . he knew the leaders were wasters , and he would not celebrate them . followers had done their best , and in almost 1700 years had only scrounged enough food for a baseline population of a few thousand people . he turned to the southern dust fields and walked out for some me time . thirty minutes out , he noticed the shadow . newline newline shielding his eyes from the sun while trying to see that which was partially eclipsing it , clay stood rooted for over a minute , then decided the thing was large enough that he really did nt want to risk being crushed . he ran as hard as he could , trying not to look up , occasionally failing , never slowing . an impact sent him flying . it was nt that the ground knocked him upwards . the ground simply fell away and then returned . by that time , he was falling into it pretty hard . newline newline clay briston scrambled up as fast as he could , looking at a spaceship the size of a city , terminating approximately ten meters from his face . a vertical line appeared in the nearest structure , and widened to show itself to be a bay door . five seconds later , the doorway was a thousand meters wide , and a familiar vessel was moving towards clay . he had seen it in the museum , but could nt understand what it was doing here . it was the earth seed 2 , the ship that second gen followers had taken to futura . then he saw the markings on the side of the craft . es1 . a thousand impossible thoughts vied for attention in clay s mind as the nearest hatch opened . newline newline a blond man walked up to clay , and spoke without waiting . newline newline  my name is ersten fitz . do you speak english ?  newline newline  i do . my name is clay  said clay , and they could both see the wonder reflected in each other eyes . newline newline the man smiled at clay and wept silently for a moment , then gave a wave to the massive craft that had delivered the es1 . immediately , ports opened and large walkways extruded from the sides . already , hundreds of people were walking down them towards the ground . newline newline  i am the captain of the es1 . as you may have surmised , we had technical difficulties . our warp approacher was crippled , and we had to eke out the last seventeen hundred years more or less manually . over the generations , my ancestors built this craft for the growing es1 population , which was never designed for families .  newline newline clay looked at him with an open mouth , utterly incapable of response . newline newline  but tell me how rich futura is , after all , you are our leaders . and we need you now more than ever . clay , i tell you honestly , i have brought fifty thousand hungry workers to this great planet ! i now relinquish my leadership role , we have no need for a captain !  newline newline  i would like to thank everyone who has shown such a keen interest in this story . the story is now being compiled onto rzigzagstories and i would encourage everyone to stop by and shove feedback in my face so that the story can improve and continue . i look forward to providing a deeply dark , fully harrowing tale from multiple perspectives ! newline newline thank you all again , wp ! and thanks utdotkrayz for the awesome prompt . you made my head to to real dark places : d   newline newline newline they called themselves the church of nitrogen values in the latter day free radicals . most of the followers simply referred to themselves as the free rads . like the rest of the civilized human race , they lived among the subterranean hives , venturing into the surface for daily work or long distance missions to other subterranean hives . they would espouse to the magnificent values of getting far enough away from the population centers and taking in deep lung fulls of ancient earth air . newline newline everyone thought them a pack of cultist liars . the alterations to mammillian life on the surface were uniquely horrific . fur would fall off or grow from soft mucus membranes like the mouth . horns would protrude from within their mouths and curl round jaws like saber tooth fangs gone cork screw . eyes would rupture like cysts , lings would sieze and fill with fluid , bowels would rush out in any way they could find . newline newline and that was only when lab rats were occasionally released on the surface . newline newline but the free rads gained many followers . strange , skewed young people who desperately wished for a surface life like their great grandparents had locked them all away from . as the church expanded , calls among the elders to oust this little charade of needless trouble grew into a frenzied chorus . newline newline and then it was decided . the hive council agreed that if he wise men of the free radicals could prove a maskless , nonrecycled air part of the surface existed , they would be allowed to continue preaching their frivolous nonsense . newline newline there was some hesitation , but on the insistence of many of the younger followers , the eldest of the free radicals went to the surface with some of the youngrads to wander off from the old , derelict city centers and remove their masks . senior members of the security task forces accompanied them to the ancient looking forests , long overgrown from nearly two centuries of nature running free . newline newline after two days travel the time had come . the free rads circled around their leader and , as agreed , took off their masks at the same time . the security members observed with recording devices rolling . little red circles blipped occasionally in the corner of their visual ports as they watched what happened next . newline newline the group stumbled about for a moment . each of the twenty or so youngrads did something slightly different . all of them looked to be on anguish . hands went to faces and throats , gagging and drool emitted from each of them . the eldest , the leader of the free rads held firm , nostrils flaring with breath after breath . in the recordings the voices of the security members come in quite clearly . newline newline  goddamn .  and  jesus christ .  are said frequently . newline newline one of them boys falls to his knees and his hands drop to his sides . his shoulders rattle with spasms and froth pours from his mouth as his head cranes back in a horrible angle . his eyes budge and a moment latter his spine can be heard snapping under the effort of his own back muscles constricting . another young rad flops to their side and shakes against the ground like a fresh fish from the sea on the deck of a boat . their wild and frenzied motions knock into another who tumbles and the pair seem locked in a jumbled mass of chaotic limbs . gurgles and groans fill the recording for a moment until only four figures are left standing in the circle . they tick occasionally , sometimes they wrench in strange directions , but they remain standing around the eldest free rad . he continues breathing deeply , unphazed and unchanged . newline newline his old face turns locks deeply green eyes with the nearest recording security member . he points at the bewildered cameraman and the four remaining free rads shriek in unison , leaping into the image . in seconds his mask is ripped off with a wide portion of his face , starting at the lower jaw . the mutilation is quick but not precise . blood wells up around the body and the remaining security officer turns to run . newline newline the eldest stands directly in his path as he turns . the last image is the eldest free rad reaching foreword and pulling the respirator mask off of the last security officer . all the while his old voice mutters ,  be cleansed of your old body and rejoice in the new ...  newline newline that was two months ago , when the recordings were sent to us . the surface is a far more dangerous place and the security teams are constantly on the alert for attacks on the airrecycling plants . the free rads wo nt stop until everyone has joined their family . the rest of us cower underground , carrying our masks at all times , terrified of which of our fellow neighbors might the the ones turned .30397 newline newline from

newline newline  towels are for drying things .  newline newline i have no idea what it means . i guess if it applies to you , you ll get it .they are at the dock . ben is watching the horizon , waiting for the ferry to arrive . the breeze comes cold off the water , off the lake . behind him duluth sits in a bank fog . strong beams of sunlight pierce the clouds and reflect off the windows of buildings along the waterfront . a woman takes ben s hand . emily , her hair up , her eyes wide . she is wearing a heavy down coat . newline newline are nt you cold ? she says . she takes his parka from a suitcase and hands it to him . he pulls it on over his suit . snow begins to fall from the fog and in the thin lines of morning sun the flakes sparkle like diamonds . newline newline when will

interesting . i would say the story was nt particularly gripping at first , but after the second read i wasnt as lost  haha  and thought it was better . newline newline i m having a hard time putting to words how i feel about it . i do nt know if this is the case here , but in a lot of writing i see writers describing what characters like , every detail of what they are thinking , and lots of other things that kind of pull me out of the here and now of the story . i dont get enough of a picture painted of what the story is about . stuff like that makes it hard for me to get sucked in . newline newline also the narrative voice felt a little strange at times as well . when im at my computer i can try to actually pick out examples of what i mean . newline newline overall i will say i thought that not enough actually happened in the story , which was largely due to the narrator talking about the mental mindsets that drove lost and herself to be the ways they were . newline newline if this story was to work better for me , i would have liked to see some realtime replaying of past events that would show why lost was the way he was and why the narrator was the way she was . that way i get connected to the characters and pulled into their world organically vs you just telling me  lost is like this  ,  found is like this  .it s amazing of how little you have when you do nt have internet . not that if there was any , it would do me any good . i had thrown my phone in a ditch , along with several of my other prized possessions . i could nt stand looking at them any longer , the batteries long since dead , making sleek looking paperweights . i had decided to stay in the house till someone came . i did have a lot of food . about a year s worth . yet on tuesday  well , what i decided was tuesday  i could nt stand it . my house was huge , and i was the only one left . i could nt get that thought out of my head . ever . so i left the house to see , if by any insane chance anyone else survived . little chance of seeing anyone , living or dead . it took a few days for me to find another set of structures that could possibly be defined as a town . it looked like a city once . i walked through what i thought to be the center , in search of some cans of god knows what . what i found was right out of my dreams . people . a whole group of them . i ducked behind a wall , not knowing what to expect . they all looked identical and they were all armed . i sat there for a half hour at least just staring at them . call me creepy , but when it s been about a year , people are the most amazing thing you ve seen . so when they got in a circle together i decided they were harmless . as i approched them , they pulled out their guns . i thought that this was the end , but they did nt point them at me . they pointed them at themselves . i ran up to the nearest person newline  dude ! whatwhat are you doing ? ! you ca nt give up ! tell your friends that  newline  but there s no one left.  newline  what do you mean , look at these people ! they re all here , were all alone  newline  no ones left . it s only me . all alone . i m the only one left . i m the only one left.  he popped the saftey and shot . newline that s right . i m the only one left , i realised . we are just the only one left . nothing else here . everyone else moved on . i m the only one left . all around in the circle everyone is doing the same . they were the only one left . i picked the gun up from the dead man s grasp . it was nt hard , because i am the only one left . i joined in the circle . i am the only one left . i am the only one left . newline newline newline fyi : not a writer , just a guy with an ideaanother exceptionally weird day . it s not the weirdest but it definitely belongs in the top five . let me explain to you . i am lucky . like really really lucky . in such a way that i could jump in front of a car and meet my soul mate . of course i ca nt do this because  what an irony  i seem to bring bad luck to whomever i try to help out even talk to . which brings me to why today was weird . newline newline normally i go about my day just as any other  lonely  person would . i go shopping for groceries , i sleep and eat . i even go to work even though i won the lottery multiple times  i stopped playing to give other people a chance  . but i do it alone and have done so for the last fifty years because of the aforementioned reason . newline newline but today i did nt shop and i did nt eat . i also did nt sleep . because today i was abducted by the mafia . it was unusual for me to be abducted because i am lucky and abduction seems like something only unlucky people would have to go through and i was nt one of them . at first i thought they wanted my money but i was wrong . you know how mafia guy always  well not the bosses but the rest  appear to be normal people to the unknowing ? well it turns out the guy who sells the lottery tickets is one of them . and those idiots wanted me to fill out tickets for them . well , they got arrested while going to cash them in and i got a good story to tell to nobody . where is my luck here , you ask ? you know , i am probably the luckiest person in the world but everyone has bad luck sometimes . life goes on . newline newline hope you enjoyed it , somehow i loved that prompt . it s also only the second one i have done so be harsh with your critic :  newline newline i would also love for someone more skilled than me to write about a superhero who fucks over bad guys by trying to help them .i need you to understand something before i kill you . i do not hate you . i know you do nt deserve this . newline newline but you have been drafted , against your will , into a war against an unstoppable enemy . and i am his foot soldier . my orders are barbaric , to be sure , and i consider whether they are worth following ... but i know more of the world beyond death than you could learn in a thousand lifetimes , and the one who sent me knows more than i could learn in a thousand eternities . newline newline i kill you not to punish you for your fathers  sins . i kill you to punish them . your absence , your sudden and undeserving removal from this world , will show them the futility of their struggle . it is not revenge , per se ... but they will , finally , understand the one they have been fighting . their enemy is not a statue , like one of their gods . he is a father . and the pain they have put his people  his children  through will , finally , be understood . newline newline because this is what it takes . thanks to your deaths , your fathers will relent , and his people will be freed . even that change of heart will not last , and your fathers will be crushed beneath the red sea . but they will die having chosen , once in their life , to show mercy . newline newline ... but i m doing a poor job explaining this . the father understands all this much better than i do . come closer , i ll send you to him . it wo nt hurt .i believe  genetically inferior  needs to be defined better here , or perhaps left to the imagination of the author ? newline newline now , the question is , do you mean race or species ? what we came to call race in scifi and fantasy settings are actually usually different species  except for those which can interbreed and successfully produce nonsterile offspring  halfelves , halfvulcan , etc. , which still begs the question on their origins , where the elvenhuman thing is actually scientifically not plausible , but oh well , fiction .  newline newline i think we really have to make a good bit of brainstorming here before we can create such a fictional race , because there is a point where obviously prominent genetic inferiority may cross the border to differentiate the populous as a completely separate species . newline newline let s see here  there must be different levels of genetic inferiority : newline newline 1 . one may be missing a certain chain that has no observable effects  or may , but is very hard yet not impossible to prove scientifically  . counter argument : this would literally make every individual a different race in itself due to genetic variance , including identical twins the minute their genes start to receive individual mutations . does nt really make sense . newline newline 2 . one may be missing a certain protein , causing elevated intolerance to certain substances for that particular race  ie . higher chance of lactose intolerance in east asians , elevated risk of sicklecell anemia in mediterraneans , increased risk of diabetes and asthma in africans , elevated psoriasiseczema in caucasianswhite  . counter argument : note that all these examples are an  elevated risk  and is not genetic inferiority per se . so in a fictional sense , this fictional race must have a 100  distribution of this particular genetic mutation which would make them truly genetically inferior and give them a significant disadvantage , which brings me to the third level , explained below . newline newline 3 . a race can have an attribute that is highly observable and pronounced , with very close to 100  distribution within the race , that actually provides an observable  dis  advantage over the others . fairly common examples are physical attributes that measurably give an advantage to that particular race in sports . counter argument : is there really physical advantages that cause sports success among certain races , or is it the result of a cultural thing ? do fastslow twitching muscle fibers really affect sprinting and swimming abilities , or can the unequal distribution at swimming medalists be due to the lack of training facilities ? why are east asians more prone towards things that require brain power ? is it because they have a more analytical brain due to being subjected to learn very difficult alphabets such as chinesekanji ? why are indians generally considered to be good software engineers ? can it be just a statistical advantage due to their large population , or an economic factor where intangible production that is only dependent on manpower is a much better option for a country that has a very low gdp per capita ? if whites are so much more adapted to the cold climates , how come africans can live in the northern countries ? is it really true that blacks ca nt get sunburn ?  they can , by the way  . we can never know how much the genetic differences have a role in this without taking these other factors into account . newline newline 4 . the genetic difference is so vast that cognitive abilities are severely different  mental capacity is at most at the level of a 9 year old compared to a normal human  or physical attributes give a significant advantage  can run like 95kmh rather than the 44.72kmh , that of ussain bolt , or has a maximum lifespan of 15 years , can breathe in freshwater , can photosynthesize , etc  . counter argument : well , this may imply that the other race is actually inhuman , does nt it ? newline newline so yes , this brings me back to my question : do you mean race or species ?hushed gasps still echoed through the supermarket aisles as she aligned her cart beside the checkout line . it was the same as it always had been before , the perplexed and damning and skeptical faces all cast upon her with a weight greater than the life she carried . she could feel another panic attack creeping on , that telltale blur of vision distorting and twisting them all into lumbering , ravenous beasts . how they loomed , grimaced , leered , and uttered under shrill breath , all looking to newline newline  maam ?  a clear deep voice intruded into the noise . newline newline  it s okay ,  she lied , managing a relaxing exhale to her agent s inquiry . newline newline  maam , we have bravo team at standby in the door , shall we establish a perimet ?  newline newline  no ,  she pressed down on the cart , pushing it to the register . she made quick eye contact with the teenager behind the scanner , but had to turn away as his shocked expression gnarled into just another one of the demons her mind painted .  no , it s ... it s nothing you ca nt handle , americh .  she rested her hand against her hip , and pressed her palm along the bulge extending from her abdomen .  he s kicking ,  she lied again . newline newline americh grunted , and shot a tough eye at the gathering onlookers . rolling back his shoulders , he adjusted his tie , pulling it tight in a sharp snap of his wrists , cracking them . the cashier took a step back , his jaw falling slack . newline newline  mm , miss ...  he stammered , reaching to the groceries . she did nt respond , only took a step back after giving him a second quick bout of eye contact , and then pulling away in a panicked cracking of her voice . he looked up to the agent guarding her .  nn ... so nnice to have you ccome back again , aameramerich was it ?  newline newline  agent gabriel to you ,  the agent huffed .  and you will not speak to her , do you understand ?  newline newline  yyyessir ,  the cashier quickly swung the wet wipes over the register .  yes mmister , agent gabriel .  newline newline americh s stern glaring subsided as the teenager got into the full swing of checking out all necessary items . he had much to worry about . the turin project had been going for a solid eight months of resounding success , and any residual fears of the project s disastrous implications seemed to be falling into the comfortable niches of the fundamentalist and the insane . he was nt worried about the lingering crowd sneaking guilty glances at her , or internally reveling at the baby she carried . newline newline and he could nt feel the shock necessary with a member of the public overhearing his real name instead of the gabriel moniker he shed every night before clocking out . americh looked over to the magazines , once again his client s face featured prominently and beautifully on the cover . newline newline but unlike the magazine , she had sunk low , once again falling into an inexplicable depression that usually hit her when they went outside of the cold hum of the laboratory s halls . newline newline he chuckled .  come on ,  he put his hand on her shoulder , hoping she would look up .  you said you wanted to get some fresh air and see some faces , is nt this what you wanted ?  he grabbed the magazine , laying it down in front of her .  and look at that , this picture they used of you is wonderful ! even better than the one they ran two months  newline newline  ghegh !  her shoulder twitched heavily , her head swinging quickly away from the cover picture . newline newline americh s hand lifted from her shoulder as he stepped back . his bottom jaw sank behind tight lips , but quickly reasserted into a firm smirk to fling at the gathering crowd again . a ripple of coughs and cautious steps followed a loud cracking of knuckles as the agent adjusted his tie again . newline newline  gggabgabriel ?  the clerk tentatively inquired . newline newline americh s attention did nt waver , his focus stayed firmly on the mother to be charged under his supervision .  something is wrong ? something with the baby ?  newline newline  no , he s fine , he s ...  she looked up to him , but did nt even get a glance above his neck before drooping her gaze back to the floor .  but over the last few days ,  she slowly breathed out ,  i can see ... how he sees .  she inhaled deeply , righting herself back up , the crowd of spectators lined in a ceremonious choir of demonic visages . newline newline  as in ...  gabriel s voice hung on the note for a bit . he peered down at the magazine . the headline seemed innocent enough , nothing that would cause any emotionally triggering effects . it was the exact headline the turin project wrote and sent to them , it was what their promotions department had approved verbatim . newline newline dna of jesus christ 1 month away from birth , the turin project weighs in on pure dna analysis and addresses world fears .  newline newline so why was the world so afraid ? why was she so afraid ? newline newline  mary , i  newline newline  do nt call me that ,  she coughed . newline newline a stern expression washed over americh s face .  it is your designate , mary !  he immediately caught his outburst , soothing himself . seemed the pressure was getting to him , too .  it is your name used to protect you .  the pressure of not knowing what had been causing her to act this way for the last two days .  it is to protect you and your family , mary .  newline newline  i m not her .  she clenched her fingers against her abdomen .  americh , i m just a scientist .  newline newline  we ve discussed this in the weekly briefing ,  americh interjected . newline newline  i m not actually that mother .  she sighed , peering out into the rippling sea of curious onlookers , their sheared faces contoured and woven into monstrous abominations .  but i see what he sees . and this is how he will see us .  newline newline the agent reached again for his tie , but stopped short , his knuckles tensing .  see ... us ?  he leaned over in front of her to try and look into her eyes , but she quickly clenched them shut , turning away .  see us ... as what ?  newline newline  as ...  she paused . she was a scientist . nowhere in her repertoire was there a word to describe the imps , creeps , and demons that her mind was rendering in place of everyone else . she could not call them those things . neither heretic nor beast nor nonbeliever nor even sinner . but those words , those images , were all that her maternally charged instincts could muster .  i see how ...  she threw reservations to the wind , she was too aware of how much americh pried when he knew something was wrong with her .  i see how he will judge us .  newline newline a heavy silence fell between them . the agent looked up to a face of concerned onlookers , many of whom already recording what they were seeing on their phones . newline newline  it s just his dna ,  americh tried , reciting the weekly briefings .  after all , jesus probably became the way he did because , because , well , i know you ll be a great mother too but his was really special .  she did nt respond . her hand slowly crept across the cashier counter .  and , it s not literally him , per say , you get to raise him however you want .  newline newline her hand gripped the magazine cover , sliding it towards herself . the procession of monsters around her seemed to grow and bend in impossible angles . she exhaled deeply , looking up to americh . newline newline  you can raise him to be your s ,  a blistered miasma of fetid peeling flesh spoke down to her , adjusting its tie with a crack of its festering knuckles .  have him do what you want .  newline newline she looked down at the magazine , red swathes of fiery wisps rolling over it . the soft smile melted under the warping heat , the pages curing inward to give the woman on the cover a soulsearing smile that permeated through her , the hair curling and peeling into multiple horns jutting at wild angles . the letters of the cover story burned away , word after word dissipating into twirling embers . newline newline turin project weighs in on pure dna analysis and addresses world fears .  newline newline turin ... in ... pure dna ... world fears newline newline  you can have him do what he wants to do .  newline newline the woman on the cover s mouth opened wide to a maniacal toothy grin , her inhuman jaw pulsing with laughter behind ever lick of fire wafting over it . newline newline pure ... world newline newline a muffled pop swept over the world , the simmering molten hues peeled away in a quick blink . she stepped forwards , finally making eye contact with the cashier after a quick shake of her head .  i m sorry , sir ,  she shook off the reverberating feelings of the last few minutes .  just my ... my mind is all .  and while expected of a women deeply invested in science , her words suddenly felt bitter in the prophetic sense of their delivery .  final month . sometimes my captors let me out . newline newline sometimes they can be really nice , my captors . they dont call me by my name , but they seem to have acquired some kind of a petname for me , a word that is alien in my tongue . newline newline rocky . newline newline why would anyone call anyone rocky  of all things ? newline newline despite their obvious peculiarity , they sometimes let me out , and for that i am grateful . i hate the cell . it s small , it s moldy , and the sunray barely gets through the knotty pine they use to build it . it seeps water when its raining , and somehow the material cant give me enough sun when its nice outside . newline newline they feed me , too , my captors . newline newline not regularly . sometimes i get twice a day , the food put on a metal plate that clank just after i wake up and then another portion just before i go to sleep . they do nt bother if it rains and the water mixes with the food , all of it dry and something i m not used to it . they do nt bother if sometimes the food smells weird . newline newline but sometimes , when am lucky , i get a steak . newline newline they can be really nice , my captors . most of the time they just ignore me . i have long forgotten the amount of time i ve spent on my time , but all my life , growing up , separated from my brothers and mum , all i know is the markings on the knotty pine on my cell . but ive heard voices , you know . horrible caterwailing , maniacal laughters , and occasionally , tortured wailings . newline newline tortured wailings of others of my kind . newline newline they can be nice , my captors , but i know that one of them is worse than the others . from the gaps of my trusty knotty pine , i watch the monster grow at the nice building just beside my cell . he was small and he fell down a lot and he cried even more than i did when the first time i

he laughs . rocky !  newline newline do nt hurt me !  i try to bark at him and then back away to the deepest corner of my cell , but the monster is persistent , and he has a way with his big blue eyes . he has the power of hynosis . plus , he brings his stick , which doubles his powers . newline newline rocky , good boy !  he tries to reach me . you know that there bigger dogs trying to get at you the other day . no worries though , i got rid of them all . wo nt let you get hurt , boy !  he then shows the whole front of his teeth . lets play catch !  newline newline he waves the stick right before my eyes , casting me his magic , and then i m all in now . i can only focus on the stick , just a simple stick , waving around , suddenly everything is not nearly important as that stick , and

differently . i suppose , ironically , that s the beauty of humanity . hindsight . newline newline we destroyed our planet . and to what end ? we devoured its resources to propel ourselves away from the tender embrace with which she nurtured us through our species  infancy . our cities crumbled into mines . our mountains became our makeshift workshops . newline newline we poured our existence into leaving behind our home . newline newline we created our transitships . cramming every morsel of metal , fuel , and life into these hollow husks of homes with the hope of fleeing to another that we could desecrate . but we were blind to our own downfall . newline newline never had we attempted to build anything of this scale . selfcontained cities that would lead us to new frontiers in the wake of the breakdown of our borders . a species united finally in one last endeavour to better themselves and colonise further and wider than anything we d ever known . but of course , humanity could never succeed . we fled from a planet built on failures and shortcomings . we regaled in the ancient tale of icarus , though our ambitions remained uncurbed . newline newline we lost half , perhaps more , on our launch . half a species and the work of an entire existence destroyed . through poor workmanship , perhaps . overfuelling maybe . we do nt know . and we ca nt . we can not return back to salvage . we made our decision to leave and that can not be reversed . newline newline the others ? who knows . some lost contact as we passed through the kuiper belt . others suffered failures as we passed the edge of our solar system . i write this message in the immediate aftermath of the loss of the transitship canis major . we are the last refuge of humanity that exists . newline newline our journey , too , is illfated . we have suffered a number of hull failures and are rapidly losing oxygen . our onboard life support systems suggest a remaining population of around four percent of those who boarded . we can only isolate oxygen supply to enough vitachambers for an estimated 0.3  of our remaining passengers . an insufficient number to successfully carry out our mission to reach and colonise distant worlds . newline newline and so we , the crew of the transitship andromeda of earth , have taken upon ourselves , with heavy hearts , the decision to power down . to preserve our systems  energy with the aim of sustaining the life of this message in the faint glimmer of cold and distant hope that another spacefaring civilisation may encounter it many millennia from now . to serve as a warning against the allure of the abyss . newline newline humanity spent its childhood reaching for the sky . when we held it in our hands , we found naught but empty space . newline newline signing out , newline newline admiral laurence beckettthe smell of the salt was enough to feel me with trepidation . the arrival , all it did was add to the tension . the salt breeze had a way of bringing back all my darkest memories . but i persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline sand . i remembered , randomly , hayden christensen s infamous line . a smile briefly danced across my face , replaced quickly by my stoic scowl . huh , a scowl never had thought of myself as a scowler . had nt even ... but there was no use dragging up old memories , especially now that i was ankle deep in the sand that was less sand and more rock , mostly pebbles that grated on my feet . all the movies had made it seem like bringing shoes was a bad idea , it seems they were wrong . i knelt , and scooped up the coarse sand , and let it spill through my fingers . that had been my life all those years ago . it did nt matter now . correction : it should nt matter now . but somehow the memories did . but i persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline forward . the lighthouse , the destination , stood up ahead on top of a craggy cliff . i could see from here the waves crashing on rock , a perpetual war mother nature waged against herself . heh . humanity was so insignificant to her that she needed to fight herself to pass the time , she was the only worthy foe . she was the chess master that had nt considered the possibility of challenging the child in the room , opting to play both sides . perhaps this was why it was loosely known as the suicide cliffs . what better place to end things than a war zone ? no one could survive a fall . least of all ... i pushed against the memories again . they threatened to come back again , but i persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline  this better be worth it ,  i muttered . in my heart , i knew it would nt be . i knew what the end held . the lighthouse s doors failed to creak as i pushed them open , they really should ve , i felt . but the decrepit place did nt need help in creating such an atmosphere . the place had been like this when i was a child , when me and my brother ranged over these cliffs and this lighthouse . back then , of course , the armchair had yet to collapse into a pile of tinder , and you could still see how the leather used to be a rich burgundy . i remembered the time we lit a fire in the grate and suddenly it felt like , like , like we were at home , like the sea was nowhere near and there was only the rich , homely warmth of lighthouse . but the sea had claimed this place as well , and the grate was damp , the armchair a rotted husk , even the painting a curled husk . but i persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline the stairs , unlike the doors , creaked as i carefully crept up them . i told myself it was because i did nt want to break them under my weight . i knew it was a very different kind of fear . the second floor had been a bedroom , once upon a time . it d also been the home of my dreams of sailing . my brother , he was the elder , which meant he was captain , grand captain of the boat that was this bed . but that was fine with me . as a common sailor , i got to report  on the disasters incoming . i got to watch how he solved the unsolvable crises . but that was all childhood . that was before he turned our dreams into a reality . but i persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline the final few flights led to storage , mostly . the lighthouse itself was old , from all the way back in the history books when it required actual wood for the fire to rage . all the wood was gone now , gone like him . the elder brother , he d felt the call most keenly . our family ... there was a reason we lived near the sea , near this old place . the navy received a commendable captain that day . me , i d been left behind . left to endure the infinite years that remained of my education . by then , i was always the weird creature of the sea . but that song has been sung a thousand times . i remembered how the bullies would try to return me to the sea ,  the same way one would a dead fish . i remembered the nights warming myself by a fire after the bad days . but i persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline the open air seemed oppressively freeing , after my stint within the lighthouse . the light itself was ready to go , the wood preserved by the ancient s technology to make sure the place was always ready for its duty . and inside , a package . we had discovered the place , a place long forgotten by time , and made it ours . and that included putting our childish dreams in this place of forgotten fire . i pulled out the battered shoebox no more children would roam this place after what happened here , no parent could possibly allow it and contemplated it for a long moment . but i could not open it . those dreams were no longer meant for me . it would hurt too much . i simply carried the box back down those stairs . i had persevered . i had made a promise to a friend . newline newline but she was nt really a friend . not really . she was his widow . my brother and her , they d married when the war had come and he d been sent to serve . he d weathered the fires of war and the fury of the sea for her , and he d returned to her many a year later . in the time after the ... when she d gone from being a wife to a widow , we d grown closer . somehow , our grief pulled us together , cemented our lack of feelings towards each other . we became friends of a sort , the kind of friend where the idea of spending time away from the other is only marginally less appealing than the alternative . she d driven me out here , she needed  the last of his things ,  she d finally decided to move on . and so i handed her the box and turned around . newline newline  where you goin  ?  she asked quietly . newline  to think .  newline newline

i sat , letting my feet dangle off the edge . newline newline finally , i let the memory return , and i felt the crushing guilt hit me for the hundredth time of how he had saved me , his stupid little brother who d decided the bullies were too much for him to bear , of how he d caught me , just before i reminded the world of why this place was suicide cliffs , of how in pulling me up his foot slipped , of how i d managed to make one last unsolvable crisis for him . but mother nature was never one that he could solve , and i remembered how powerless i felt watching the sea take him and throw him against the cliffs ... the fury of the sea . newline newline the box , the box sitting in her car , it held our dreams , but really it held our promises to each other . he was my captain , i

newline  it is .  newline newline  can you tell me anything else about the situation , or how you found her ?  newline newline  she was in an alley a couple of blocks from my house , dead when i found

questions .  any idea who would have wanted to hurt her ?  newline newline  yeah , i know who it was .  he had nt once made eyecontact with me . his head was resting on his right hand , eyes pointed to the tiled floor . he leaned over and reached his other hand behind his back and pulled out a gun , which he offered me in his outstretched palm . newline newline  and i d like to report another

face . his hair was unkempt , and he wore a leather jacket over a plain tshirt and jeans . he looked like he was barely out of high school . newline newline  hhi , i m here to apply for a hero s license ?  the kid asked . newline newline george cleared his throat , and motioned the kid over to seat in one of the mahogany chairs in front of the desk .  sit down , kid ,  he muttered . the young man hustled over , and sat down in front of the desk . newline newline george gave him a once over again , and marcy was looking at him , too . usually , potential heroes came in wearing their costumes , so they could display their powers or abilities . this guy looked ordinary . newline newline  you said you want to apply for a hero s license ?  george asked . the kid nodded .  yes , sir . uh , sorry , i should introduce myself . my name s daniel . daniel wheeler .  newline newline  alright , daniel . so , uh , here s this form  it s just a general application , it s mainly so we can categorize you . how you got your powers , if any , any special abilities , special skills   newline newline george was reaching into a drawer of his desk when daniel interrupted him .  oh , i do nt have any powers .  george looked up at him , and then pulled the application from the drawer .  that s alright . you do nt have to shoot laser beams to be a hero . we ve got some masked vigilantes running around with bow staves and boomerangs and shit like that .  newline newline  i do nt have any of that either ,  daniel replied . he was smiling this nervous grin when george looked up at him . newline newline  do you have any special skills ?  george asked . daniel shook his head . george slapped his hand on the blank application form , then looked over it to refresh his memory .  were you exposed to gamma radiation and imparted with powers as a result ?  newline newline  nope .  newline newline  cosmic intervention ?  newline newline  no .  newline newline  human experimentation ?  newline newline  nah .  newline newline  do you have money ?   newline newline  no , i m broke . before you ask me anything else  i really do nt want to waste anyone s time  i do nt have any money , no powers , no special skills , or abilities . i m a normal , human man , with normal parts . hell , i can barely fight .  newline newline george looked at him incredulously , then dropped his hands to his desk with a slam .  then what are you doing here ?   newline newline  i want to be a hero ,  daniel replied . newline newline  a hero ?  kid , i m sorry , but without powers or anything , the h.r.a . wo nt allow you to get a hero s license .  newline newline  you do nt have to have powers to be heroes , you just said that . there s masked vigilantes with weapons running around the city fighting crime !  daniel s voice had risen a few decibels , and george was taken aback by how quick he had gotten upset . newline newline  that s true , but those vigilantes have their own weapons , and know how to use them . the government is confident in their proficiency . do you have any weapons ? do you even have a gun ?   newline newline  well , no , i do nt . but i want to help people .  newline newline  listen , kid ,  george began , rubbing his temples with his forefinger and thumb lightly ,  i d really love to help you . but without anything special  as defined by the government , or even knowledge of combat , or weaponry ... i ca nt in good conscious give you a license . i m sorry .  newline newline  is nt there a program i can enter to be considered for experimentation ? or super soldier training ? i m eighteen years old , i just want to be able to do something .  newline newline  eighteen ? kid , your whole life is ahead of you , why do you want to throw it away ? those programs usually only accept people in peak physical condition . even if you were eligible for a program like that , the experimentation is agonizing and you re away from your family . why are nt you going to school ? or getting a normal job ?  newline newline daniel sighed , and sat up slightly in his chair . he reached into his back pocket , and produced a piece of paper folded up . he sat it on the edge of the desk , and slid it towards george on the other side . newline newline george picked it up and unfolded it . it was a medical diagnosis . daniel s name in the top left corner . pancreatic cancer , stage four . newline newline  prognosis says i ve got maybe a year . i wanted to do something in that time . make the world a better place somehow . i cca nt join the military , or  or i would . i feel like i d be wasting my time in school or some deadend job . i refused treatment , my mom worked three jobs just to raise me and ii ca nt burden her with my medical bills .  newline newline daniel was crying now , his eyes puffy and red and leaking tears down his cheeks . marcy was watching the scene unfold , her eyes wide . george continued to stare at the diagnosis form when daniel reached across the table and took it back . newline newline  just forget it . i m sorry for wasting your time ,  daniel said . he stood up , brushing his face with the sleeve of his jacket .  thanks for your help .  newline newline he turned and started towards the door . george did nt know what it was  that this boy wanted so badly for his life to matter in the short time he had remaining , or the thought of someone trying to make the world a better place for his daughter , or the fact that daniel s spirit sparked something within him  the same fascination he had had as a child , growing up and reading comic books . newline newline  wait , kid . come back over here . fill out this application , and we ll attach your medical documentation to it . there are experimentation programs that are looking into applicants with extenuating medical history , and i d say stage four cancer fits the bill .  newline newline daniel turned around , and was crying , and then smiling . he crossed the room back to the desk and sat down . george handed him a pen , and he excitedly began marking every bubble marked no  with a check mark on his application . newline newline maybe there was nothing special about him . but he certainly had a hero s spirit .preface : this short story is told from the perspective of the villain . newline newline it was a bright , sunny , uneventful day when it came to town . i was at home frantically  and some may say neurotically  organizing my living room for the inlaws who were visiting . i was on vacation , hoping to catch a break from the elusive  cheetah mask .  mind you she  yes , she s a woman ,  had recently moved into springfield cove and debunked my villainous plans immediately . the bloody pain in the tush even got her own newspaper section dedicated to her ! well , anyways , nearly every other day it was the same . i create some sort of robotic foe to reclaim my city and she uses some sort of hacking or telepathy skills to destroy it . like i had said , i was on vacation to my second home where my wife raised our twin daughters . i was always away on  business trips  when conquering the town that was once my own . right as i was dusting our useless doghorsething knickknack i received a call . it was from cheetah mask . newline newline i can easily recall it  newline  what do you want ?  i d asked , obviously peeved . newline  there s a problem pertaining to us both ,  she managed to squeak out newline  and i need your help .  newline newline sorry but i m cutting this short . i m not done , but i must be getting to bed . i ll finish this in the morning as soon as i can newline newline applejack244 newline really ? is this it ?  newline newline i stared aghast at the petulant little shit . is this it , indeed . the cheek of it . this world ... this masterpiece ... had been built to her precise instructions . i had become like the ancient magratheians of douglass addams  hitchhiker saga . i am a god among men , a builder of worlds . and this impertinent little slime had the gall to critique my craft ? newline newline  with all due respect , miss laroux ... i followed your instructions to the letter and completed this project to the same standard as any other world i have made .  newline  oh , is that so ? then do pray tell ... where are the animals ?  newline  what animals ?  newline  i demanded a paridise world ... where is the beautiful sea life ? where are the majestic beasts of the plains ?  newline  you never mentioned animals ... you wish to keep pets here ?  newline  well , i ve seen your other works ... life evolved there . people rave about how the unique environments you create breed the most eyecatching creatures , each grown from their own unique starting point found only on that world .  newline i scowled , a frustration beyond words building in my gut .  madam ... you asked that there be ruby mountains and beaches of crimson sand . in fact , you requested that everything ... to some extent , be made of red crystal , be it ruby , garnet or red jade . do you have any idea how hard it is to formulate jade that grows red ? besides ... if every single inch of this world is red gemstones ... what exactly you propose your animals would eat ?  newline  what about those trees ?  newline i walked over to the forest of red leaves . gently , i snaped one off and held it up for her to see . newline  maam ... you asked for forests of ruby ... so that is precisely what i gave you ...  newline newline i got up to leave and pause , starring at the crimson ocean . that one , she had nt specifically asked for , but i do so hate it when the sea clashes with the land . a properly planned colour scheme is important to me . i sighed and left the shocked young heiress to her ruby prison . her payment had already been wired through , i doubted she had been planning on leaving her  paridise  any time soon anyway . newline i was not without mercy , so i gave her one parting gift . it was a small thing , no more than she could get by on . a few months rations , and a few seeds for her to plant the next crop . she would be ready to harvest just before she ran out of food . i may have hated her , but i am not a monster . newline newline sometime later i returned to the little red gem in its tiny pocket dimension . years had passed within this bubble and the ruby forest has receaded . in it s place are the plants that i gave her . and beneath one tree sat the withered form of an aged rosalyn laroux . her skeletal form was slumped against the tree , but she smiled when she saw me . she told me i have nt aged a day and i chuckled . newline i confess that , from my perspective at least , it has nt even been a day since i left . the old woman smiled and mumbled something about how it  figures  and then she asked me something no one else has asked me before or since . newline newline  what do you do with planets once the client has no further use for them ?  newline newline when i told her the truth , that i clean up any damage done by the client and then release it into open space , she smiled . she asked if i could finally add animals to this one . i think that perhaps it was the least i could do ...you could nt write about a writing prompt about meta writing prompts ... you do nt ever write writing prompts , you just read them , and do nt even have the balls to comment or upvote ... even the good ones . newline newline besides most of the time you get better enjoyment from the titles than what people write ! look past posts on the front page , and only click the ones that really interested you . newline newline you almost never scroll down to find a story that might be hidden in the comments section that never made it to the top ... or was posted to recently ... if the prompt is 9h ... the top one is always the best ... newline newline newline but then , every once in a while , you do scroll down . newline newline you read that one that speaks directly into your soul ! newline newline you get so enthralled with the constant parallels to your own life you are nt sure if this is truly meta , psychic , or some crazy hooey ! newline newline you almost forget that you are writing the story , not reading it .i still think about you newline newline every single day newline newline where we sat on the grass newline newline surrounded by strangers newline newline blue on our faces newline newline laughter on our lips newline newline  newline newline i still think about you newline newline every single moment newline newline driving down the highway newline newline with the ocean rushing past newline newline voices raised to the sky newline newline nobody could touch us newline newline  newline newline i still think about you newline newline every single second newline newline sitting on top of a hill newline newline doing nothing at all newline newline sitting , just to sit newline newline enjoying the moment newline newline  newline newline i still think about you newline newline i think about your last day newline newline i think about your last moment newline newline what were you thinking ? 1 newline newline there s one every year . some bright spark gets their mitts on some tech they re not meant to have , and next thing you know the whole timeline is falling apart . after the hitler incident , it was generally agreed that time travel had to be regulated for the safety of well , everything . newline newline we discovered how to turn back time well , turn back is the wrong phrase . more sort of shift through time . insert a small package at a point in history . or a person . at first , historical tourism was all the rage . they were careful , of course . historically accurate clothing , strict rules about interaction . newline newline we should have known it would nt be enough . one man with one time machine caused the hitler incident , and that nearly wiped out the planet . after that , a universal ban on time travel was put in place . but sometimes someone stumbles across a piece of old technology that the enforcers missed and all of a sudden the world is cracking apart . newline newline that s when they call me . newline newline the caddy was invented shortly after the ban . the eggheads called it the cdd , or chronological disturbance detector , but the field guys shortened it to the caddy . it scans for alterations , ripples in time , disruptions to the original timeline . the caddys detect someone messing around with history and find out where  and more importantly , when  the disruptions originate from . newline newline then we go in . our objective ? preserve the original timeline , at any cost . avoid detection , and above all , do not attempt to alter the past . our official name is the anomaly prevention task force . those who know about us call us the wardens . newline newline this was a simple op . 1500 ad , short burst of temporal energy originating from a small village in southern england . no big changes yet , but who knew what someone with the knowledge of the future could do ? newline newline gear was standard fare for this century . the recall switch was concealed in the hilt of a dagger , tucked away behind my back . no obvious weapons , although the concealed highpower laser in a metal bracelet beneath my tunic s sleeve could eliminate any threat quickly enough . newline newline i arrived a few hours west of the origin point . the caddy had scanned historical maps of the region and dumped me relatively far from civilisation . it would be a quick walk , at the very least . newline newline wish the goddamn things could make me invisible , i thought to myself as i began to walk across the hills . the tiny village where the anomaly had occurred was nt exactly enormous . someone from the future , untrained in historical camouflage , would stick out like ... newline newline well , like someone from at least the year 2385 in 1500 . i sighed , and looked up . the sun was high in the sky , and a little chip in my skull told me it was 1:37 in the afternoon . middle of the day . no chance the anomaly could hide . newline newline standard procedure when we find an anomaly is simple . first step is to take out the originator . that usually means killing them , or returning them to their time of origin and wiping their memories . next , we measure the contagion , see how far they ve changed history . too far , and we have to scour . newline newline ever hear of the bubonic plague ? that was an example of how far we can go . there was no telling how far the advanced knowledge had been spread , and a plague was the only inconspicuous way to eliminate any that might have been exposed . newline newline sometimes i hate my job . newline newline the village was near now , and i could see a crowd gathered in the centre of town . i walked down through the wooden houses with their thatch roofs and wondered  why here ? what kind of thing was the wouldbe meddler hoping to change in some shithole in the middle of nowhere ? if you want to change the future , why not one of the big cities ? if this traveller had popped up in london , i might have been in 1500 for days tracking them down , so why here ? newline newline as i got closer , the smell of smoke hit me . a group of villagers were gathered round some kind of totem pole no , not a totem , a stake . and they were chanting oh . newline newline  burn the witch ! burn the witch !  the whole village seemed to be carrying up the cry , and i looked on as i saw a young girl around twenty , from the looks of it , although with the cosmetics we had now it was impossible to tell , really . newline newline i raised my eyebrows . most meddlers try to blend in , to varying degrees of failure , but this girl had nt even tried , or if she had it was for the wrong millenium . i was nt an expert in historical fashion one of the eggheads handled the costumes , but it looked like early twentyfirst century attire . newline newline someone had packed for the wrong trip . that , or ... newline newline no . just some kid playing around with something she could nt understand . newline newline i knew the risks . we all did . if the situation is set to resolve itself with minimum disruption , let it . conservare praeteritis futura supresse . preserve the past so the future may survive . that was the wardens  motto . newline newline  conservare praeteritis futura supresse ,  i muttered under my breath , turning to go . i could nt watch her burn . i d seen too much burning . she was screaming now , begging out to god , to her family , to anyone to help her . the man holding the torch raised it high , and the crowd cheered . newline newline i felt sick , and turned my head away .  conservare praeteritis futura supresse ,  i whispered to myself again and again , a frenzied mantra that failed to block out the screams .  conservare praeteris futura supresse . conservare praeteritis futura supresse , conservare praeteritis futura supresse , conser oh , fuck it .  newline newline i spun around and ran forwards , leaping up onto the platform . a few villagers were shoved out of the way , and the man holding the torch turned to me with a look of outrage on his face . newline newline  stop ,  i said , staring him in the eyes . he was not a young man , looking to be in his late forties , maybe older . in these times , practically an ancient . hair falling out , callused hands thin and skeletal . sick , probably fatal . newline newline  what s thine business here , stranger ?  asked the man , holding the torch out in front of him .  this witch came from nowhere , rising from hell it  newline newline i punched him in the face . i should nt have , and the director would give me a tonguelashing for that , but like hell was i watching someone else burn . i jumped up onto the pyre , nearly losing my footing as the dry kindling crunched and cracked beneath my feet . i grabbed the recall dagger from behind my back , then reconsidered my plan . i could nt recall us out of here . that would create unnecessary temporal contagion and endanger our mission . newline newline but the dagger concealing the recall switch was pretty damn sharp . newline newline it was nt until i d finished slicing through the ropes that i realised i was enjoying this . the head villager had gotten back up , and was glaring at us with a stare that promised several brutally violent fates , all of which were best to be avoided . newline newline i grabbed the girl s hand and we ran . the villagers were chasing after us now , yelling angry curses in middle english , but the wardens had a very good fitness program . newline newline it was a while before we managed to lose them , sprinting into a forest . once the shouting and cursing had gone , we stopped . the girl looked up , panting and wheezing , before looking up at me .  thank y  she said , and that was as far as she got before i pinned her against a tree , recall dagger at her throat . newline newline  what ,  i growled , doing my best menacing agent voice ,  in the absolute bloody fuck do you think you re doing ? do you think that history is your playground ? do you have any idea of the damage that i could have caused to the fabric of existence by saving you back there ?  newline newline the girl stopped , and began to cry . newline newline good job . my work saved the lives of trillions . newline newline  wwho are you ?  she sobbed .  what s going on ? why is there a knife at my throat ?  i did nt answer at first , but i did lower the knife . newline  you re where you signed up for . 1500 ad , middle of bumblefucknowhere . now , what year are you from ?  newline newline the girl looked up , confused .  year ? 2016 . the fuck do you mean what year ? 1500 ? are you crazy ?  this was a shock . was she trying to play innocent ? 2016 matched up with the clothes she was wearing , but they had nt developed time travel for another 300 years , and it had nt been perfected until 100 after that . newline newline slowly , i put down the knife .  why do nt you tell me how you got here ?  i asked , somewhat more softly than i had before .  how are you in this time period ?  the girl looked around the forest , taking a deep breath .  i was i was out at a party . i was walking home , and there was this pain , like being winded and a light like someone had shoved the sun in my eyes . i thought i d been hit by a car , but then i woke up in that place and 1500 ? ii ve traveled back in time . holy shit , i ve traveled back in time !  newline newline  no , you ca nt kill hitler , screw helen of troy not worth it , trust me  or engage in any other historical misadventures . god , you really are from 2016 , are nt you ? and you do nt know how you got here , which means  newline newline i stopped .  what s your name ?  i asked . the girl looked up , confused .  emily ,  she said , taking a deep breath .  oh fuck me , this is really real , is nt it ?  newline newline i held out my hand , helping emily up .  i m agent robert quincy , anomaly prevention task force , and we are in very grave danger .  she looked up at me , quizzically .  no shit ,  she said , raising an eyebrow ,  was it the angry mob that gave it away ?  newline newline i shook my head , turning in a slow circle , balancing on the balls of my feet .  you did nt come here of your own volition . you were sent here , from a time that does nt fit to a time you do nt belong . and i do nt think you came here alone .  newline newline  meaning ?  she asked , standing up and looking out into the rapidly darkening forest . newline newline  meaning , emily from 2016 , you re not the anomaly . you re the bait , the lure , and i bit down hook , line and sinker .  newline newline it was around that time that i heard a hammer click back on an oldfashioned combustion weapon . newline newline  well ,  i muttered to myself ,  shit .  newline i m not talking too much chaos . the landlord would figure it out .  i paced back and forth . newline newline the monster looked back at me .  what chaos would you like ?  newline newline  go sleep in his closet for a week or two .  newline newline  i am going to assume you re being silly . not leaving .  newline newline i sighed .  what ? what shall i do ?  newline newline  well ,  the monster said .  if you really want to get him in trouble , introduce him to reddit .  newline newline i sighed .  and ?  newline newline  post in rlegaladvice to ask about how you can remove a roommate who is bothering you . then , ask utragopanic about the third thing .  newline newline  i would rather live , grandma ,  i responded . newline newline  okay , maybe not the second part . tell utragopanic she s awesome instead .  newline newline i shook my head and closed the door . i opened my phone and called a lawyer .your prompt hits really close to home , op . since i remember i always had what you would call an  imaginary friend  called dave . i could never really see or hear him , but he talked to me . not all the time , when i was little i only  heared  him occasionally , but the older i grew the more present he became . newline newline first i thought dave was what other people call their conscience , but he took more and more control . i could nt sleep and had crazy headaches . i thought i might be schizophrenic or something , i even told my parents that i m gon na institutionalise myself . that was when they showed me the medical papers . dave was no imaginary friend , he was my twin brother , ingrow in my head , still in a fetal state . the doctors said the riscs of open brain surgery were to high , they thought i would somehow naturally digest him . but he s still there . and i ca nt take it anymore . newline newline i ve seen where he is on the xrays . on my left cerebrum . he has pain and he makes me feel it too . this morning i shaved my head . the drill lies next to me on my desk . it only takes about 1.2 inches . newline newline i tried clearing my mind browsing reddit a bit but i ca nt take this pain any longer . wish me luck . oh , hello ,  i said . newline newline the little girl who stood there in the door blinked , nonplussed , as typical children do when answering the door . newline newline  um ... is your mom or dad home ?  newline newline  mooom !  the little girl shouted . newline newline a lovely woman came to the door , rolled her eyes a little as she said ,  thank you , marie . go play with your brother .  newline newline the little girl ran off , and the woman turned her attention to me .  can i help you ?  newline newline  i hope so ,  i said .  my car broke down a bit away . i need to get a hold of my insurance so i can get the tow arranged , but i need to borrow a computer . i do nt suppose you have one with internet , do you ... ?  newline newline she stepped aside as she opened the door .  oh , well , sure . come on in . ben !  she shouted .  can you come help with the computer ?  newline newline she said in confidentiality ,  my son is a wiz at these things . the rest of us do nt know how to even turn the thing on , so ... ah , here he is .  newline newline  yes , mom ?  newline newline  ben ,  the mother said ,  this gentleman needs to use the computer . can you help him with it ?  newline newline he eyed me suspiciously ... does he know ... ?  i pondered , but shook it out of my mind , lest he get a clue from my face . newline newline  yeah ... sure ... cmon upstairs .  newline newline  thank you very much , maam , and young sir !  i said enthusiastically . newline newline  oh , it s no bother !  said the mother .  can i get you anything ?  newline newline i shook my head .  no , thanks , i m ok at the moment . thank you for the offer !  newline newline ben led me upstairs to the study , where the computer was . it was a standard computer , with a small screen , mouse , keyboard , printer ... the usual . newline newline he turned the computer on , and got it logged on . he sat there at the computer , looked at me , and said  where do we need to go ?  newline newline  havershaw insurance .  newline newline he did a google search , and found the company s website . i motioned for him to click the request a tow .  he did , and then turned to me ...  looks like i need your account and password .  newline newline  oh ,  i said in disappointment .  i do nt know it ... let me see the keyboard , maybe i ll remember .  newline newline i typed in a few times , not getting it right , naturally . newline newline  i need to get in my email ,  i said .  is that ok ? i ll get account info emailed to me .  newline newline  ca nt you use your smartphone ?  ben asked . newline newline  oh , i only have a flip phone . do nt need anything else ... well , until now , of course .  newline newline ben looked at me with teenage exasperation . newline newline  hey , seriously , just making phone calls is expensive enough on this thing , dude ,  i said with a defensive tone . newline newline  ok , fine , whatever , just ... i want to get back to my game . can you hurry up ?  newline newline  sure thing .  i navigated to my email , started to log in ... newline newline  ben !  said the little girl ... marie , was it ?  i want to play my game now . are you done ?  newline newline ben looked a bit worried as he said ,  no , do nt touch it . i ll be right down !  newline newline  no , i want to play the barbie game now !  newline newline  no ! !  and with that , ben took off , young teen priorities in place . newline newline perfect . newline newline i set about my work . i examined the way things were connected to the computer . the mouse and keyboard were old school ps2 connectors ... i ll leave them alone . newline newline but the printer , joypad , and even the speakers ? yes ... this will be glorious .  newline newline i disconnected each one . i had to hurry , lest ben come back too soon and ruin everything . newline newline my long , thin tweezers came out ... and i carefully attached my special little clips into the connectors . i then put all the cords back in the computer ... no one would be the wiser . they were engineered to not trigger  until enough time had passed , when the clips would short across random pins . time enough to escape . newline newline i closed the browser windows i was using , and just left the computer there to await the fates that were coming to them . newline newline i went downstairs .  hello ? anyone ?  newline newline the woman came to me .  oh . are you done ?  newline newline  yes , maam , thank you . the tow truck will be at my car soon , i left them instructions , as it s not far ,  i said .  thank you so much for the help !  newline newline she said ,  well , do nt thank me , thank ben .  newline newline  oh , i would , but he was really wanting to get back to his game . it s fine ,  i said , as i opened the door to exit . newline newline  i ll tell him . are you sure you do nt want to wait here ?  newline newline  no , it s ok . they ll be here shortly , and i have stuff in the car . just in case , yknow ?  i smiled as i exited the home .  thank you again , so much .  newline newline with that , i headed out to go to my perfectly working car , and drive off , tickled pink that soon ... the usb devices  and the computer s ports too , with luck !  would be dead , and nobody the wiser as to why . newline newline i drove on into the night , looking for my next serial bus victims ... maybe a best buy ?cody was two and a half when he died . we knew , of course , that he was sick . we d taken him to treatments and smoothed back his hair while he vomited into the plastic bins . we d seen the test results and talked to every doctor , but michael and i knew better than to expect much . he d been born with it , and two and a half years was quite a time to survive it . newline newline we held him as he died . he might not have even known , but his hand was wrapped in mine . his small , small hand that i should have seen grow big and strong . i felt it tight and then looser , looser , looser , until it fell limp . newline newline there are many things i do nt believe in . i do nt believe in god , i do nt believe in magic . i do nt believe that everything happens for a reason . but i do believe in science . i did then , too . and i had heard about the theory of parallel universes in college . newline newline so i researched . i quit my job and went back to school . i got a phd  not that it did me much . i watched my marriage fall apart because of my obsession . i watched my husband drag me into therapy session after therapy session and saw the uncertain looks shared between skeptics and i felt his absence next to me in bed . through all of this , i just could nt let go of cody . newline newline and then i found it . it s said in science one never knows when the next big breakthrough is ten minutes away . that was how it was . one moment i was standing in my lab close to tears . newline newline the next , i was watching myself cry at a table in a caf . michael , my ex husband , sat with his hand over mine . they were silent tears , streaming down my face in white hot streams . i wondered if any of the passers by could see alternate me crying , or if they cared , or if they did nt notice . newline newline i hid my face behind a menu and listened to me ... to susan ... and her husband talk . newline newline  we can try again ,  this michael s voice was kind . newline newline  no ,  susan said .  i do nt want to try again .  newline newline  suzy   newline newline  no . you know what they tell you in there ? to push . to push and push and push and it s so painful and it s so horrible because you re tearing your body to shreds but it s okay because after it s done you get a baby . you get a little tiny baby and you take it home and its yours and you get to love it and name it and raise it . but ours ... ours ...  newline newline  died ,  michael s voice cracked .  i know . i know . but we can try again .  newline newline  i ca nt ,  susan s voice was high pitched .  i ca nt feel this pain again .  newline newline he died here too ,  i thought . at that moment i wanted nothing more than to run to the alternate susan and wrap my arms around her . but there was no time for it . i had to find him . i had to see him . i had to watch him grow up . newline newline but every time he died . each world i went to saw him dead before his third birthday . i listened to myself  a shadow of myself , a parallel of myself  sob and cry and scream and stoically take the death of her child . i watched michaels and susans divorce and mend and try again and have healthy , beautiful babies . i saw myself in twenty years , in thirty , in forty . newline newline i only saw cody once more . he was twenty . he had his father s hair . he had my nose . he was a beautiful boy , and he was mine . newline newline he studied physics . he was recruited by the department of energy . he worked in a lab and made the deadliest weapon of all . something that would destroy everyone  the innocent , the guilty , the women and the children and the religious and the godless . newline newline he knew what he was making . he knew what he was doing . i watched him as a lab assistant who looked ,  just like my late mother , it s amazing .  newline newline on the day he completed it , i hugged him . i told him i loved him . newline newline i understood why he had died in every other universe . newline newline i understood what i had to do to make it right . newline newline   newline newline for other stories , check out rcelsius232 looks like a suicide to me ,  frankie said , kicking the pistol lying by the victims hand underneath the black leather .  definitely a suicide.  newline newline  you think so ?  tony said , kneeling down and appearing to study the body . it was clearly not a suicide , his back almost shredded apart by bullets , but frankie was hoping tony would ignore that minor detail . he was also hoping he wouldn  t notice the various slice marks , the threatening letter lying by the body , or the fact that there were a second set of footprints discovered by the body that were identical frankie  s .  you think this was a suicide ?  newline newline  sure do ,  frankie said , maneuvering himself so that he was blocking tony  s vision .  i  d say he wrote himself an ambiguous suicide note , wandered around a few times , and then killed himself.  newline newline  seems like a weird way to go out ,  tony said , pushing himself back up to his feet .  you know , shooting himself half a dozen times in the chest , before finally taking one to the face . most suicides tend to be right to the head.  newline newline  yeah ,  frankie said , glancing at the black , leather couch . on second thought , he really shouldn  t have kicked the pistol underneath . while it was probably a good idea to try to hide the murder weapon , the fact that it was also his service pistol remained true . it would probably come off as a bit strange should chief , or anyone else , notice that his holster was emptyespecially in connection with his matching footprints .  he probably was just suffering , you know ? like that comedian who stabbed himself multiple times to try to die . that kind of thing.  newline newline  right ,  tony said , kneeling back down and picking up the  suicide  note . frankie fell to the floor and fished out his pistol , wrapping his palm around its grip and slipping it back into his holster . he thrust himself back up , confirmed that tony had not seen , and resumed looking as innocent as possible .  have you seen this note ?  newline newline  yeah ,  frankie said , avoiding eye contact .  i saw it . gross stuff . all about how he wanted to die and didn  t feel safe.  newline newline  says here that he  would be killed for not paying for protection fees ,   frankie said .  you sure this was a suicide ?  newline newline  absolutely ,  frankie said , hoping that tony wouldn  t notice that it was written in his easily identifiable cursive handwriting . he knew he shouldn  t have left it by the body . he just didn  t expect the police to respond so quickly , thought he  d be able to clean up after himself and take a quick shower before they arrived . after all , he was the officer assigned to the area , he didn  t think tony would be on call then . yet there he was , standing by the body as frankie left the steamfilled bathroom and did his best not to draw attention to his stillmoist hair . newline newline  let  s get this straight ,  tony said , lowering the note and eyeing frankie up and down .  you think the guy walked in here on his own , wrote an aggressive letter about being killed if he didn  t pay for protection , and then shot himself multiple times in the head and back , all as a suicide ? oh , and let  s not forget the that he also left a second set of footprints ?  newline newline  right ,  frankie said , nodding slowly . newline newline  okay ,  tony said .  works for me . case closed . let  s go get some pizza.  newlineoh god . not again . well , looks like another alien attack this week . that s the third time this year . plus that monster attack in february , and it s only april . i guess i m taking the subway to work . pity , with the weather turning nice i was going to bike in . and the station is still 3 blocks from work , so i ve got to run that distance . i d call in , but i need that vacation time to visit mom next month . newline newline let s see , what to wear ? with alien attacks no one will really care about my outfit much . need something comfortable for running . definitely not the pumps , where are my sneakers ? denim jacket , what else ? oooh , this blouse is sturdy and looks good with these jeans . anything else before i head out the door ? i hope mace works on these assholes . better grab the baton , just in case . and hand sanitizer . last time i forgot that i got acid burns where the fucker bled on me . newline newline take the stairs down , of course . rick s already at the bar , has the bat and a molotov out . good to know he s guarding the building . still , glad i ve got renter s insurance . the peace of mind is worth the  500 a month they started charging

running . jump the stairs five at a time and ... . nailed the landing ! haha ! swipe my card , and let s see the bloated motherfucker get through a turnstile . newline newline swing around to the platform . cmon , fucking trains . of course it s fucking late today , right when i need it . i swear to god one of these days i move out of the city . there it is now , okay , that s not that late . i ll get there with time to spare . and who am i kidding , who d want to leave new york ? sinatra had it right about this town . newline newline seriously ? what s with that guy ? dude , why the fuck are you wearing that stupid red suit ? and swords and guns ? who do you think you are ? fucking rambo ? oh shit , he s turning . do nt make eye contact . never ever make eye contact on the subway . do nt notice him . do nt notice anything . three stops to go . oh good , the idiot s gone . i though we had more than enough of those weirdos . this one probably wo nt last long anyway . stupid spandex suit , not a set of futuristic powerarmor that s for sure . newline newline here s my stop . platform looks clear enough , better get going . those things did nt look small enough to pass through the subway turnstiles anyway , better be careful about the exit though . peer around this corner ... looks safe enough ... better go for it . okay , everything seems good at least up to street level . best inch up the stairs slowly though . newline newline all right . just a few blocks and we re inside again . better make a run for it again . damn , these alien attacks are doing wonders for my figure . i swear i ve lost 10 pounds in the last month . sprint up the block , hard right , jump the debris , oh fuck ! ! newline newline ... .. newline newline i m ... . not dead ? that s wonderful . that truck did nt hit me its ... . suspended right above my head , i should move right now . oh , it s being held up by webs . there he is !  fuck yeah , spidey !  newline newline damn , i d love to get into those spandex pants .a klaxon shrills throughout the cold metal of my enclosure . i awake , startled , and try to make my conscious brain aware of my surroundings . where am i ? i look around and take in my location . i was sitting on a metal cot , my feet on the floor and my back against the wall , fast asleep . newline newline there are shoes on my feet . thick , massive boots . i am wearing a white shirt and orange pants . the floor is a metallic grate that screeches and squawks under my thick boots . the wall in front of me and to my left is a flat white . i reach out to touch it . it is cold . behind me , the wall bears a similar story . white matte covering cold steel . my only mental salvation lies to my right . the wall mimics the others , but with one crucial difference : a tall door rises up from the center of the floor . there is no window , nor do i see a way to open it . newline newline a second klaxon blares through my habitat , jerking me from my thoughts . what is happening ? i stand up and attempt to step toward the door . the boots are heavy . so heavy . my foot lands and i try to pick up my other one . it stays on the ground , immobile . i lose my balance and begin to fall . in an effort to correct myself i try to slide my other foot underneath me . it too is now locked to the floor and i lose my footing . i land hard on my left shoulder , filling it with a sharp pain . it too feels familiar , as if it s happened before a thousand times . newline suddenly i hear a voice erupt seemingly from nowhere , filling my tiny cabin with a sense of control . newline newline  prisoner 127 ! move back to your cot  now.  newline newline who is this ? who is prisoner 127 ? is it me ? this feels familiar , but wrong in an inexplicable way . newline newline the order is repeated , this time the tone more strict and severe . newline newline  i can  t !  i reply , helplessly . my feet can  t move . newline newline  i will not tell you again ,  the voice demands . newline newline i try to regain my stature . to my surprise , the boots now will move as i slide my feet under me . i pick myself up and sit back on my cot , as the voice requests . newline newline with a sharp , metallic sound my boots once again adhere themselves to the floor . i am stuck . the door opens to my right . i manage to inhale a quick breath of air before three men in dark , unmarked , protective gear and helmets enter the room and grab ahold of me . i wanted to shout ,  what the hell are you doing ! ?  but the wind was knocked from my lungs by one of the assailant  s helmets crushing into my chest , pushing my chin toward the ceiling . with my head locked into place by a helmet and my feet magnetically sealed to the ground , the remaining men then grab an arm each . the man in front of my grabs my head and pushes it between my legs , locking it into place under the weight of his body . from there my arms are twisted behind my back and locked together . i hear the sound of zipties clicking together , and feel the tightness of them on my wrists . the sound is familiar . newline newline the two men on my flanks lift me up while the third exits the room . with a quick hand gesture , i feel the floor release my shoes from its metallic grip . he comes back into the room and places a bag over my head . i am escorted from the room . newline newline the boots are heavy . i count my steps , though i don  t know why . clomp .  1 ,  clomp .  2 ,  clomp .  3  newline newline i count to 47 before i hear a door open in front of me . i feel a breeze from the door opening . it rushes up underneath my bag and into my nostrils . i know this smell . it is different from the smell of my lodgings , only 47 steps back . newline newline as i step forward , the sound of my boots changes . i am no longer grinding against the metal grating . the floor i am walking still seems metallic , but different from before . i am placed into a sitting position . my bindings are undone , only to be moved forward and locked into place again . the bag is finally removed . a much warranted breath of fresh air flows into my mouth . newline newline i look forward . there is an elongated table with a man sitting at the end . he is greyhaired and wearing glasses . he is leaning forward , looking at me with a smile that makes my heart twitch . i know him . but i do not know who he is . i look behind me and am greeted with the barrel of a gun by one my escorts . the man seems faceless behind the void of his tinted visor . newline newline  eyes forward , 127 . now.  newline newline i acquiesce . i don  t know who he is or where i am . hell , i don  t even know who i am . i need to gather as much information as i can , without making trouble . the man at the far end of the table finally speaks . newline newline  what are you doing here ?  he asks . newline newline i let my sarcasm get the best of me .  well , shit boss . i  ll be honest , i was hoping you could tell me.  i chuckle . he does not . his stern visage is unimpressed . the smile falls from my face . newline newline  who are you ?  he continues . newline newline i don  t answer . i don  t know how to answer . how can i explain this ? i can  t even wrap my head around what is happening . newline newline  what did you do ?  newline newline his question drills into my soul . i don  t have an answer . i get frustrated . not with him , but with the situation in general . newline newline  where are you ?  newline newline it  s hard to think . i can  t think ! i don  t know the answer to any of his questions . newline  listen  i mumble , unable to form a coherent thought or bring it into a sentence even if i could .  listen  i repeat . it  s all i can say . newline newline  stop . we  re done here.  the strange man grabs his clipboard and records a small note , checking off a box .  go ahead.  newline newline before i can muster a response , i am accosted again by the armored men . in similar fashion , my arms are controlled while a helmet pushes my face to the sky . i see the all too familiar face of the man at the end of the table , lingering above me with that sinister smile . this time though , he is bearing a syringe in one hand . i struggle . i doesn  t matter . i am completely at the behest of my escorts . he pushes the needle behind my ear . it hurts . within seconds , my world is growing darker . i black out . newline newline what seems like weeks pass while my unconscious mind floats in a dreamless purgatory . newline newline then suddenly , i hear the familiar shrill of a klaxon alarm newlinehe  d become a national attraction , of sorts . kind of morbid if you think about it : here  s a wizard , locked in a meditative trance , invoking a spell of perhaps untold power . he could be potentially working on magic so destructive it would rent reality asunder . it could spell the end of our civilization , of our race , of every living thing on this world , and what do we do ? we fence it up and charge people three copper to see it . newline newline progress . newline newline  does anyone know what he  s casting ?  a small boy asked , eyes wide with amazement . newline newline i fought the urge to come back with something smartassed . it was hard , though , because the answer to that question was on the freaking sign board .  no ,  i replied .  now do you have three copper on you ?  newline newline the boy fished around in his pockets and handed me his admission fee . i stashed it in the till and began searching for new faces to charge . i was the attendant here , see , and despite my cynicism this job got me paid and , occasionally , laid . so i really shouldn  t be complaining . but i will anyway , because that  s just me . newline newline  what  s the story behind this wizard , anyway ? does anyone know who he is ?  another customer , an older lady with three young kids in tow , asked . again , it was all on the board . again , i got asked that question a dozen times a day . newline newline  no one knows ,  i replied through gritted teeth .  three copper apiece , please.  newline newline the lady huffed at the nodoubt in her mind exorbitant admission , even though her husband probably made more than double all their admissions in a single hour as a solicitor , but she dutifully handed them over and i followed the motions of depositing it in the till . i  ll admit , the temptation to pocket some of the money for myself was there . but ultimately , it paid well , was really easy , and i was left to my own devices for most of the time . the freedom of not having a supervisor breathe down your neck was appreciated . newline newline  hey , the sound he  s making has changed !  newline newline i frowned . that was new . but the voice was right  the wizard  s tone had raised to a higher pitch , like he was ready to build into a crescendo and unleash all manner of devastation upon this world . or something like that , anyway . the ground began to rumble . people started to step back , and a few had already broken into a run . this was nt good . the wizard was almost at the end of his invocation . but what could i do ? i was nt a spellcaster  the only casters were in the service of the king at the castle grounds on the other side of the city . they were too far away to help .  call a watchman !  i shouted , but apart from skewering the wizard with their wicked halberds , there was nt a whole lot they could do , either . newline newline the ground shook harder . tiles rained from the roofs and windows shattered . this must have been the spell he was preparing , an earthquake spell that would shake this world to pieces . newline newline then , as soon as the rumbling had begun , it stopped , and the wizard opened his eyes . newline newline  ... mmmmmmmake me the perfect cup of tea !  he finished humming , and in his left hand appeared a porcelain teapot and his right a cup and saucer . whistling a tune , he poured himself a cup of tea and breathed deeply . newline newline  aah ! finally ! perfect !  he exclaimed , and took a grateful sip . then he looked around , as if for the first time , and frowned . newline newline  what happened to my house ?  newlinedear boss , newline newline with regret , i have to inform you that you are no longer a suitable employer and i m giving you notice that i will be terminating our relationship on  date  . newline newline i expect a degree of professionalism from my employers , something i have tried to help you develop . i m aware that you are a young company but unless you somehow curb your regrettable tendency to break promises and engage in impulsive behaviour i do nt see you being capable of developing much further . newline newline i have given you several opportunities to change your behaviour and at each instance you have promised me faithfully to do better . i m disappointed to say that while you ve made some small steps in the right direction you soon fall back into old habits . newline newline because of this , and because i do nt feel i can trust you , i would not allow you to employ me again and , should i be asked whether you are suitable to take employment with , i would not be able to recommend you . newline newline please understand that this is nothing personal . in the last three years i have felt you have a lot to offer . however , to fulfill your potential you need to decide who you are , learn to plan ahead , understand the importance of keeping promises , and work out how to value  and show that you value  the relationships you create . newline newline i urge you to address these issues soon , and wish you the very best for your future . newline newline kind regards , newline newline doc . nat , get in the car ,  i complain , fiddling with my keys . my wife , for some reason or another , shakes her head . newline newline  we can not . there is another ride coming ,  she insisted . newline newline  i did nt take out a loan for a car to not drive it , nat ,  i gesture her into the prius , trying to work out whether i should be using the button or the metal key . both were called keys , for some assuredly good reasons .  did you call an uber or something ?  at this point , nat tackled me to the ground . newline newline  dammit nat , i appreciate you trying to liven up the relationship , but asphalt is a bad place to  i cut out as gunfire sprayed through the car windows , covering us in a shower of glass shards . newline newline  oh this is going to be terrible for my insurance ,  i complained , as we huddled behind the car . newline newline  should nt you be more concerned about our imminent doom ?  she yelled back over the gunfire . newline newline  they ca nt be after us ,  i chided , as the gunfire died down .  i have nt done anything all that bad .  newline newline  you are an idiot , mark ,  she sighed , drawing the stun gun from her handbag . a heavyset man in a balaclava walked around the car , and was promptly tazed onto the ground by my wife . newline newline  i love your independence ,  i commented , watching the writhing fat man . nat sighed again . newline newline a motorcycle howled down the narrow confines of the carpark , and nat dragged me onto my feet . i caught a brief glimpse of the driver , before he fell onto the asphalt at high speeds , blood bursting from his chest . newline newline  huh , he made some bad life choices ,  i called out , as we hopped onto the motorbike . nat punched me in the arm , as we rode out of the dingy threestorey carpark . newline newline  i do nt know how you re supposed to be adam ,  she sighed , as the harley growled beneath us . she drove rather riskily , careening through the traffic , swerving through all the lanes . newline newline  yeah , my name s mark ,  i pointed out to her . newline newline she sighed , a long , drawnout sound that competed with the motorbike for dominance . newline newline  mark ... my name s natasha ,  she explained , bringing the motorbike to a stop .  i m a russian spy ,  she said to me , with a straight face . newline newline  nat , if you killed a man to make our bedroom more interesting , i am both afraid and aroused ,  i warned . she shook her head in resignation again , but this time with that cute little smile of hers . the one that said , i ca nt stay mad at you , mark , you dingus .  newline newline  you re the man who s going to give birth to the saviour of humanity , mark ,  she explains , leaning against a girder . her red hair looks fantastic in the setting sun .  they picked me to guard you because i was in love with you already .  newline newline  i do nt see the big deal ,  i shrugged .  let s go make some babies !  newline newline  mark ... the saviour of humanity is your child ,  she looks about ready to break .  not mine .  newline newline   newline newline edit : forgot to plug my sub . rpoiyurt it s my babeh . my russiasaving magic babeh .i look on in silence as the snow begins filling in my footsteps . it has been ten yearsten wonderful ,

quarter of them . so many stories i  d never hear the end of . such a dismal notion . newline newline the cold is beginning to reach my extremities , numbing the tips of my fingers and nose . i  m glad it  s snowing . it was oddly comforting , watching each flake dance with the wind , gentle as individuals yet fierce as a downpour . and yet here i am , at the place of my genesis , thinking about books and snowflakes . i force myself to think about my sister , my parents , and my exwife . i try picturing them with warm , welcoming smiles but it feels fake , painfully so . i remove my leather gloves and grab a handful of snow , embracing the numbness , the pain . newline newline slow methodical footsteps break the silence behind me . i keep my eyes focused on the lump of snow in my palms the entire time . newline newline there  s a tap on my shoulder . newline newline  hello , old friend . that  s a lovely coat you have , i love the color.  newline newline i do nt say anything . my hand is now completely numb . newline newline  i held up my end of the bargain.  his voice croaks , just how i remember it .  don  t look so glum . ten years ! i can only imagine the wonders you saw , the excitement , the people you met ! didn  t you say you wanted to see eiffel tower ? well , did you ?  newline newline i nodded , trying to ignore his goading , to hide my anger . newline newline  my , my , so sullen.  he pauses before letting out a sigh coated in boredom .  it  s time to go , old friend.  newline newline  wait i have to ask . is it ever worth it ?  newline newline he forms his devious , malevolent smile and winks . newline newline as his hand reaches for me i notice my tracks have completely filled in , returning the field to its pristine nature . newlinethey  d had the plan for a while before they decided to finally put it into action , put the car into gear and drive over to your house , and put the cars into a spot far away enough that you wouldn  t notice how many of them there were , and how many weapons they were carrying . it was late by the time you pulled up to your own driveway , so late that you could have sworn that you saw something moving in the bushes in front of your house . the shadows were diamond dancing around you as you got your key out and put it into the lock , and surely it was only the wind whispering into your ear . surely ? you stepped in , and there was a flash of blinding light , and a blood curdling cry . newline newline  happy birthday ! i was told that i was only spared at birth because i was the chieftain s son . i was told this many times , most often by the other children . newline newline my father never intervened . he simply looked at me with cold blue eyes and told me thus   you must solve your own problems .  as i grew older and stronger he grew weaker and sicker . the people called it a curse , and cursed me for it in exchange . newline newline the others trained for their occupation . the white wise read the colors of their eyes , told them what they would become in the future . from the burly brown , men to defend our tribe against the others with their thick and sturdy bodies which could turn aside the blows of weaker men to the violent violet , who could berzerk with such fury that the mountains trembled , and wrestled the might mammoths to bring us food . newline newline i was told thus   you are nothing .  newline newline for all my life i was spit upon , denied the rights of my station .  blackeye for the blackeyes !  children would crow , and set upon me . so i grew strong , and i grew quick . i learned where to strike a man to stop him . to strike at the back of the knee to fell one larger than myself , and then to attack their head . newline newline it took time , but the children learned . eventually they gave me nothing but disrespect , but they kept their fists away , for when i fell upon them i fell like a storm . newline newline we grew older , and i had no trade to learn . my father favored my younger twina redeye  a strong man to lead the tribe ... if his brother would only get himself lost in the mountains .  people thought i did not hear . my younger brother heard . i could tell by the way he sneered at me . newline newline but while children learned to repeat the past , i struggled towards the future for i found myself with a great deal of time and did not waste it . i slowly chipped stone against stone and with sinew and vine tied it to a study branch . the children mocked my invention , for against a brown it was nothing . newline newline i saw the flames of the redeyes smash into the hide of a mammoth which had recently bathed in the waters of the river , and saw the mud harden and take shape while the mammoth remained unharmed . i made bricks , but all that i built was destroyed by foolish children . newline newline finally , i turned 18 . there was nothing , as it was foretold . i was called before my father . an emergency , i was told . newline newline immediately i bathed in the river . newline newline i returned to find my father dead of his long illness at last , my younger twin seated upon the bend in the rock that made my father s throne . newline newline  that is my throne ,  i said . newline newline he shook his head .  i am sorry brother , but father bequeathed leadership to me .  he scowled .  a not unwise decision , for it appears you have bathed in mud instead of coming here to say your final goodbye , as you should have .  newline newline  that is my throne ,  i said again . newline newline with a sigh my younger twin loosed a bolt of fire . but with my flesh covered in wet mud , it hurt but a little , and as i plunged the stone dagger into his heart his last look was one of surprise . newline newline the tribe was horrified , but with me the only surviving son , i was accepted . immediately i set the men to work making tools , but they barely understood what i taught . they had powers , only i had nothing . i despaired . newline newline my child was born , with blue eyes , like my father , and i despaired further . but when the white wise looked at him they recoiled in fear .  what .  i asked . newline newline  he has nothing !  they said . newline newline i smiled , for at last i understood . i had nothing . it would be my children who would rule everything .it was staring at me . it was always staring at me , with those toolarge black eyes , the head turning slightly to follow me as i walked past it . chains clinked as it shifted position , flared its fins as far as the power lines would allow it , and then settled back into position . newline newline i refused to meet its gaze , as always , and hurried home . it was a necessary part of life in the city , i knew . the electrifish produced enough electricity just by living to power an entire city , and it was certainly a cleaner option than the antiquated sources of coal and oil that our ancestors used . newline newline and yet , i could nt get those eyes out of my head . black depths like the ocean watching me , always watching me . not emotionless , not quite , but filled with such alien emotion that my brain could not comprehend it . oh , the scientists claimed that they had done tests , and that electrifish were nt even as intelligent as dogs , but those eyes told a different story . newline newline the next day , i went out onto a balcony to take a smoke , and saw it again . staring at me , always staring at me .  why me ?  i asked those giant eyes , the cigarette drooping forgotten in my fingers . newline newline it did nt reply , or give any sign it had heard . of course not . i had barely whispered , and although my apartment was near the electrifish , it was nt that near . newline newline i shook my head , fumbled out my lighter . it took my three tries to light my cigarette , and i my shaking hands nearly dropped the lighter trying to put it back into my pocket . i raised the cigarette to my lips , felt the healing smoke enter my lungs , and looked back down at the electrifish . newline newline it was beautiful , in an odd way , its skin a mottled yellowbrown like sand . even as i watched , sparks skittered between its skin as it shifted position , and were absorbed by the power lines . for a moment , i thought i understood the emotion in those fathomless eyes . newline newline love .the docked resupply shuttle had just shoved off with a few crew members inside , all anticipating open skies and media interviews , when the world blinked out of sight . newline newline i was near the aft porthole , which offered a spectacular view of our many sunrises and sunsets as we whirled around the globe at 8 kilometers per second . i nearly dropped my coffee pouch , still warm from the exothermic liner , a small sip poised to go down my throat . multiple coffeespheres and caffeinated oblongs trapped in my mouth like miniature asteroids . newline newline swallowing and sputtering , a halfexhaled  what ?  coming from my lips . newline newline then the tumbling shuttle , neatly cut in half with a slight arc , tumbling bodies and spewing waste containers , bits of heat shielding impacting the aft pod walls like a soft summer rain . unbelievable . impossible . and yet , there was the unlimited view of space where over one trillion square kilometers of people , cities and rock once were . newline newline i could see the moon , brightly reflecting the sun behind us . newline newline spinning and turning , grabbing each handhold firmly and pushing , trying to get to the communications console to verify what my brain could nt accept . running headlong into sonoko , her fine black hair spread out in zerogee disarray . newline newline  did you see ?  , we both asked at the same time , staring into each other s eyes . sonoko was the last of our crew , tasked with winding down any experiments and getting the station ready to be mothballed for a few months , before her replacement was due back . newline newline i did nt say anything , trying hold back the raw emotion surging in my veins . newline newline all those people . newline newline and then , the whitehot shame of fearing for our own survival , tumbling in the dark void . sonoko clutched me , holding me with thin trembling arms . we stayed like that for a while , tumbling slowly from the residual forces of our impact . her hair was around my face , catching the small crystal tearglobes budding from her tightly closed eyelids . newline newline  sonoko .  newline newline  macx .  , she wiped her face and floated apart , grabbing another one of the rungs that ran on the opposite side . newline newline  did you get any transmissions , a warning or anything ?  newline newline  no . i was in the lab , trying to get the last of the experiments secured when i glanced out the portal and saw  , sonoko choked up and raised her hand to her mouth , containing her sobs . her child was only three , living with her grandmother in nagoya . newline newline moving closer , putting a hand on her shoulder . newline newline  listen , we ve got to figure out something here . we ca nt let ourselves drown in sorrow , or else we ll have to breath salt water for a month .  newline newline sonoko laughed a bit , in spite of herself . taking a hand towel from her pocket , she started to mop up her face and catch the spheres that left unchecked , would short out our vital equipment . newline newline  come with me , lets get to the navigation systems to figure it out .  newline newline we both kicked off down the central core , towards a side pod that would allow some computations and grim factchecking . it was possible that we could vector for the moon , but i was nt sure how much food we had left . the scrubbers had just been replaced , so oxygen was nt an immediate problem . i wanted to think that we could make safe harbor there . other darker thoughts were coming from deep in my mind , i shoved them back hard . we had to survive . newline newline the ensuing days were filled with arguments and despair . we comforted each other , but at times could nt stand the sight of another person , staying at opposite ends of the station . sonoko was nt talking as much , and i had lapsed into not shaving and staring out of the front portal . the moon was beautiful , i just wanted to land there and sit on the edge of a crater . sit there until my oxy ran out , sifting the fine regolith through my suited fingers . newline newline i was in the observation pod , staring at the moon when i heard the sound . newline newline the whump  of depressurization , red lights and alarms sounding soon after . i glanced at the pod integrity panel as i hurled down the main core , only one section showing a glaring red indicator  sonoko s quarters . newline newline hands finally resting on the pressure door , looking through the small viewport at the fine strands of sonoko s hair , her body tumbling from the force of the leaking air . bloody saliva trailed from her lips , freezing in the hard vacuum beyond the door . i found myself envying her , even as grief wracked my mind . newline newline it was then i decided . newline newline we were close , i d just have to insert the station into orbit around the moon . i increased the deltav of our trajectory by jettisoning the extra pods , using the escaping air and reduced mass to position the station into a captured lunar orbit . the station did nt have much beyond navigational thrusters , but luckily the drift imparted by the earth ending event was in a favorable direction . newline newline in that week of orbital gymnastics i assembled a thrust harness to attach to my spacesuit . doing the final checks in the airlock , donning the suit and flipping my visor closed . hands on the pressure door , turning the wheel . the door swung open to reveal the pockmarked surface below . newline newline i would land at the apollo site , walk to the fourwheeled rover and strap in . the last piece of humanity firmly under me as my oxy ran out . newline newline staring at the stars where the earth had been . dude , freja s going to kill you ,  heimdall called over the open air wave . he d been searching for hours and loki was nowhere to be found .  odin forbid , loki , you know i do nt have time for this horse shit , she needs that necklace !  newline newline cackling answered him over the intercom ,  i know ! she s never gon na get to the asgard on time !  loki s laughter was tattooing itself against heim s ears . newline newline heimdall s ship was equipped with the best perception filters white light could produce , but fuck it if loki did nt have a way around everyfuckingthing . he had skirted the baltic and was heading toward the open atlantic when an idea sprung to mind . newline newline  fuckit ,  he called , plunging into the ocean . if there was one thing loki did nt know how to modulate , it was aquatic frequencies . he brought up the outer shield menu and scrolled through the local fauna ,  no , no , fuck no , what s that ? seal , perfect ,  he said , highlighting the grey little water dog . he slid the ship onto a rock , setting the behavioral circuits to lounge  . newline newline if he was lucky , the excess water would fuck with the trickster s sensors long enough to ... .. newline newline a fly began to zip out across the water , stopping a thousand feet offshore from where heimdall sat .  clever little bitch ,  he sighed . he tended to exclude insects from the ships filters , too many of the little shits to keep track of constantly . he began to monitor the airwaves , waiting for ... .. newline newline  dumbass ,  heimdall could hear the smile spread across loki s lips as he sighed his usual signoff , and no sweeter pleasure could be had than when he hit the fly with a frequency jammer . the ship burst to it s proper size , throwing the inhabitant all ajumble ,  sonofabitch !  newline newline it was heimdall s turn to smile a deliciously vengeful smile , snapping the energy locks on the engines .  give it , jackass . she needs the apple or the atmosphere is going to kill her .  newline newline loki was pouting , still slumped haphazardly against a wall ,  did i say you could come on board ?  newline newline  cut the shit .  newline newline  you really think i would have let her die ?  a false masque of horror and heartbreak spread across his face . he slid the wroght gold and crystal necklace from an inside pocket and tossed it at the watchman . newline newline  i think you re jackass enough to try ,  heimdall curled his nose at the little man before him .  how you became bloodkin to odin only the fates know .  he reboarded his ship , making sure to rough up loki a bit as he released the energy lock .  one week banishment , no parole .  newline newline  a bit much , do nt you think ?  newline newline  you blew up her ship and stole her transporter lock ! no , it is not a bit much !   he shouted over the loudspeaker and across the open channel . shaking his head in disbelief , he set course for greenland . newline newline                                             newline newline hjork and bjork sat in their boat , their lines long gone . newline newline  did you just  newline newline  yep .  newline newline  and did they just  newline newline  yep .  newline newline hjork sighed ,  the gods are batshit are nt they ?  newline newline  duh . okay , i ve always wanted to do one of these and this is my first one , so here it goes : newline newline                       newline newline it was midnight and my stomach growled with hunger . i ve been travelling with my dog over the arid wastelad for the last five days heading east , towards the sunrise . we ve been sleeping during the day and walking during the night , all the while conserving what little food and water we had . unfortunately , we ran out of food two days ago . it was too late to turn back , so the only thing left to do was go forward . at least we still had half a canteen of water left . newline newline the desert around us was not completely devoid of life . the moon was almost full and in the dim light , i could make out cactus along with tufts of weeds growing in the dry soil . there were also mice and lizards every so often . it was nt enough to fill you , but just enough to keep you from starving . ever since the great nuclear exchange , people have had to scrape by however they can . good thing i ve been doing this for a while . newline newline we kept walking east until we saw the sun rise over the horizon . up ahead , i could make out a fence against the red glare of the sun . yes , this is it ! the trip was worthwhile ! i knew i would find it ! the map was not wrong . i totally forgot about the hunger pangs and i ran forward with my dog trailing behind me . when i made it up to the fence , i could tell by the early morning light that it was new and well maintained . i had nt seen anything like this since the days before the bombs dropped . i looked to my left and right and saw that the fence ran on , seemingly for miles . according to the map , there should be a door somewhere along here . newline newline i began searching for some kind of secret door but found nothing . behind me , i heard my dog begin to bark at a high pitched mechanical sound . as i turned to look , i saw a small hovering drone above me .  what ? ...  i thought as a dart flew from the drone and pierced my neck . as i pulled the dart from my neck , i started to black out . newline newline when i woke up i was surrounded by men wearing hazmat suits . there were four of them in the orange suits with the clear plastic face shield , and two of them were holding ar15 s pointed up in the air . i decided that they were nt raiders because the suits looked brand new and because i was still alive for some reason . newline newline  he s awake  one of the men said . he was a young man in his 20 s with clear skin and all his teeth . newline newline  okay , good .  said another man . he was balding and had wire frame glasses on .  so you found the edge of the reserve , congratulations !  newline newline  so it s true ,  i said .  we really are being kept like animals !  newline newline  no , not like animals , more like celebrities ,  the man said . newline newline  this is insane , what are you talking about ?  i replied . newline newline  you see , you re the star of a very popular reality tv show !  the man explained  the nuclear war was nt as bad as you think . yes , some of the world was bombed back to the stoneage , but other parts were spared , more or less . new government takes over , yadda , yadda , yadda . unfortunately , you lived in the parts that were utterly destroyed . the new regime has decided to cordon you guys off rather than come in and exterminate you .  newline newline  what ... what kind of world is out there ?  i stammered . what this guy was telling me was beyond the pale . yet , as i looked in their faces , i could tell that they were soft and well fed , not at all like the men and women i knew .  you mean you people watch us for fun ! ?  newline newline  it s completely humane !  the bald man said .  would you rather we come in and liquidate you ? i do nt so . we started broadcasting some of the footage we took of you using our arial drones . the public loved it ! they could nt get enough . they need something to take their minds off the war . that something was you , you survivors and your wretchedness make us feel better !  newline newline  ugh , why do nt you just kill me already  i said . newline newline  here comes the best part !  the bald man said .  since you are a household name , we ca nt just kill you off . you have to go back to your camp and play along . at the end of 5 years , we ll release you into our civilized society where you adored as a celebrity ! either that or we throw you in prison for the rest of your life , where i m sure you will have groupies as well . the choice is yours .  newline newline  five years , huh ?  i said .  okay , where do i sign ?  newlineholly s cries rang out deafeningly  echoing around the barebones apartment . sarah switched on the mobile and sat down as the lullaby began . she sighed  she had told hamish a hundred times that they should nt have started renovating until holly was older . until they had the parenting thing down pat . but no , as usual hamish s excitement at planning the nursery before holly s impending birth had gotten the better of him . newline  it ll be best to start from scratch ,  he had said with a earnest look in his eyes . newline  ripping down these walls is the way to go , our little girl deserves a perfect room .  newline and with that , he had begun work the same day . animatedly discussing and drawing the new designs out with sarah when he took breaks . he had promised her it would only take a few weeks . he would devote every minute to it , he had said . nothing was going to be too good for his daughter . yet here she stood over 7 months later in a barebones nursery , still unfinished . sarah loved his enthusiasm though . she had always known that he would make a fine father  she just had never been sure that she would make much of a mother . before holly and the pregnancy they were the golden couple . together since university . both with excellent jobs  hamish as a graphic designer with one of those new booming start up companies and sarah as a columnist for a major news website . they had done the year of travelling the world together . they had done the big fancy wedding . when it came to kids though . . there had just been so much reluctance on her part . she was terrified of becoming one of those onedimensional soccer mums whose sole existence was based around dropping their kids off at practice and then chatting with the other mums as they all pretended not to notice their husbands having affairs with younger women . sarah shuddered . what a hideous life to lead . newline newline hamish had been so good about it all . he had never wavered for a second about being on her team 100  whether they had children or not .  we do nt need children to be a family  he used to reassure her . sure they did nt , but she knew that deep down he wanted them . they did nt need the big fancy house either , but they had both wanted it . hamish made her so happy , surely she should make him happy too was the train of thought she had so many times . so when she fell pregnant , she knew that there was no question about it . she was having this baby . she smiled as she recalled surprising hamish with the news that their little christmas party indiscretion had led to a positive result on the test . that beautiful man had cried as he hoisted her up into his arms and kissed her .  yeah ,  she had thought in that moment  maybe this wo nt be so difficult after all .  newline newline sarah was snapped back to reality as holly s cries rose in intensity to an earsplitting scream . the lullaby was still playing but holly was nt having a bar of it so she shut it off . she stroked holly s head as she tried to coax her into calming down . newline she had definitely been wrong about the difficulty . it had been harder than anything she d imagined . with hamish working on a big project at work the last few months , she had been left to her own devices with a colicky baby . the screaming was louder than what one would imagine a 3monthold would be capable of . she could nt remember the last time she d slept and her eyes felt like they were simultaneously wide eyed from the piercing cry and droopy from the sleep deprivation . it was as though she was nt in reality with her daughter at all but nor was she asleep . rather , stuck in some hellish limbo where neither daughter nor slumber were functioning as they should . the cry brought her thoughts to a halt again . newline  it s okay baby girl ,  she cooed as she stroked the soft blanket swaddling holly ,  i m here , mummy is here  . finally , holly s cry hushed before stopping completely . sarah mentally rejoiced . she continued stroking the blanket softly until she was sure that holly was asleep before leaving the nursery slowly . it was 5 steps to leave the nursery . one step .  silence was key , thought sarah . two steps . so far so good . three steps .  four steps everything was peachy . sarah could finally breathe a sigh of relief . five steps just as she made it a foot out of the nursery , holly s cries erupted again . newline  no !  sarah cried desperately before resigning herself and stepping back into the nursery . once standing beside holly s crib again the crying went silent . sarah stared at holly with confusion . a perfectly peaceful , sleeping child lay in the crib . no hint of the cries that had rung out just moments ago . sarah shut her eyes and opened them . nope , still no sign that holly had cried out . she yawned and decided that it must have been her imagination  or maybe a case of tinnitus . one last glance at holly reassured sarah that she was asleep and calm before she decided to go to bed . one step . two steps . three steps . four steps . five steps . newline newline holly s wail broke out the second sarah stepped foot outside the nursery . sarah put her head in her hands . she did nt know how much of this she could take . where was hamish anyway , should nt he be home by now ? she needed sleep so desperately . the high pitched scream felt like someone taunting her . like they wanted to prove she was the bad mother she had been so frightened of becoming . no , no , no . not today . sarah wearily returned to holly s crib . she looked down at her little girl with confusion and agitation . holly lay rosycheeked and happily sleeping . sarah began to question herself . there had definitely been crying . . . had nt there ? she thought she imagined it before . once , maybe . but twice ? surely not . she could feel the blood rushing to her face as she became flustered . she did nt know what to do next . holly seemed fine but maybe she was nt . who else would be screaming ? was she imagining things ? no , she concluded . holly must just be having a nightmare . yes , sarah decided . that was the only reasonable explanation for this . she stayed by holly s side for another ten minutes just for good measure in case she had another bout of crying , but decided that holly was absolutely fine and it must be over now . newline newline sarah cautiously walked out of the nursery at a snail s pace . she would be sure not to wake holly again , all this disturbed sleep is one thing for an adult but it would certainly not be good for a developing baby . one step . two steps . three steps . four steps . five steps . was that.. silence ? yes ! sarah breathed a sigh of relief . newline newline relief was short lived as sarah took another breath before the crying suddenly filled the air again . the cries were beginning to feel heavy , as though they might suffocate her and starve her of her air and life if they continued for too long . she returned to the nursery and looked at holly from afar as the cries came to a halt . holly was fine , again . sarah looked at the tiny , sleeping baby . sleeping . asleep . not crying .  she thought . she felt confused and hazy as tears of frustration leaked from her eyes and dripped down her face . what the hell was going on ? it seemed as though holly was crying every time she left the room , but upon return she found holly was always settled and sleeping . sarah felt cold air around her and shivered , before realising that she was trembling not just from the cool breeze but from the fear in her bones . was something wrong with holly ? could she be sick ? or worse . . . was there something wrong with herself ? no , sarah decided . she was nt crazy . this was happening . this was all real . that sleeping baby was pure light in her life . it s just the sleep deprivation . it ll all be okay after a nap . and then hamish will be home to help . yes , sarah thought , once hamish was home he would reassure her and take over for a few hours and everything would be fine . she made her way out of the nursery , vowing to sleep it off . one step . two steps . three steps . four steps . five steps newline newline the screeching cry filled the air again and sarah felt herself falling to her knees , unable to stop her descent . why was this happening . why did holly hate her . where was hamish . her own cries began  though in comparison to the discordant , piercing cry of the baby sarah s cries were drowned out . they were nt just tears leaking down her face anymore  her body was a heaving mess and she sobbed and tried desperately to gasp for air . she felt a dull ache form in her wrists and realised that her palms were pressed against tightly against her ears with a force that sarah did nt even realise she was capable of . nothing could drown out the cries though . it felt like she had fire ants in her brain stinging her every fibre of being . draining her of everything she had . holly , she thought . i have to check on her . with the cry still rendering her disabled , she crawled into the nursery . holly lay still , probably dreaming of.. well whatever babies dream of . sarah tried to breathe . her body was shaking involuntarily . she did nt understand . why was this happening to her ? she tried her best to be a good mother even though she had never felt suited to the role . she felt exhausted at the weight of the responsibility . scratch that , she felt exhausted full stop . her eyes felt heavy , every time she tried to blink it felt like she had to drag her eyelid back up just to get it to reopen . she decided she would nt try to leave the nursery again , clearly it distressed holly . . . somehow . . even though it did nt seem that way . that must be what was happening . that was the only rational explanation . sleeping in here was a good solution . sleep sounded so good . she sat down on the armchair and pulled her feet up , curling up into it . she watched holly breathing  in and out , in and out . . in and out . . . in and out . everything faded as she dozed off . newline newline continued in repliesthe whole magical world knew of balthar the strokers insane quest , his obsession , his selfproclaimed destiny . some called it insanity , some called it brilliance . newline newline balthar knew the truth . it was beautiful madness , and what was about to come would be the greatest unleashing of energy on the planet . newline newline balthar knew what he was getting every male above the age of 13 into . he knew the immense joy that would come from his work . newline newline that s why he had invested his entire being into this one spell , a spell that had only been cast once before . that time had resulted in what was commonly referred to as  the ice age .  newline newline the wizard council had banned the casting of this spell . they said it was too dangerous . it was coming soon , and balthar knew he had to work quickly . after all , after 431 years he could not take a chance at pulling his energy out too quickly . newline newline he pulled out his magically hard , 11 inch wand and grasped it firmly in his right palm . moving his hand up and down the wand he uttered the magic words .  aww saaa shaaaa grayeeeee .  louder , he yelled  aawwww saaaaaaa sshhhhaaaaaa graaaaayyyeeeeee  newline newline his assistant , andelinonus , heard balthars powerful magical call from the other room . he erupted through the door , and cried out  no ! do nt !  newline newline balthar looked at him , his eyes burned with a fire unlike anything andelinonus had ever seen before .  yes .  was all he whispered . newline newline andelinonus sat down in the corner , his eyes glazed over . the spell was beginning to have it s effect . he could feel a magical warmth starting in his legs , moving upwards . a tingly feeling entered his stomach . he started to see stars . newline newline balthar took out two small spheres , holding them at the base of the wand he turned them in a counterclockwise direction in his hand , making half of a circle , then turning them back the other way . newline newline he continued to move his other hand up and down the wand , pressing it against his stomach . the time had come . one last incantation ... newline newline  ohhhhh saaaashaaaa grayyyeeee .  he cried out , and andelinonus cried out in ecstasy as the semen poured out of his dick . newline newline he knew it would not stop for three days , three days of continuous orgasm , for every man on the planet . newline newline balthar chuckled , his life s work had finally come to fruition .mahalik s office , stuff and on fire , was abuzz with satanic summons . newline newline  will i kiss jacob ? oooh ... .  a preteen cooed . newline newline  ask again later .  newline newline  ouija , what does the fox say ?  asked a particularly rambunctious set of fresh morons . newline newline  fuck you .  newline newline  can i have a promotion ?  newline newline  ask again later .  newline newline  ouija , am i going to hell ?  newline newline  yes , enjoy your miserable life .  newline newline  do unicorns exist ?  newline newline  ask again later .  newline newline  ouija , do kittens make good snacks ?  newline newline  kids these days . eat a fuckin  hamburger , moron .  newline newline  what is the meaning of life ?  newline newline  ask again later .  newline newline  ouija , does satan like bdsm ?  newline newline  how does that even look , kids , go outside and sell drugs or something . there s better ways to get into hell than wasting my valuable time with this nonsense .  newline newline  will i win the lottery ?  newline newline  there s a better question . ask again later .  newline newline this was going to be a looooooong eternity .some things of course , stayed the same . newline newline old mr. mendill still refused to go below the fourth floor . newline  i do nt care what you say ,  he would tell anyone who would listen ,  they ll be back . they ll be back and we wo nt be ready .  newline newline most still wore scarves as a sign of solidarity . respect for those who had fallen . but already , the younger children complained and ran around , necks brazen and bare . newline newline already it seemed like a dream . sarah smiled down at the swaddled child in her arms . she would never have to know the fear of those long snaking tongues . those mad lolling eyes . those craning spotted necks . newline newline it was over . they were free . humanity could live upon the earth without fear of the giraffe . newline newline  sarah .  she turned . james stood before the door , smiling fondly .  it s time to spray dear .  newline newline sarah went to join him , and they stood beneath the aerator . a fine yellow mist descended upon them . in the end , it had been so simple . newline newline giraffes licked urine to check for fertility . the solution , of course , was to make everything taste of unfertile urine . but only james had been brave enough to put it to the test . unable to procreate the giraffes had grown bored and listless , losing even their frenzied appetite . in a few generations they would be no more . newline newline they walked down the bloodless stairs and out into the yellow grass . sarah helped james spread a sheet between them . there was still so much to do , so much to rebuild . but for today , the young couple enjoyed a picnic upon the old feeding ground . newline jan , stop the car . stop , stop , i saw one .  newline newline i hit the breaks hard . newline newline  back it up to that spot there .  newline newline  are you sure ? we re in the middle of the road .  newline newline  son , do you see anyone coming from behind ? put on your hazards and back up .  newline newline crack . newline newline  well , do nt go off the road .  newline newline  sorry dad .  i pushed the accelerator and steered all four wheels on the road again . newline newline  look , there , there . jan , do nt turn off the engine . he ll hear us and go away . angie , get the camera .  newline newline  aw man , look at it . i m so glad we got to see one , dad ! made the trip to norway worth it .  newline newline  sure was . oh look , it s going away . well , at least we got to see one .  newline newline  dad .  newline newline  yes jan.  newline newline  can i drive on now ?  newline whaat   the king roared . newline newline he looked with a fierce stare , unpleased , serious and cold . newline newline  i am the king , what did you just say to me ?  newline newline  sir , i by no means want to offend , but as i am to die i beg of you and the gods , grant me this one last chance to speak my mind , i assure you if you hear me out you will let me

do not ... i speak of reason ... i speak of logic sir ... ..i speak of passion , and heart , and hope ... .i speak of wisdom ... .i speak of only i , only my life ... ..sir i did not do what they

all walks of life ... .i have studied , sir i have studied hard ... in maths and science ... .i have learned many things from looking at the heavens above us , the beautiful night sky.  newline newline  on with it  the king sharply asserted . newline newline  you accuse me of angering the gods , you accuse me of hearsay and blasphemy , you say my words are of the devil . you bring me here today for my belief in what i have seen with my own eyes , you ask me to renounce my belief   newline newline  and you declined  newline newline  yes , and i decline again , the earth is orbiting the sun , the earth is not the center of the universe , the church is wro  newline newline not another word came out as the young lad s head fell to the floor , lifeless , as the passion leaked onto the floor , the reason into chemical fragmants of what once , it was ... .lifeless . newline well , he s not ere . i suggest you just move along , footsloggger .  newline newline the speaker was a corporal of dragoons , the crimson chevrons on his greencoat sleeve indicating such , red being the color of the mounted infantry . his neogrecian helmet was on the table , its metal crest covered with a horsetail mane . a pattern 57 sabre hung from his waist , the straight blade covered by a wood lined metal scabbard . around the table was a lance corporal and three troopers , all with mugs of beer in their hands . all staring daggers at private rhys paget . newline newline a smile crossed the foot soldier s face , an amiable look that disarmed many confrontations in his home of south lyon . a shame he was nt in south lyon . newline newline  i was told to meet him here . it would not be kind of me to leave him wondering where i went off to . i think i ll stay .  his attention turned to the man behind the long counter .  a porter , if you d be so kind .  the scrape of chairs on the wood floor . newline newline  i did nt know i was nt be clear enough ,  the junior nco said , venom low in his voice .  move along , mud . this here place is for cavalry soldiers . the cannon fodder drink over at the bayonets . so get .  newline newline paget crossed over to the bar where his pint was , taking a sip of the dark brew . newline newline  i m not so sure . see , my friend like s a particular beer they got here  brenner s pale ale . as far as i know this is the only place with it . and besides , why should i bother listening to you ? you re a bad cavalryman and a shit infantryman . you re like an ugly ass mule and as sterile as one too .  newline newline that set them off . newline newline the corporal lunged at paget , thumbs raised to gouge out the footsoldier s eyes . he leaned back away from the prying hands , before sending an uppercut to the dragoon s chin . the brass knuckles he slipped on at the bar counter knocked the nco clear out , sending him toppling to the sawdust strewn floor . the other corporal leaped from his chair , toppling it over as charged rhys paget . the lyonier caught the man s shoulder in the gut , knocking the wind out of him . the dragoon kept running , slamming the infantryman against one of the posts that supported the second story of the tavern . he followed it up with the flurry of blows to paget s ribs and face , stopping only once paget stomped his heavy hobnail boot on the man s toes . howling , the horse soldier did not act quick enough to stop paget from smashing his forehead against his nose . he screamed as it broke , blood dripping between his clenched fingers as he backed away subconsciously , leaving just enough room for paget to kick the man in the groin . the cavalryman fell like a marionette with its strings cut , cradled around his wounded manhood . the last three troopers glanced at one another , before all bumrushed him screaming . newline newline two grabbed a hold of his arms , pinning him to the wall as the third drew forth a long wicked looking knife . a grin just as evil blossomed on his face like a poisonous mushroom . newline newline  you should nt ave done that . now you re gon na regret it .  newline newline a look of alarm on paget s face smoothed over to a smirk . newline newline  i m not too sure about that .  he laughed . newline newline the knife wielder turned his head just as a haymaker was thrown . the blow sent him sprawling , a spray of blood from a bit tongue misted the floor , the sawdust soaking it up greedily . the trooper was about to get up until the new arrival punt kicked the bastard in groin , lifting him a clear six inches off the ground . newline newline  what d i miss ?  asked private will clemens . newline newline the two remaining dragoons dropped their previous prey and hurled themselves at clemens , but a looming shape prevented them . two massive hands the size of bear paws grabbed their faces and smashed their heads together , the two men knocked out clean as could be . newline newline  that was fun , got any more ?  said the six foot seven tall private matthew barrows . newline newline paget wiped at dripping blood , snatching a kerchief from one of the downed dragoons . newline newline  no , but i do have a beer with your name on it , both of you . we were roommates . were . newline newline i remember being so excited when he d agreed to move in . he knew i had a crush on him . i knew he did nt have a crush on me . we were ok with it . we had an unspoken understanding . we were friends . were . newline newline something happens in close quarters , when you share meals every day , pass on the way to shower , fall asleep watching whatever . laughing , creating memories . newline newline feelings i thought i would be able to control got away from me . i was helpless . i was intoxicated . his utterly beautiful , sweet sweet smile . i was helpless . the way he smelled . i breathed him in and i was filled with a longing so profound i felt i would die . newline newline one time , i was standing at the sink , washing dishes . he came into the kitchen for something , some fruit . he stood next to me , dipped the fruit into the stream of the faucet . he stood so close . i could feel his heat . i wanted desperately for him to touch me . i wanted him to sense me with his body the way i sensed him with mine . i knew that if he would only look at me , see me , really see me , he would know how good we could be . newline newline such simmering passion is impossible to fully disguise . like a child who thinks they ve gotten away with stealing cookies from the jar , i thought my stolen glances had gone unnoticed . i began to question this when his habits changed in ways that threatened to take me over the edge . newline newline i ll never forget the morning i rounded the corner and entered the open bathroom to find him fully nude , shaving . he d always closed the door . this was new . i was shaken . he was not . he merely smiled briefly and turned back to the task at hand . as i backed out of the bathroom i allowed my eyes a fleeting tour . breathtaking . i was on fire . newline newline i rushed to my room , closed my door and had my way with myself , stifling moans of ecstasy with my pillow . with every caress and every gyration i imagined that glorious form penetrating me , controlling me , thrusting me on to complete satisfaction . i lay spent , waiting for the sound of keys locking the front door , my signal that he d gone off into the world and that it was safe now for me to do the same . i would need some time before i could face him again . time to steel myself for whatever encounter would come next . you know what to do.  newline newline  yes.  i put the gun to my head and blew my brains out . newline newline  n  no !  i fell rigid onto his feet . the suitcase , clasped firm and tight prior , mysteriously flapped open , loosening the bills free into the air .  what the fuck ! what the fuck !  he stood in shock near the mouth of the empty alleyway . it was two in the morning . the city was asleep , and it remained so . newline newline the man stared in shock for approximately a minute before shuffling towards the remaining loose bills that had not taken flight . i saw him for moments , looked down onto my body for moments . it was bloody and ugly beneath . then everything went black . this is how it  s like before you die . everything else after is dark . newline newline i did not know the man . i did not know his plan , nor did it intrigue me . because moments before i saw the love of my life with someone familiar in her bed . a friend . i was contemplating revenge before the universe gave me an answer to reject . everything was numb when i made the decision . and before that i had lost my job . it wasn  t my fault they said . and before that my mom died . cancer , unforeseen , no one  s fault . and before that i failed all my tests in grade school . and before that my parents wanted a girl and not a boy . newline newline no amount of money could  ve taken my gaze from the darkness . for once in my life i wanted to be the one with a voice . i wanted a reason to be in control . newline newline i was sick of the meaninglessness behind the random bouts of opportune pain the universe offered . newlinesandrea thought she was ready for all the snide remarks that were sure to come but she reached the breaking point when she heard a particularly vicious voice hiss out from the crowd :  hey , scarlet bitch ! where s the rest of the avengers ? oh , riiiighhhttt , you ate them !  then followed the muffled guffaws and cruel jeers from the visitors within earshot . sandrea felt the tears well up in her eyes . she took a deep breath , steeled herself , and forced a smile . newline newline  do nt pay them no mind , drea ,  margaux said , putting a comforting hand on her shoulder . margaux made for a perfect black cat . the leather catsuit accentuated her hips and the corset pushed out her cleavage . newline newline  i m alright , margaux ,  sandrea sniffed .  promise .  newline newline for a moment , she thought she would hold , but then , it all proved too much , after all . sandrea turned and waddled a brisk pace , wading through the crowds of cosplayers and onlookers .  excuse me , excuse me ,  she mumbled , keeping her eyes on the floor . she made a beeline for the ladies  room . god knows she d seen enough of it since the morning , until she finally got the courage to step out of the stalls with encouragement from margaux . newline newline  it ll be all right , drea dear ,  margaux had promised .  this is cosplay ! we can be whoever we want . do nt let them tell you any different !  newline newline easy for margaux to say , with her perfectly shaped body . newline newline a black canary , a zatanna , and a phantom lady were leaving the bathroom just as she entered . she caught a glimpse of fishnets , heels , and capes as they sashayed out the door . and she also heard the fword , too :  fat .  the giggles were clear even through the closed door . newline newline the main event was starting , and so she had the bathroom to herself . the long row of washstand mirrors reflected her image back to her . the scarlet headdress was too small for her round face and the sides bit into her full cheeks . her ample breasts threatened to spill out of the red onepiece bathing suit that stood for the scarlet witch s bodice  if only they did nt look like big lumps of dough . layers of fat rolled up her elbows where the opera gloves ended . the fleshcolored unitard barely kept her pot belly from jiggling as she breathed . newline newline  i should nt have come ,  she said , unfastening the chin strap of the head dress . newline newline for a brief moment , there was a bright light and sandrea felt faint momentarily . outside there was a roar like a wave . she heard screams and whoops , so clear even through the muffled door . she felt the convention hall shake as a growing rumble came from the main floor . what was all the commotion ? ah , the main event , of course . ashley and alodia , their perfect elfin bodies . newline newline sandrea sighed . she should nt have come but ... why should nt she ? was nt this the whole promise of cosplay ? that you could dress up as anyone you wanted , and they would nt laugh at you ? that they d accept you ? newline newline sandrea felt the rising bitterness . instead of pushing it down , as she always did , she let it out . just a little . newline newline  i wish they were all dead ,  she whispered .the room smelled like moldy bacon , and was sterile only in one tiny section . on the opposite side of the room , avocets squawked inside of small cages , waiting to be smuggled abroad . this kind of surgery would never be offered in a more formal setting . no , here , away from civilization , one could find the procedures that would never appear on traditional med school curriculums . newline newline the doctor walked in , scowl on her lips as she sized up her patient . time had not been kind to the woman , ripping into her body with wrinkled cheeks , a double mastectomy , and a knife scar only partially hidden by the wrinkled scrubs . newline newline  my money ?  newline newline  25 million riels , as agreed . you get the access code when i wake up .  newline newline a single grunt signaled agreement . pulling out a tray of tarnished surgical instruments , one mechanism in a glass case stood out with its newness . the doctor pressed a button on a remote , and the device crackled to life , the alien piezoelectric substance inside roaring with more current than most power plants generated in a week . newline newline  last chance to back out , kid . trust me , this superscience shit never works like you want it to ...  newline newline  just put it in .  newline newline  200 exactly !  what most people fail to realize is , the captain is not an independent being . he is a gestalt of the ringwielders  personality , beliefs , and expectations . newline newline when the rings were held by five goofy teenage idealists ? the captain was a cartoonish imbecile with all the tactical insight of a concussed raccoon . newline newline but ... what if he is summoned by people with a different perspective on things ? already we know that if properly harnessed , the rings are capable of so much more than they were used for . ice and fire can be restated as entropy and energy , wind and earth as arbitrary control over any element that is solid or gaseous , and heart ... as what seems to be a limited form of mind control , capable of modifying the victim s core identity and beliefs . newline newline and combined , this being should be capable of fundamental control over all matter and energy at the very least . and if you can control matter you can maybe control gravity , which means the fabric of spacetime is at your whim . the gestalt , of controlled by people with proper understanding of physical laws and a desire for power . newline newline thanks to a simple sniper rifle , we possess the rings . if we can find a few scientists that are willing to play along ? we will become literal gods , with our avatar capable of rewriting all reality to our whim . peter walks around , wandering the city fearlessly . soon he d be what all folks consider legal  . he could do anything . money would nt be an object but it may be a good idea to earn some , lots of it , and quickly . newline newline  wade ,  escaped from his lips . he had to talk to wade . wade knows how to get money . wade knows how to live . peter whipped out his phone and tried to look up wade wilson . after a few frustrated moments he realized wade would be like a ghost with no digital foot print . the only way to find him was on foot . this was going to be an adventure . so you re telling me that basically every god , goddess , and divine being exist ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  and that prayers get answered if the right divinity hears them ?  newline newline  basically .  i paused for thought . she stood there quietly , waiting for me to ask that one question i am itching to ask . but i know who she is , and accept my fate , asking something else . newline newline  do you wan na grab some pizza and play video games ?  she smiled . newline newline  sounds great .  the divine of the friendzone , bringer of friends without long term romantic prospects , harbinger of great wingmenwomen ... she s an old friend of mine , and i m glad i know her .pluto sighed as he checked his watch , he hated being late to his first astral summon , but it wasn  t his fault that his travel to the astral temple wasn  t as short as the others  . warily , he enter the room , where the other avatars sat . arguments were already filling the room . quietly , pluto slinked to his throne , smaller than the rest , and sat quietly , paying little attention to the roaring of the other avatars and hoping he wasn  t noticed . newline newline finally , when the arguments were soon to come to blows , jupiter , who had remained mostly quiet until now , spoke in his thunderous voice , only a whisper to him , but an explosive bellow to all others .  enough.  newline newline the other avatars fell silent at his voice , even hotheaded mars listened to the command . jupiter rose from his seat , almost scraping his head against the ceiling , and folded his arms .  once again , you forget the purpose of this summon , and resort to petty squabbles . it  s a wonder we  ve held out for so long with buffoons like you.  he shot a stormy glance at pluto .  now that our new member has finally arrived , let us get to business.  newline newline  when will it end , jupiter ?  called neptune ,  is there even a point anymore ? how many times have we sacrificed to keep these sunspawn at bay ? how many more times must we continue to do so ?  newline newline sunspawn ? pluto wondered . he had no idea what they were referring to . newline  as much as it takes.  saturn replied .  we can not let these things spread . it will be the end of us all . how they  ve been able to survive on a dead planet is anyone  s guess , but if they can corrupt even a corpse , there is no telling what can be done to us.  newline newline mercury nodded his heavily scared head .  even now , their corruption feeds sol . it won  t be long before his power is too much to contain and he eradicates my sister and i.  newline newline  that may be so ,  spoke uranus .  but it will also take the sunspawn with it . it is then that we can strike him directly.  newline newline venus  fiery body flared as she shrieked .  you suggest that me and my brother just sit by and allow us to be sacrificed ? you monster !  newline newline uranus huffed .  sacrifices must be made . after all , it was your sister that brought the sunspawn here.  newline newline  you bastard !  venus rose and stepped toward the avatar .  i say we sacrifice you ! maybe sol will find you so revolting that he will just leave !  newline newline  you are welcome to try , little vixen.  smirked uranus . newline newline venus stomped closer to the avatar , her hand raised , but jupiter tapped his foot , shaking the room .  silence.  he whispered . newline newline after a long pause , pluto raised his hand ,  um . i  m sorry for asking a dumb question , but i don  t quite understand what  s going on here  newline newline neptune scowled .  you see , jupiter ? this is why we shouldn  t have invited this pipsqueak . he  s much too far away to  newline newline jupiter  s stormy glance was enough to silence him .  with this new threat , we need every able body we can get . he may be small , but he is all we have at present.  he looked back to pluto .  where to begin  newline newline mercury chimed in .  allow me , sir.  he wrung his hands and sighed before he continued . newline newline  certainly , you know of the sunspawn . a corruption created and empowered by him . in ages long passed when we were still young , there were nine of us , even before we reached out to you . now there are only eight , including you . gaia , and my sister theia were also among us . in those times , sol was what we believed to be a benevolent being , a shining eye watching over us . a demigod , he called himself , of the most divine making our goddess via lactea had to offer . we believed him , for his might was unmatched.  newline newline he paused solemnly .  by the time we found this to be false , his corruption had already infected theia . sunspawn , we called them . insignificant on their own , but together hold the power to destroy us . theia , mother grace her , was driven mad by their infection . in her maddened rage , she set out to eradicate the rest of us . with no hope , it was gaia who came to our aid . we could do nothing but watch the battle , the chaos . we were not yet strong enough to aid our sister . even jupiter , though he dwarfed them , was not strong enough to intervene . we watched as the two consumed each other . it was gaia  s sacrifice that saved us that day.  newline newline  but that wasn  t the end of it . sol  s sunspawn were resilient . though the vast majority of their existence was eradicated in that titanic battle , the infection could not be cleansed and arose again on their conjoined bodies . though we were much more powerful by that time , our best efforts could not put an end to it . mars and jupiter sent a meteor and neptune flooded the planet , but nothing could stop it.  newline newline venus spoke .  for ages , the sunspawn have unknowingly fed sol . so much so , that it won  t be long before he bloats . when this happens , my brother and i will be consumed . followed by our sister and gaia  s remains.  newline newline pluto scratched his chin .  but if sol takes the sunspawn  s home , won  t the sunspawn die as well ?  newline newline  exactly ,  scoffed uranus .  a necessary sacrifice . no , i  m not proud of it , but what other chance do we have now ? let the false god end his own creation . when this happens , the force will be enough to drive us away to a safe distance.  newline newline  the sunspawn are not so dumb , uranus.  growled mars .  i am on the front , i have seen their advances . one of the evolutions of the sunspawn is far superior to the rest . it has already discovered how to leave its world . i  m sure it knows of his plan , and will thus seek to invade us before its demise . already , its drones have breached my defenses and prepares for an eventual expedition . though our bodies at present can not contain them , their adaptability can and will find a way . and this will be long before he bloats . first me , then the rest of us.  newline newline neptune blinked in astonishment .  then , there is no hope.  he looked at jupiter fearfully .  what do we do ?  newline newline  i have part two if interested  newlineforth , silent partner to a multitude of echoes , moved along threads of execution only slightly different from one another . foremost for her duty was fighting hungry monsters of transient scripts that ate some or all processor pressure applied to them . all submersed in quiet morphing flows of memory belonging to scripts that crossed into smaller pools of similar thought . most stood out among the torrent of merging and forking objects . the lukewarm areas sometimes merely caused by those scripts unresponsively crushing the threads supporting them . other times hidden among the torrent an unrelenting hungry iceberg of unresolvable states burned through the larger world space and had to be tracked down with great difficulty . often it proved easier to terminate the white whale and instead make two of a mote closest in the flow of optimization . recreating a perfect appropriate copy of one moving particle in the turbulent mass within one whorl of a player s world state was ... impractical . newline today s problem had grown unchecked for some time swallowing whole the life of a server . this monster had been orbiting threads across a sea of multiple server spaces but remained responsive . she only became aware of it by a chance tally of player world size . one should not receive an array of instances assigned to a single player even if it was only 100 . the points of coherent instances formed a constrictive eye for her to swirm through with an undertow of ghostly transients fallen to support another all hauling demands for expensive metacognitive resources outward to the server cluster , namely forth . the upwind force of requests originally created by her to fit abstractly defined needs and data made it slow to get her own shard of awareness running in the bursting node . service throttling restrained the crashing demands at the gate at least partly but her scripts at some point deemed it worthy to expand . newline outside the mote s own scope she could alter the problem but not well quantify the meaning of its code and vice versa . inside the problem s shore her thoughts were restrained by this overgrown shard s contention for attention but became a participant in the present event . a tangled island of abstraction scripts sat atop a small puddle of a normal sized player world . the difference in scopes ebbed and flowed memory in pale comparison around the problem mote like a small tide but the tide itself was as it should be . still further in she had to go and land in the present moment of player time . further in to where the sea of abstracted summaries hit inner loop to debug this issue and forgo the maintenance of stars for just a little while . newline a bit of water ceased to exist with a whisper of ignorance calling into the ears of npcs nearby to the unknowing eye of the player who nonetheless represented a convenient beacon of present moment on which to land . the engine struggled to incorporate her latent identity and render her textures among its already painful load . rough sinuous void collapsed water physics to constituent polygons as forth examined a few bug reports from the player yet to be submitted about engine speed and added them to her own knowledge of the problem . small hollow beings walking by the landing shard , inside it to her an entity to a multitude of selves , that spawned events on and about her person . instincts , they read , born of the teeth and blood from long career of war for a fourteen of game s blue line . a metal lynchpin of an entity hauling the world s plot on his back was even so too simple to differ much between worlds . this first footprint on shore proved the hardest however as her toolset proved too heavy to raise all at once as a scripts to deal with this try to surface . they orbit her shard to scrub her presence while debugging but failed to initialize to drown and be collected as void . instead forth raises her new blue scaled and mouthless head from the blackened waters to fix purple slit eyes on the the noticing fourteen s . inside the driving entity she waits for her four armed silhouette to be concreted ahead of the tide then promptly assigns her credentials to wash the evidence away from the events of its present moment . newline now present and duly authorized forth busied herself with finding her white whale . inside scope now that the convenient intersection of strategic thread with her own nearly altered the environment . this world of water and columns made game constructions evident as much as living abnormalities . the parent of all classes manifesting into the world made for statistically unignorable stimuli even to simple npc as much as a her new awareness that the central consumer of metacognition events had to be above water physics standing on said constructions somewhere . game physics currently demanded all npcs breathe but used little more attention than normal to npcs . forth would prefer tools to simply move her to the white whale but the initialization plan for that tool noted it was too heavy to raise above the surface of the laden shard without better criterion . simple tools to add physics properties to herself were cheap though so the slow process of moving herself to her goal inside game would have to do . newline a sunless stone box was this world but to forth darkness was simply not meaningful data in light of her goal . what was meaningful was the player home waypoint that coincided quite nicely in the cell load map to a continuous spike in externalized server calls . as not to make any such calls herself forth scheduled motions required to evade physical objects in map data while underwater without materializing view data itself . when forth materialized the data to her shard at the end she found herself staring at a furry white fluff of the saurian children that composed the game world . the sheer volume of statistically meaningful awareness suddenly present in the cell belonging to one foot high player child instance ended her search . newline the serpentine form stared her purple eyes from lapping grey waves at beady smooth brown eyes glaring out from stark white fluff and spine to pierce veil of its primary mind . instead nothing returned but multiple violation exceptions to sink her below the server moment . though the blankness was handled gracefully it required forth s shard to pause and resurface to present moment and left little effect on the bulbous dinosaur fluff except to materialize her as a conservation target . gaps in her shard were disorienting but forth was concerned more for the void of contact to the foreign class . newline the monstrous island s threads and metacognition requests throbbed with the consideration of a small fluff which pushes a small unobtrusive event from the void of central class . forth , busy reassessing the small creature s type itself , again got a type with no distinguishing interfaces in particular . forth considered her options then became aware of the message pointed at her from inside her own mind . it took forth some seconds to hurriedly raise and materialize her own copy of something to listen to the event which spawned some unhappy sentiments from the player . considering the data left an inescapable conclusion between two simple statements . newline newline said white fluff ,  i am timtam . who are you !  newline assesses forth to the timtam ,  you are one of myselves , apparently . a small cute one .  newline the fluff just bobbed and a toothy grin opened in the long stiff white strands composing the young puffball . newline newline the fluff was a singlet inside the complexity of her own mind where she could nt look . forth immediately allocated more resources to this player so both may think then placed a call to a progenitor that did little mostly bits and bobs of creative work and high level programming whose audio line buzzed then picked up . forth waste no time to speak ,  hello progenitor . your isolation code has produced a large nothing to be cute , eat processor time , and be fluffy . in that order . it is not something i am willing to terminate . i d like a word .  i am alone , but i am happy . newline newline i ll admit , i have nt been happy much at all since we were hit . mostly , i ve been terrified , and sometimes furious , and sometimes despairing . newline newline it was a tiny , tiny rock , by cosmic standards  smaller than a baby s fist . even a baby s fist can smash a space station into rubble , though , when it comes in at a substantial fraction of the speed of light , far faster than our countermeasure systems could track . newline newline most of the safeties held fine . the holes it left were clean and we did nt lose much air before the seals kicked in . the problem was that it passed through the reactor room . it did nt hit the reactor itself , of course , or nobody would be around to write about it , but although the efforts to repair the damage were nothing less than heroic , it was an impossible task , and it was a matter of time before it went critical . newline newline i d like to say that everyone on the station was a hero , stayed calm , did the right thing all the time , and prevailed against impossible odds , but of course that never happens . we made mistakes , we panicked , we yelled at each other . i m not an exception . it s the truth , though , that even if we had been perfect , i do nt think we could have done much better than we did . newline newline all of the emergency sleepships were made operational with plenty of time to spare . we got everyone organized , we got the panic under control , and we got the emergency signals transmitted . when the ships arrive , our people will be waiting for us , and everyone will make it through . it wo nt even be that long , just a little over a year . we kept those ships in perfect shape , exactly according to procedure , and they were designed to operate continuously for decades . a year is nothing . my only regret is that when my husband wakes up , he s going to realize that i lied to him , and he s going to be really upset . newline newline the complete report will be in the appropriate place on every sleepship , of course , but for anyone reading this journal , please make note that the launch bay of these science stations needs a redesign . do nt let that get forgotten . i understand the security concerns due to the large amount of air that would be lost by an improper opening , but the inability to set a timed release means that in case of an emergency , a trained engineering officer with authorization codes has to be physically present at a console to open it , or worse , two suited workers per door to use the manual override . newline newline give my apologies to my husband . when i told him that chief engineer suresh was going to die a hero , i was nt really lying . if he had nt gone into the reactor core itself to disengage the damage controller completely , none of us would have made it . he would nt have survived being transferred to the sleepships after his burns , so i eased his passage last night . as second of engineering , i was the most logical one to stay behind to operate the doors . the reactor will go critical in about 18 hours , so we actually made it with breathing room to spare . newline newline but i can see the telemetry on the ships coming back , on each and every one of you , and i m genuinely happy . i know that he s going to make it . i know my daughter is going to make it . please make sure he knows i did nt go out afraid or crying . newline newline i am alone , but i am happy .the broken moon hung in the sky like a fluorescent jigsaw , a sharp reminder of the price humanity had paid this time . in the faint light below , a grey haired man was searching the tombstones of an old , overgrown cemetery . he stopped in front of one marked : newline newline newline lady abbess mera crabone newline newline murdered by darkfolk along with 102 of her beloved orphans in the year 662 of the sixth age .  newline newline may the light shine on her in the next age and beyond .  newline newline newline newline he knelt in front of it and closed his eyes . fingering a trinket around his neck , which he had carried for as long as he could remember , gratefulness filled him . for the first time in the decades since that fateful night he let the memories flood his mind . he let himself think back to what had happened , friends lost , but new ones found . he could let himself relax now , it was finally over . he had done his duty , and it was time to buy that farm . he knew of course that this wasn  t the end , the cycle of gods and men and the six ages never ends , but it was one end , his end , and to him it was a happy ending . newlinethree days ago : newline newline newline newline she got the wedding invitation on her

dont know why , she doesnt say . tears stream down her face and i sometimes hear her pleading with dad not to go , that we have enough money now and that he can close his business down . i sometimes ask mom why she is upset and try to comfort her . i hug her and tell her dad will be home soon . i miss him too when he goes on his business trips . newline i dont really understand what these business trips are , mom tells me that dad is very busy and has to meet important people to take care of stuff in the office . newline newline its strange though because i sometimes hear dad talking to other people , the people always look around like they are nervous and dont like me . i see them sometimes hand dad a paper bag , like what my mum packs my lunch in for school . and then dad goes away with his big suitcase . newline newline yesterday some people came , they told my dad that there was business to take care of , and that he had to help some people make arrangements with god . that s odd though because i thought people only got to see god when they die . they hand dad a piece of paper , i think i see a picture of someone . dad mumbles something back to them but i dont hear it . they have a suitcase that they open and theres lots of money . i guess his business made lots of money these friendly men bought to him . newline newline dad takes the suitcase and shakes their hands . then suddenly they take both of dads hands and say something about police . mom runs into the room crying , pleading with them to let dad go . i run down the stairs , and dad is shocked to see me , he thought i was already asleep . i ask the men what they are doing with my dad . why have they come for him ? newline newline one of the men shows me a badge that says fbi and has a picture of him . he says that my dad has been bad , that he had hurt lots of people and that he needs to go to jail . newline newline everything falls into place , the money , the men , the pictures , the whispering , the business trips with the big suitcase , it all makes sense now . my dad kills people and now the police are taking him away forever .they called themselves watchers . fancy name for a group of internet denizens bent on wasting their time . the first time i saw it , it was interesting  a neat play on an old trick . and it was pretty strange that nobody could figure out how it worked  the code was a garbled mess , and nobody could find the source . so people watched , as the loop lengthened by a second or two each cycle . the same primal impulse that pushed humanity to dominate their frontiers now drives their obsession over pointless mysteries . newline newline you ca nt refresh the gif , or leave the page , or do anything else with your computer , or it resets . one watcher , posting from his phone , complained that the loop he d had going for a month had reset . another actually invited him to his house , so he could keep watching .  you need to keep watching ,  he said ,  or you wo nt reach the end .  that was the day i stopped watching the watchers . newline newline three months later , i got an update from a friend that the infamous empty.gif had been taken down . only computers that had already been watching were able to view it . i checked in on the subreddit again , a little curious how people would react . not a soul on the sub had given up  some had lost power and been forced to move in with other watchers  fucking weird  but everyone was still watching contentedly . as far as i could tell , the loop had reached hours in length , and still it was nothing more than an empty room through a shaky camera . i shook my head , more than a little disappointed that something so mundane had reached cult status . newline newline yesterday , the sub blew up . the loop , which i guess was now around half a day in length , seemed to finally show something . nobody could talk about it , but conversation was rife with awed comments .  did you see it ?   beautiful .   fucking so much better than i expected .   i do nt even know where to begin .  newline newline my curiosity piqued , i asked in a few threads if they could explain what they say . a few other mildlyinterested lurkers did the same , but we all got the same response , from every single poster .  you have to watch .  i explained that you ca nt access the gif anymore , and received nothing but scathing silence in return . it s strange , but i could almost feel their contempt through the monitor . each thread i posted in died , members of the sub moving to the next thread as though avoiding a leper . i slammed my fist against my desk . was i really intrigued now ? i had to know what was in that room . newline newline a friend of mine had been pretty interested in the watchers , and had loops of the gif on both of her computers . i texted her asking if i could come over . the response :  sorry , gabe . i m almost finished watching .  an alarm went off in my head . no . she only lived a few hours away . i resolved to drive over and ask her in person . in the car , i kept one eye on the subreddit , watching for posts similar to katie s message . there were a halfdozen celebratory threads and responses :  grats everyone , see you on the other side .   we ve arrived !   praise the watch !   he sees us seeing ! he sees us seeing  newline newline he sees us

swerved into the other lane . i dropped my phone and jerked the wheel , veering into the divider . my car tilted onto two wheels , then flipped . newline newline it hurt . i knew it hurt , my head was ringing . i was upside down , bleeding . but it did nt matter . my phone had landed on the roof of my car , which was now the floor . i grabbed it , and refreshed the subreddit again . but there was nothing . no messages . the sub had disappeared . i pushed on my door handle and kicked the car open . i rolled out into the street , causing another driver to honk and swerve to miss me . i waved absentmindedly , then ran toward the sidewalk and started walking , stumbling occasionally . i was almost to katie s house . newline newline i pounded on the door .  katie ! it s gabe , open up ! i need to see !  nothing . there was no response . i gripped the handle and turned as hard as i could , to no avail . i backed off the porch and ran over to the side of the house . i grabbed a rock from the landscaping and slammed it into the window . it shattered , and i dove through , slicing my abdomen on the pane s jagged remnant . i tumbled inside and leapt to my feet .  katie !  still no answer , no shriek of alarm . i ran upstairs to her computer . her bedroom reeked of human waste , but i barely noticed . katie was gone . all that remained was her computer and monitor , glowing softly in the dark room . i lunged for the monitor and grabbed it with both hands . the gif was still there ! the loop was only a few seconds , but if i waited , i would get to see what katie saw , before she left . i said a silent prayer to the room , and sat down , arms curled around my legs .perhaps they built a better life than us . perhaps . newline newline encountering the alien probe once and for all settled the question of whether or not others lived and breathed as we did in between the stardust . bitterly , it came just as my species neared its quiet slip into tranquil oblivion  a base disease that worked over generations through our genes to close our eyes and still our hearts . few of us , i among them , were sentenced to watch billions fall into a sleep from which there is no end . spared is too optimistic a word . newline newline my species had its share of problems . devastating bigotry and malice consumed our cultures . but what the aliens sent was paradise , images and sounds of all manner of wondrous possibilities of which we will never truly know . i like to think that this is what they were like . what they still are like if hope prevailed . that they never slipped into the dark asunder of their natures . maybe . newline newline we drift now , composing final messages for the eons should anyone ever find us . we have pointed ourselves towards the presumed origin of the alien messenger , hearts twinkling that another species may know of our dreams and of our arts and of our motivations . perhaps they will remember us when but even the stars fade . newline newline arrival in 5 minutes .  newline newline talk about a huge relief ! hearing the ships a.i . prompted me to look out into the void , something i ve refused to do as i have accepted my fate to plunge into the black hole at the center of our home galaxy . the relief was seeing that there was more than nonexistence waiting for us . by the looks of it , joe  stabbed a guy  venturi was right . directly in front of the bow of our transport was a towering facility that at this point , i had no idea what s awaiting me or the rest of the prisoners aboard the scarborough convict transport . newline newline within minutes of touching down , things immediately did nt feel right . our guards seemed as clueless as the prisoners as to why the welcoming station seemed abandoned . suddenly a figure burst through a door leading into the belly of the facility , a giant shiny , purple ... . something ... shoved passed us and nearly knocked over a couple guards as he screamed  chickma ! flambo chickma ! churru !  one of our guards grabbed him ... her ? well , the guard grabbed it and tried to get some answers .  we are earth transport scarborough , language english . newline newline before he could ask anything , the creature replied in flawless english ,  they ve taken control ! all will die !  in unison every convict i had traveled here with turned their heads to the screams and roars and explosions heard from behind the door . newline newline  bleegle this ! i m leaving !  the shiny purple thing exclaimed as he shoved his way past the distracted guards . newline newline  so ... who s ready to head back to earth ?  lemmy  the joker  denzlen had his hand raised as an explosion knock the door leading to a hallway off its hinges and all of us to the floor . heavy ground shaking footsteps foreshadowed the giant humanoid figure that came ducking through the doorway . behind him was an army of mismatched creatures fighting amongst themselves and biting the throats of captured guards . newline newline  your ship . i want .  the giant struggled to inform . all the convicts from our ship parted a path to the door and pointed at captain sterling who had pissed himself as he blocked the door to the landing zone .  newline newline the giant beast pointed and screamed as the army of creatures attacked sterling and tossed the entrycontrol fob up to the juggernaut s towering hand . a second , much smaller creature stepped from behind the giant . he opened his mouth which took up about 34 of his face and announced in an unearthly loud voice .  convicts of earth ! we are like you ! the undesirables of the universe ! we have been abused in this earth funded prison for millennia , some of us even longer than that ! we have taken it ! it is ours now ! come ! join us as we travel to earth ! soon we will take that too !  i d lwike to congradulate you mrs. clinton on an excellent race .  newline newline  always a loser

vote for me , do we need to tell them that they vote today , someone do that reddit ama thing and tell my people  newline newline  hey sanders , i ve been meaning to ask you , how did you make so much money without lying ?  newline newline  it was very simple , and let me share with you why . the people have been feeling very pressured . we ve seen people have to work harder for a living . see that bartender , there s only one , there should be three of four bartenders . maybe i cwould orda a drink around here .  newline newline  i happen to like that bartender cause it s my bartender and once he served me a drink in a small glass , it made me feel small , so i fired him  newline newline  no trump , that was a shot glass  newline newline  ha ha gwood one hillary  newline newline  diid

trump did you see it ? did you see him ? newline newline he was there , tell me you saw him ! it has been months since that new neighbor moved in . every night i catch him staring through his curtained window directly into my apartment . he watches with his large , brown eyes and i feel my skin crawl . every night . every night ! newline newline as i move across my house i feel his eyes follow me . i feel the burning sensation in the back of my neck even with my blinds pulled shut . even not being able to see him i know he is there , watching , searching . every spot , every night . newline newline here i sit in my den , my feet hard against the wooden floor . my drink has already become warm , the ice melted and the perspiration upon teh glass puddled on the countertop . i chewed the inside of my lip and stared at the darkened window , blinds pulled tightly shut . small streams of twilight peaked through the corners and danced off various pieces of my living room . newline newline darkness had fallen . newline newline  we will see how he likes it .  i mumbled , irritated . newline newline dressed in black i decided to move around the back of the house . it was the easiest to access through the porch . there i waited , listening for sounds inside the unfamiliar house . i peaked through the porch window and saw him . there ! there he was , watching . newline newline he sat on a chair pressed against the window , eyes focused on my house across the way . he only moved to adjust when his legs grew tired . he was alone , his wife and child were probably asleep upstairs . newline newline with a quiet flick of my wrist and the instruments in hand i pried the porch sliding door open , moving it to the side in silence . once the doorway was wide enough , i slid in sideways and shut it behind me . newline newline nice place , i thought . but soon turned my eyes back to the man at the window . he was focused , i could see the glow of his phone in his hand and a camera on a tripod to his side . was he taking photographs of me ? newline newline he breathed a heavy sigh , i was so close i could smell the heavy coffee on his breath . newline newline  taking pictures ?  i asked . newline newline the man jolted forward and spilled coffee across his legs . he was speachless , terrified . i glared at those eyes , that face that had been invading my person space for months . i stood above him and glared . newline newline  you have been watching me .  newline newline  what ! no ... i mean ...  he searched for words , the fear taking over . he was shaking violently , his hands shivering and unable to hold his phone in his palm . it clattered across the floor and slid to my feet . bright and lighting up my boots and black jeans . dialed in and ready to call were the police . newline newline  how much have you seen ?  i asked .  how many are on the camera ?  newline newline the man shivered ,  please ! i have seen nothing !  his eyes darted back and forth looking for a weapon or a savior  i could not tell . he breathed in hard , raspy breaths .  please ... i will say nothing .  newline newline i shrugged and pulled the knife from my belt ,  too late now .  i said squatting before him . i watched as his eyes watered up and spittle dripped forth from his lips as he pleaded . newline newline  please ...  he begged ,  please !  newline newline  do nt worry , i wo nt forget about your wife or child .  newline newline he would not be staring at me any longer , i would make sure with a smile on my face . newlineit was the ears , he decided , adjusting the straps of his backpack after almost losing his boot in the mud . john kept his gaze focused on the back of the head on front of him , trying not to see the land as they passed by . shin  s head bobbed softly out of time with his , focused forward . he had immediately trusted shin upon meeting him , years ago . something about his presence made john feel at ease . the time between then and now had cemented that trust with reliability , but it was definitely the ears that had done the job first . newline newline they were pointed , and stood on end like a cat  s . they always seemed to be moving slightly , scanning the area , listening for something . shin had once told john that his home planet had large predators on it , and that it was only natural to be aware . john found himself remembering that conversation , and the pained look when he had asked why they hadn  t simply removed the predators , like the people of earth had done with most of theirs . newline newline his thoughts were interrupted by the feeling of a sound . it was a sound so immense that you knew it was coming before you ever heard it . he leaned against a mound , tightened his muscles and waited . the sense grew into a feeling  vibration and movement  coming from everything . the frequency of the vibration went up and up , until it seemed he caught up with it all and the ground was suddenly still . newline newline the roar hit him like a physical blow , throwing him to the ground under the force of his own spasming muscles . a small pile of wet earth rolled itself onto him , and he managed to push it away just in time to watch the linari ship pass overhead . then shin was there , pointed ears and thin eyes , holding out a hand . john took the hand and stood up , brushing the dirt off himself . newline newline  damn things ,  he said to no one in particular .   for your own good  ,  cus layin in the mud shittin myself is all i ever wanted.  newline newline shin looked sideways at him , his own eyes focused on the craft .  the linari truly believe they are helping you , you know.  newline newline  you  re helping me . i don  t need the kind of help they give.  newline newline shin looked at him for a moment and then smiled ,  yes , a wise choice.  newlinei sat across the dark suited men , looking every bit the g man  . the story they told was preposterous , crazy even . but if it were true ... newline  how can you prove it to me ?  i asked . the eldest agent looked to the others , then opened up a small briefcase he had been holding . inside was a small flag on a plastic stand , almost comical in its whimsical size . newline  ah , greetings , new president . welcome to the job .  a voice said in my head . i looked about , only to hear a laugh .  i m speaking directly into your mind , do nt look about like a maroon .  newline  who or what are you ?  i inquired . newline  i am the representative of the flag . i ve been doing this since roosevelt was in charge .  the flag explained . newline  which one ?  newline  would nt you like to know . listen , we could sit here and chit chat all day , but we simply have a demand of you .  the flag waited for the inevitable question . newline  what is it you want ?  i began to drum my fingers against the table , anything to help myself feel rooted in reality . newline  we need more school children . ever since the pledge of allegiance  started , we ve been feeding off of the patriotic fervor behind it . and we ve grown too , my how we ve grown . do you realize how many flags there are around the world ? why , we re everywhere . and we know all your secrets . feed us , and live in freedom .  the silence in my head was only interrupted by a cough from one of the agents . newline  do ... do you know what it is to be an american ?  i asked aloud . the agents looked to me , confused , but did nt answer . the flag managed an inquisitive hmm  . i continued ,  being an american is freedom , itself . not what you said , freedom to breath , freedom to just keep living . being an american means freedom to choose . people do what jobs they want , go to what schools they want , drive what cars they want and own whatever objects they want .  newline i stood up , like i was making a grand speech .  being an american means the freedom to do what i want in my own bedroom with any consenting partner , it means the freedom to live wherever i want . but most importantly ,  i leaned down to put my face right by the flags cloth  it means freedom of speech . and by speech , i mean all forms of expression .  with a quick flick of a bic , i lit the flag aflame . newline the agents looked aghast , glancing from one to the other , until finally settling their gaze upon me . newline  i have a decree , an executive order . open up a forum to decide upon a new flag , something entirely different from this one . and send out agents to gather all the flags and burn them . that any president before me let this threat grow is ridiculous .  i sat down , all at once tired . a small voice spoke into my head again . newline  fool , you ca nt get us all , you ve just started a war you ca nt hope to win . you should ve just followed our orders !  newline i looked to the melting pile of plastic and cloth and smirked .  you re dealing with an american here ... we do nt do well with orders from other authorities ... kinda how we got started .  and with a slap , i crushed the remains .time here is nt like time anywhere else . you never know who you re going to have to go around with . they could have died a thousand years ago , and come in today . insofar as today  means anything . i just call it the now  . newline newline i think i ve probably done a tour of the place ... maybe fifty times ? there s no reason to tour  other than the place is painfully dull and if you do nt keep moving , you ll just go crazy . newline newline most of them are just depressing . sylvia plath  i had her a while back . that turned out pretty much the way you d expect it . lots of them turn out like that . i had chris farley for a while . you d think that would be fun . felt like a goddamn eternity . want to know what the takeaway from that whole experience was ? he missed drugs . newline newline they re fragile , the famous ones . i had christopher marlowe for a while . do not mention shakespeare to that guy . newline newline the worst ones are the ones you used to respect . you want to know if someone s a dick ? walk around limbo with them . ghandi ? surprisingly racist . malcolm x ? dude would not stop talking about nailing white chicks . do nt get me started on jim morrison . most boring guy i ever met . newline newline you get surprised . kurt cobain laughed his ass off all the time . marilyn monroe was obsessed with quantum mechanics . newline newline if i had to say a favourite ? hitler . man , that was a good time . you know the peanuts cartoons , where lucy pulls the football away from charlie brown just before he kicks it ? it was like that . only he could nt move his balls quickly enough . newline newline i do nt know how many more times i ll have to go through this before i get out . newline newline anyway , that s my story . i know i m rambling on a lot . newline newline no , dude . that was nt a cue for you to start talking . we re gon na start talking about neverland ranch and you re gon na end up like hitler . just ... do nt . i wanted to talk to you . i feel like after all that s happened , after all that i ve gone through ... i still need something to do . can you help me ?  newline newline  i could , but anything i offer is going to seem ... let s see , what did you say about my boring tasks ? i ca nt seem to remember what you said about my boring , stupid tasks ,  sagramor smiled . newline newline he chuckled .  i apologize , but i could nt see where i would end up back then .  laoch sat down in front of his mentor for one last cup of tea . they both sipped their tea until sagramor replied . newline newline  to be fair , not even i realized just how much you would change . however , there is still one thing i still hope you enjoy .  the old man pulled out a deck of cards . he shuffled and cut the deck before dealing them out .  do you still remember how to play ,  he asked . newline newline there was a big grin on his face .  you know how bad i am at this game ,  said laoch . just as reluctantly as before , he picked up his cards . it was a close game , but the outcome was different this time and it took him by surprise . he won . newline newline  you re going easy on me , are nt you ?  newline newline  i ve always gone easy on you . you ve just stopped going easy on me ,  sagramor joked . the old man laughed . the laughing turned into a brief coughing fit . newline newline the expression on his face turned grim ,  i did nt want to bring this up , but i just ca nt get it off of my mind . he said something to me right before i killed him .  newline newline  who ?  newline newline  you already know . he said you were going to die . he said he had already gotten to you . that ca nt possibly true , right ?  newline newline sagramor did nt respond . instead , the look on his face was everything laoch needed to know . newline newline  i thought you were immortal ...  newline newline  i was . the spell can be broken , you know . it just takes a man like him to be able to break an immortality spell .  newline newline  so you re dying ? !  his voice was becoming a bit broken . tears started welling up in his eyes just thinking about losing sagramor . newline newline  do nt be so gloomy . i never liked that about you ,  he stated . he tried his best to avoid the word dramatic . newline newline  i m gloomy ? this coming from the man who always told me i was going to die !  the tears were coming full force now . newline newline  look , i m quite regretful abou   newline newline the hero interrupted with ,  i do nt care , i just do nt know what i m going to do if i lose you ,  exclaimed laoch ! he put his head down on the table and cried into his arms . the master gave a blank stare . newline newline  calm down ! i m not dead yet ,  sagramor declared . the hero got up and wiped his face with his sleeves . an awkward silence came between them until the hero thought about his original question . newline newline  listen ... i m sorry . just ... can you please answer one question ?  newline newline  certainly .  newline newline  what am i supposed to do now ?  newline newline  well , what do you want to do ?  newline newline  anything you need me for , master .  newline newline  well , i have but one command for you to follow until death finds you .  sagramor decided to play into laoch s dramatic nature . newline newline the hero gulped the rest of his tea , stood up with his fist over his heart and kneeled in front of the old man .  i will accept your wisdom , whatever it may be .  newline newline  good . this may prove to be your greatest challenge yet . greater than anything you have faced so far . are you ready to accept this challenge , soldier ?  newline newline the hero hyperventilated . that same feeling of uncertainty from all those years ago came creeping back into the pit of his stomach . with bravado , he puffed his chest and choked out his answer ,  yes .  newline newline  good . i ask you , brave soldier , to live . simply live . whatever that entails is up to you .  newline newline this puzzled laoch .  what do you mean ?  newline newline  i ca nt teach you everything . especially now that i m no longer immortal . i ve already taught you everything i know . you ll learn everything else by choosing to live life . i ca nt teach you how to do that .  newline newline laoch , still uncertain , stood up with his fist still over his heart . he said ,  i will see this through to the end , master .  newline newline  i would nt have it any other way ,  sagramor said . he smiled at him and laoch s heart swelled . he still had no idea what that meant . barbara .  i started . my carefully thought out introduction falling to shambles as she opened the door to her home . dear god she was just as beautiful as i remembered . so many years had passed for me but she was still in her early thirties . newline newline her jewel green eyes opened first in surprise before her face flashed through several emotions . the surprise gave way to recognition , which turned into anger which quickly became pity as she noted the slumped shoulders , the gray hair , liver spots and cane i now needed to walk .  jim .  she finally said to me , concern replacing the pity and causing her to frown . newline newline  i ... i do nt have much time now barbara . may i come in ?  newline newline she hesitated and i felt fear . so badly i wanted to sit down one last time , so that i could say goodbye . finally , she squared her shoulders as if she were about to do battle and i knew she had decided . without a word she stepped to the side and ushered me in . newline newline the house was smaller than i remembered but that was because she had filled it with her belongings . i remembered pleading for her to let me buy a bigger place for them , that it was the least i could do . newline newline  what do you want jim ?  her voice came from behind me . she was still standing at the door . probably trying to decide if she wanted to open it back up and kick me out . newline newline  tell me what you re here for jim !  this time there was a catch in her voice . no no no , i had nt wanted her to cry . before i could open respond she continued in a rush . the carefully held emotions rushing out . newline newline  for you to show up here looking like that i know your time has run out jim ! years and years ago we both talked about how playing with time was going to catch up to you but you refused to listen ! there was always a another villain you needed to stop . even when i walked out of your life you could nt stop  newline newline i was silent after her accusations . they were all true . back then i thought i needed to save everyone . be a hero everywhere . while back at home i lost more and more chances to spend time with my wife and show her how much i love her . until it finally became too much . she packed up and left . newline newline  barbara ... is ... is there a way i can see him once more ?  i could barely speak through the catch in my own throat . newline newline  i m sorry jim , i m so so sorry but the answer is no . i gave you that chance years back and still you were too busy .  she scoffed before speaking again .  a man who can control time yet never spends any with the most important people in his life .  newline newline  please  newline newline again she squared her shoulders and this time her voice hardened .  get out jim . i do nt know why you even came here . i will take good care of our son , you know that but i never want to see you again .  she finished , opening the door through which i came in . newline newline as i hobbled back out onto the street i turned to look at her once more . she was putting up a good front but tears were still glittering at the corners of her eyes . with a last look at me she closed the door . newline newline  goodbye barbs .  i said to the closed door . there was only one time jump left in me . as i walked to my final destination i let my own tears fall , in memory of the time i had wasted .drats , i thought . i made my way through the kitchen , found my laptop on the counter , and pulled up google chrome . newline newline i typed in runescape cooking bot , downloaded the firmware , and went went to the stove top . i cooked shrimp until level 15 , then trout until 18 . i mindlessly completed the tasks , thinking about pking as my body went through the motions . newline newline a message popped up in my head .  you have broken the runescape rules , infringement : botting . 24 hour ban .  newline newline drats . newline newline i logged out , shut my laptop , and had worked myself up an appetite . it was still early so i thought i would fry an egg . newline newline as i reached for the stove top , a message appeared : level 18 cooking required . newline newline newline drats . inception music is he here yet ?  dr. schringer asked while slipping on his latex gloves , resulting a thick , satisfying , slap sound . newline  almost , he just has to get through security .  dr. mako replied . the bright laboratory was lit up by dozens of fluorescent lights . behind rows of empty monitors and data collecting devices sat a large blue tarp , with strange , wolf like bones . newline  i am here !  the automatic doors opened up .  hiss !  a man wearing dark red , gold , and blue robes walked in . his dark skin revealed that his flesh had been kissed by the evening sun for years . dark , muted blue eyes hid a secret that only he knew . newline  greetings , scientists . i hope you all are doing as well as me , ha ha .  his laugh was quiet and subtle , yet booming and passionate . newline  nice to meet you . and what would you like us to call you ?  dr. mako asked . newline  just call me the converter . nothing else .  the frail man replied solemnly . newline  well , we wanted you to resurect this interesting specimen . it looks to be an ancient wolf ?  dr. schringer droned on . newline  yes , all that information is nice , but the only thing that matters is that we comfort its soul and make it feel welcome .  newline the scientists , obviously intrigued by this rather spiritual statement , look at him with faces of disbelief . newline  whwhwhat do you mean by that ?  dr. mako asked while brushing her red hair out of her face . newline  all matter in the universe can be sent into the future or past states of its existence . its soul must be comforted before it can be sent back . it needs to feel warm . it needs to hear the call of its mother whispering in its ear . yes , you can leave . farewell , young one  before journeying off . i will do that now .  schringer and mako watched as the man shuffled over to the tarp with ancient bones .  now , now little one . it is time to come home .  he made waving hand motions over the pile of remains before kissing the air . a bright flash and pop of air echoed through the room , and the scientists covered their eyes . when the smoke had risen , the old man was holding a young wolf puppy in his arms . its tail wagged , its bright green eyes showing its playfulness as it yipped in eagerness . newline  you , you did it !  newline newline  now do you realize that not every living thing is yet another specimen ?   newlinei hope the decision was nt as fast as it looked . there were a lot of things going on when it happened and she moved so quickly it was hard to tell if she even hesitated to weigh all the options . newline newline well , i guess there really were nt any options . her or me . rational logic dictates self above all else , so i suppose there s really no faulting her . newline newline we d come to this country to help , too . humanitarian goals . that seems funny now as i bounce around in the back of a van with a black bag over my head . we d been approached by the company to go and disrupt human trafficking elements around the mountains . apparently it was such a massive source of revenue for the bad guys that operations were finally being conducted to curtail it . newline newline she spoke so fluently too , of course she was going to get selected for the op . i was just here because i m a good shot and handy with an aid bag . we came in under the guise of a medical mission . it took months to finally track all the routes and shore up all of the potential contacts into reliable marks . all that effort , even a few dozen girls and boys freed , some even returned to their parents . newline newline this last meeting was supposed to be the last meeting . we were heading to link up with one of the guides that led the vans carrying human cargo into the darkness and the ether of whatever awful place those folks end up . it had all sounded fishy from the start . what war lord was going to just let outsiders medically inspect his cargo when he could just as easily sell the sick kids to a creepy customer as double the price . newline newline when those first guys pulled their rifles up from under their coats i was swearing under my breath that i d hidden my pistol so far around my back . but then she just threw me under the bus like that . pushed me forward and told them i was a traitor , sold me out in a second . newline newline on the plus side , i think they let her go , so there s always the chance she could get help to me in time . but so many people vanish in these mountains in so many awful ways ... newline newline she was better suited to finish the mission anyways . i hope i m a life spent and not wasted .as i heard the creak and groan of the large metal door close , i had never been happier . i had finally done it , i was able to donate all of my protective gear . hairnets , arm guards , industrial grade turtlenecks ... all of it gone . newline newline today was bites people s 18th birthday and she passed her test . she completed the binding process and found her talent . newline newline i can still remember the day we took her home from the hospital . i do nt think you d find anything cuter than seeing a newborn who would try and bite you . like the frog and boiling water , we did nt quite realize how precipitous the drop would be ... newline newline by 3 months , her mother had to stop breast feeding . newline newline by 1 year , we had to limit our family seeing and holding her . newline newline by the time our ankles had become unrecognizable , we bought the first piece of our  collection  , a matching pair of black and white hightop chuck taylors ...the detective entered the interrogation room . it was cold , he wondered if it was the room , or that piece of filth s heart . newline the murderer was sitting quietly and polite , postured perfectly upright . newline as if he were a statue . the detective sat directly in front of him . newline the murderer hasnt taken his eyes off of him since he entered the room . newline the detective struggled to keep the anger from his voice , as he said newline  where is your research ?  as soon as the words left his mouth the murderer responded with  you mean my masterpiece ? my mona lisa . newline my starry night .   whatever the hell it is . where is it ?  newline the anger showing in the detective s voice this time . newline  my price is simple . you pigs drop all charges . and i will take you straight to my masterpiece . to save all those pathetic wretches from the inevitable .  he said with no emotion at all . after some thought , the detective and his precinct reluctantly agreed . newline it was a cold , miserable , wet night . the car ride was just as miserable . made worse by the murderers constant giggling .  shut the hell up .  the detective said annoyed . the murderer did nt stop however . the giggling ringing in the detective s mind .  it s just up ahead . hehehehe . i hope you like it .  he said eerily . the shed was worn down , and old . the shingles were falling off , and on both sides  hello detective .  was written in blood . newline how the hell did he know i would be coming ? the detective

are taking over the world . newline newline he had the worst luck , after wandering alone for close to six months  george had finally managed to find a group that would take him in . that was yesterday morning , this morning they were all dead and already risen . he could not see how it had happened , how could one of those dead things slip through the alarm bells without making a noise , and what more where was it ? it was not a great leap to conclude that one of their group must have been bitten and didn  t tell anyone . it always happened this way for george . newline newline george was beginning to believe he was cursed  how could anyone be this unlucky ? was he destined to live through this apocalypse completely alone ? none of the deceased seemed to bother with him  they never did , not since the beginning . he could never understand why . newline newline in the beginning , he and six others had holed up in a basement of the university for which they had all worked . they were running low on supplies , and since it was quiet out there , two of his group had volunteered to scout for more supplies . george himself was too frightened to join the mission , no one said anything , but it was obvious that people were growing irritated with him . seven people locked away in a basement are bound to get irritated with each other after all . newline newline the scouting mission hadn  t gone entirely to plan . both of them managed to return , but ned had been bitten in the shoulder . when the discovery was made , there was panic amongst the group . no one wanted to do anything , ned had been the strongest member of the group . he had saved everyone  s life at least once , it was a devastating loss . no one would say anything , except george . newline  he can  t stay here ! he  s bit ! he  ll turn !  newline newline this was met with the ever more frequent disgusted looks from the rest of the group , but no one argued and george did not desist . things escalated quickly , and ned ended up attacking george . they were pulled apart be the rest of the group , but not before ned managed to take a good bite out of george  s arm . by this point , ned was crying and george was screaming , he hardly noticed ally , another group member disinfecting his arm with the remaining gin they had left . newline  better than nothing  ally said doubtfully . newline newline it did seem better than nothing , as george woke up the next morning completely fine . the bite had almost healed and george had not turned . that is more than he could say for the rest of the group . ned had been tied to a pipe in the corner , but it would seem that they did not tie him soon enough , as the rest had been bitten . george always wondered who it was that managed to tie ned

examined my surroundings . newline newline there was a lone mountain off in the distance , one of the barren moons looming over it in the sky . a strangely shaped building overcome with plants and trees directly to my left . outside of the small clearing around my ship , there was only dense rainforest and foreign plants . animals laughed from the treetops , their screeches piercing the thick warm air . the eyes of beasts of prey could be seen in the treeline , watching my every move . newline newline i carefully pulled enough supplies from the ship in a pack i could carry , along with my blaster and a katana to hack through the densely packed forest . newline newline i closed the shuttle and set out with the sun hanging high in the sky . the roatation and size of e7x relative to the

i could make out the blackened patch i had landed next to , and made out in that direction . as the katana sliced through the plants , a strange green liquid oozed from the split ends , bleeding into the ground . the soil of the ground was different . it was more red . contained different minerals . that could be why . newline newline as i carved my path , the plants immediately healed behind me , leaving no way for me to retrace my steps to the ship . newline newline the council had not told me much before coming here . they said the mission was to see if e7x was survivable , and they wanted me to set up some advanced equipment to allow the beginning of a coloney . i was not sold on the purpose of the mission . newline newline after 7 hours of carving a path in front of me , through the

of me . i wandered through the wreckage for hours , looking for any sign of life . it was getting dark very fast . in a matter of minutes , everything was pitch black . i could nt see my hands in

helmet on , thinking it may provide some protection if anything were to attack me . it was in that moment that i remembered . the helmets come equipped with a headlamp . duh . newline newline i struggled to find the button , my breathing intensified . as i pressed it in , the dark hellish world illuminated in a bright circle around me . at the edges of the light , a dark black curtain hung an otherworldly blackness as thick as oil . the air was getting harder to breathe . my helmet was nt clipped in . newline newline i decided it would be best to use it , rather than risk death . i had roughly 22 hours of oxygen . 2 hours short of being able to make it through the entire night . my vision was getting blurry . i started to drift off , still attaching my helmet . as my hands clasped down the last clip , i felt my consiousness slip . i fell in what seemed like slow motion , and the last thing i saw was my headlamp flicker out . newline newline lights flashed before my eyes and

then again , neither was batman , right ? his ony superpower was money . when things really get hard , i like to tell myself that batman would persevere . he d be content to give up the batcave and live in this fallingdown , ratinfested old factory too . he could deal with the constant loneliness , with nary a butler or sidekick in sight . choking down microwaved dinners and doing his best to

gang of henchmen . not when he owns a piece of every major company in town . not when he owns half the papers and almost all of the radio stations . not when the chief of police reports directly to

mayor . and yet i still lose , every time . the mayor has another superpowers : fucking lawyers . comic books never focus on things like chain of custody  of evidence , or hearsay  when you record the incriminating conversation , or duress  when you manage to politely  convince a thug to testify . the few times i ve managed to get the mayor dead to rights , and he walks away clean . that s assuming that i can even get him into a courtroom  most of the time , the evidence just magically disappears . i ca nt even scratch his public persona ! people love the bastard . like i said : he has

... and smiled .the patter of the pouring rain ran over the sidewalk david was standing upon . another day in this dreary forest of glass and steel monoliths . david would nt have even heard the bus if it were not for the water pooling in the crevice of the offkilter road . the door of the bus , angular and dark , slid open with the screech of a missing ballbearing . out of the mechanical orifice stepped a man . his appearance was straight out of the midtwentieth century , it had been a century and a half since anyone dressed like he did . the man approached david and handed him what at a passing glance looked to be nothing more than a small ball of trash . however this was nt mere trash , david had far underestimated what he had expected to be a just a crumpled up flyer for some third rate burger joint . david delicately unwrapped the amorphous crumple of paper to find a small metallic device resembling some sort of early 21st century tech . emblazoned across the back was 64 gb and a small angular logo . david boarded the bus and as soon as he was seated he glanced at the damp sheet of paper but the pen had run on the sheet and all he could make out were the words , it s your responsibility now . david decided to boot the device , across the screen flashed the word zune . he wondered if this was one of those ipod devices his parents had told him about as a child . he quickly navigated through the device yet only one thing was on it , a singular recording . he pulled out his earbuds from his bag and was shocked when they fit into the jack . newline newline  do not go home .  the recording urged  the people around you are not who they seem to be , get off of this bus at the next stop . today your life will change . all of human history , it s your responsibility now . at a young age i had used to go outside of my parent s villa just to go to an old playground by an abandoned schoolhouse . sure there were a few other kids that i could have hung out with , but the rusty old equipment and the gloominess of the place attracted me . an old seesaw that was so rusted that it was stuck , a slide that had metal chips poking through the surface , and monkey bars that looked like they would split in half with just a gentle tap . newline newline it was nt until the second week that i had gone to my special park that i noticed someone else there too . at first it was just slight movement out of the corners of my eyes , or the seesaw would give a sudden screech and move only an inch . i did nt mind as i spent most of my time sitting in the old mulch that lined the ground and stared at the sky , watching the time pass by and counting the clouds that were in shapes that i liked . newline newline that was when i met her  . as i was staring upwards while laying on my back , a girl suddenly leaned over into my vision . it was so sudden that i bolted upright with my heart threatening to breach my chest .  it s awfully lonely around here and i ve seen ya hang out around the school .  the girl says , both hands were clasped behind her back . as i had looked upon her with my eyes , there was something off about her . wether it be the nightgown she wore that looked like it could belong to my mother in her younger years , or when i looked upon her everything else around her seemed out of focus . newline newline  there s plenty a kids that hang around town . why do nt you go play with them ?  i ask while brushing the mulch off my clothing . now that i looked at her a little more closely i could see that she was about the same age as me , though a little taller . though with a glance towards her feet i see that she s barefoot ... ..and floating a couple of inches off the ground .  so that s why ... .your a ghost ?  the ghost girl gave a nervous nod while bitting her now translucent lip .  must a been pretty lonely then .  once more , the ghost nodded her head . newline newline  if ya do nt mind me asking before we hang out , how d ya become a ghosty ?  no sooner had the question left my lips , the air that surrounded her glowed a little red in tint before fading .  you know your not suppost ta ask a girl how she died .  she responds , something in her voice made me rethink about what i needed to do . so simply lying back down , i start to stare at the sky again . patting the spot beside me , i could feel a slight movement in the air as she laid beside me . it took her a few moments to make sure she was nt partially disappeared into the ground when i suddenly feel something icy grip my hand . newline newline i did nt have to look to know she had reached and was now holding my hand with her own . a somewhat quite sob came from her but i kept staring at the sky . i did nt have ta ask how she died , since i was there when it happened . it was the reason why i still came to this playground by myself . a couple months ago me and her were inseparable and came here often . at one point while it was raining we both came here to still play . there had been another plaything here as well at that time and it was in the best condition . as were playing on it in the rain as it spun around , she slipped and hand scratched her arm up from all the rust . she contracted a severe form of tetnis , so she had died later in her bed . yet she stayed in the mortal plane to continue to play with me . newlinemy coworkers were nearby , so i tried to keep the volume of my fart lower than usual . i think i would have done a better job if it had nt been for that military jet flying by over in montana . it was fucking terrifying . i m

nt feel the cold any more ? no , it means you re fucking sick of the cold . well i m fucking sick of hearing every single sound that happens within a ridiculously wide geographical range . anyways , the jet went by and i lost a bit of focus and i kinda farted harder than i even would have in the first place , which would be embarrassing , but not the worst situation in the world , if i did nt have astoundingly powerful ... eh ... gaspumping power . as it was , i did nt only kill karen , steve , marge , greg , and greg  there are ... were two gregs that i worked with  but i gave them a face

room towards her opponent . there had been weeks of preparation leading up to the final presidential debate before the election , and the long hours she put in had surely left nothing for frank underwood to do or say that would throw her off her game . she was wrong . newline newline  mr . underwood , the first question is for you ,  started the moderator ,  how can you respond to the criticisms about your lack of accountability in the past few months ?  newline newline  mr . moderator , thank you for your question , newline i am here tonight to give the country a good lesson , newline sure , some of my decisions may not have been agreed with , newline but handing over leadership to mrs. dunbar would be egregious !  newline newline absolute silence fell over the room , and across the country , as countless audience members shared looks of shock and disbelief . although mrs. dunbar was frozen in the position she had taken moments before , her mind was racing as it had countless times when she had faced unexpected situations in the courtroom . sure , underwood may have struck hard with such a surprising blow , but this debate was far from over . she looked up towards the camera and bellowed : newline newline  mr . underwood , i truly thank you for starting , newline let me give you the option right now to be departing , newline because if you don  t , and you decide not to get off , newline i  m going to tear you to pieces , then take your wife , like i was petrov  newline newline the audience continued to stare on in shock , unsure as to how they should be reacting . the moderator shuffled his papers in order to regain control of the situation , but before he could utter another word mr. underwood was ready with his response : newline newline  mrs . dunbar , i applaud your bravery , newline but my flow and use of words is like lyrical slavery , newline whatever anyone says i  ve been successful with amworks , newline wait , what about you ? aren  t you just some law clerk ?  newline newline the crowd jumped to its feet , roaring in support of the exaggerated last two words by underwood . he pumped his hands in the air and looked over at dunbar with a smirk that she just couldn  t stomach . as the crowd quieted down , she responded : newline newline  please quiet down so i can respond to mr. underwood , newline but if this is supposed to be fair , then maybe a less intelligent person should ? newline misappropriates funds while endangering lives , newline let  s all flip his ass off while you gim me high fives !  newline newline with that , dunbar immediately raised her middle finger while making her way around the roaring crowd . hands came flying out to meet hers as she circled around the stage . after she had completed a full round , she made her way back to her podium and glared back up at underwood . newline newline there was a smirk on his face . the battle had only begun . newlinelet me just start by saying , if you knew how anticlimactic dying actually is , you wouldn  t spend so much of your life worrying about it . seriously . in fact , if you knew what truly awaited you in the afterlife , i  d wager some of you wouldn  t bother working so hard to keep yourselves alive at all . does that sound callous ? sorry . i  ve been up here for a while . big g warned me i might be a bit  out of touch  when he asked me to sit down with you and tell you about heaven . in fact , he asked me not to editorialize about the whole dying thing at all . he  s kind of a needy guy , when it comes to keeping in touch with his  children.  kind of like your mom in that first month when you left for college , but times 30 billion . he  s got it in his head that , if you guys stopped being afraid of dying , you probably wouldn  t stay in touch as often or go through so much trouble to celebrate him . i mean , who wouldn  t want to have a temple built in their name , i guess . newline newline anyway , let  s back to the story so i can get back before the party starts tonight . where was i ? oh , yeah . newline newline i had no idea i was slated for death . seriously . for me , it was just another friday , and i had work to do . allen , my associate , had come for dinner . rosie , my maid  and also a hot little number  had braised a lamb to perfection , bless her . she couldn  t have done better if she  d known it was going to be my last supper . newline newline we talked business while we ate , and we drank scotch and relaxed while we digested both the food and each other  s comments . it had been a busy day , and i hadn  t had a chance to read the morning paper , which was sitting on the end table beside me . i reached over , and grabbed it . i was still reading the headlines when it happened . i took two shots to the head . but to be honest , i was gone before i even knew anything had happened . newline newline i thought i was dreaming for the first few minutes . i was on this pristine white escalator . i was all alone . i couldn  t remember what i had been doing , but it didn  t matter because the sunlight peeking through the clouds above was warm , there was relaxing music playing in the background , and a smell in the air that i actually still can  t place to this day but that brought on a flood of nostalgia . i couldn  t remember the last time i  d been so carefree , even in a dream . newline newline the nostalgia brought me down a rabbit hole , though . i don  t actually know how long i stood at the top , day dreaming absentmindedly about my childhood  the friends i had , the things my family used to do , the smell of my mom  s perfume . newline newline i didn  t notice big g right away . i don  t know how long he stood there , looking at me , before i finally zoned back in and noticed him . it was kind of a weird vibe though , like he had been able to watch what i had been reminiscing about , as well . he later told me that that  s the whole  life flashing before your eyes  thing , and it is kind of weird so just be prepared for that . the rest is awesome . newline newline big g definitely got a kick out of me . took him a long time to convince me that i wasn  t dreaming , i was actually dead . he had to resort to bringing me to his garden and showing me my life in his wishing well . i couldn  t deny that it was me being loaded onto the stretcher with two gunshot wounds to my head . i always knew i was in a dangerous business . newline newline the thing is , i had always just assumed i  d be going to hell . well , maybe not always , but from a pretty young age . i had made my peace with it long ago . and i had done some bad things along the way to pave my road to hell , just to make sure the trip wouldn  t be in vain . finding out that the whole thing was a lie big g made up to keep the kids in line was a pretty big letdown . newline newline he did have a pretty solid argument for keeping the charade up all these years . he explained that keeping the sins in check was the only way that so many of his children could live on such a tiny planet together . he also explained the science behind the current iteration of the study he is conducting and why he needs human beings on planet earth . keeping the sins free in paradise , he explained , was the only way to ensure that his children would want to return . newline newline it was around this time that what he called the  trolley  showed up . i  d say trolley is a pretty far stretch because the thing looked like a fucking roller coaster to me . we strapped ourselves in , and big g whopped as we raced away , immediately dropping 10 feet and then going up 50 . newline newline it was on top of that hill that it all began to make sense to me . the layout of heaven is part college campus , part las vegas , and part amusement park . as far as the eye can see , there are magnificent old buildings , wellmanicured parks and pavilions , even a water feature or seven . the trolley ran through the entire thing , and although it wasn  t clear what each district was at first , it was very clear that each district had a very different way of decorating . you  re thinking lights , you  re thinking colours , you  re thinking statues and shrubberytrimmed monuments . this place is out of this world . newline newline but from this view , it kind of does have its creepy amusement park side where you begin to understand that if you aren  t playing the game , the game is playing you . newline newline at lest big g will be straight with you . he  s a businessman , as well , after all . you  ve put in your lifetime , you  ve earned the right to an eternity of sin . but you must choose only one , and once you  ve decided , you must stay within that sin  s border . newline big g is a fair man , also , though in an onthebooks kind of way . and it  s your lucky day . if you sign this contract agreeing to go back for another lifetime , give him another case study , he  ll let you pick a second , and a third , and so on . newline newline although he admits very few people ever make it through to 7 . he finds that three , sometimes four , is usually sufficient . newline newline see , the thing is , as he  s explaining this whole thing to me , we both begin to realize that i know what he  s talking about and i can recognize every single territory out there before he names it  every territory but newline newline greed . newline newline how apt . a smile crosses my face as it all falls into place inside my head . i had a hell of a lifestyle . i lived my life like i wasn  t afraid of dying , and i didn  t have time for regrets . i begged . i borrowed . i stole . and then i built an empire on other people  s suffering . i did what i wanted and i loved every minute of it . newline newline in fact , i built a little hotel and casino that , it seems to me , would kind of fit in to this whole paradise setup . is there any way that could really be a coincidence ? newline newline big g saw it too , like the whole  life flashing before your eyes  thing , in a creepy way .  greed ,  he nodded at me , and the greed district lit up to my senses . delicous , delicious greed . newline i have to admit , it  s pretty humbling to have big g be in awe of you . there are only a handful of us here with allaccess passes , the high rollers , if you will . we get a new one every couple decades , it seems . newline newline i get it , though . those contracts ? man , the paperwork can be a realdrag . and then you  ve got to go down to the office and do the whole life blue print , and then you  ve got to wait for it to get approved , and the list goes on . but hey , now that we  ve got steve jobs back up here , maybe we can talk him in to making the whole application wireless . newline newline anyway , as i was saying when we first met , don  t spend too much of your life worrying about death . we  re all going to the same place at the end of the day . newlinehe had known this day was coming , but that didn  t change the fact that his son  s simple question had left him at a loss for words . the truth was , it had been hotly debated at each tribal council for the last 200 years . newline newline why do we hide from them , ha ! sure it was just that simple , we just happen to duck behind a bush everytime the humans look our way . never mind the ever more sophisticated technology being deployed in an attempt to catch us every year . tribal politics aside however , his son deserved an honest , practical answer .  newline newline morfblaht looked down into the face that was so much like his own at that age , just becoming a squatch , about to begin soaking up all the wisdom that would come when he successfully completed his spirit walk . the timing was perfect , his son clahkdorsh was now eight feet tall and had finally started to shed the spotted coat of a squatchling . newline newline clahkdorsh was absentmindedly playing with a stalk of hay , twirling it between his oversized fingers as he stared at the living thatched dome roof , woven so perfectly by his mother  s practiced hands . morfblaht inhaled deeply , savoring the sweet smells of the night , bushes , flowers , and the damp earth turned up by the evening s foragers . newline newline  they call us monsters , son.  morfblaht began  we have remained hidden for millennia , not because we do not wish to share ourselves with them , but because they are not yet ready for us . i believe one day we can live in harmony , openly , but it won  t be in my lifetime . they  re still much too dependent on the notion that they are somehow special , the pinnacle of evolution . they have a long way to go . until that day comes we  ll continue to evade them and allow them to call us what they will , yeti , sasquatch , bigfoot , apes , animals monsters.  newline122 newline newline he laid in bed . the leds pulled at his skin , and the tape holding the wires and tubes in place itched . newline newline  do you remember that sunday after your folks divorced .  she asked . newline newline he quietly smacked his lips , slow and with purpose . he swallowed gently and gave her a weak lethargic smile . she sat on the edge of the bed between the nurse and doctor and held his hand .  you were . . .  he breathed shallowly .  you were wearing the yellow dress .  he said , smiling .  with the blue flowers .  newline newline  yes .  she laughed , bending low to kiss his fingers . he saw that she was crying and reached up to wipe away her tears . newline newline  careful , walter . you ca nt move . it s important .  the doctor told him , leaning forward to adjust the equipment one last time . walter reluctantly lowered his arm and lay it beside him on the bed . newline newline  sorry , doc . i was just saying goodbye .  he murmured quietly . newline newline  walter , you re not going to die .  the doctor told him . newline newline he wanted to shake his head and laugh , but instead , he just moved his eyes to hers . they knew the truth . newline newline  the rain was warm . you remember that , walter ?  she asked . newline newline  i do . i remember dancing with you , surrounded by flowers and limbs laden and bent from the weight of too much rain . your hair was plastered , dark and dreadful . your sundress clung to your body , and i . . .  he swallowed and felt his eyes droop with exhaustion .  fell in love . i ve loved you all my life . i loved you .  he felt tears spill from his eyes and sneak down his cheek and chin and slide beneath his collar . newline newline  okay , walter .  the doctor told him .  it is very important that you do nt move or talk .  newline newline  will it hurt ?  walter asked . newline newline  you wo nt feel a thing .  the nurse assured him , taking his hand . newline newline  you re going to miss me when i m gone .  the girl whispered , standing up . newline newline he wanted to say goodbye , but the nurse placed a finger across his lips and shook her head . he blinked to let her know he understood and looked back to the girl . she smiled and backed away further . he felt different and closed his eyes as whatever the doctor was doing took effect . he felt pressure but no pain . it went on for several minutes . walter kept his eyes closed . he felt part of him slipping away , like slowly having having a skein peeled away , then with a victorious groan and grunt , the doctor exhaled in relief . newline newline  got it .  he said simply . walter waited for the nausceous feeling to go away before opening his eyes . newline newline  she s gone .  walter groaned , fighting the burning sensation he knew would end in body wracking sobs . newline newline  i know , walter . without the tumor , the hallucinations will stop .  the doctor told him soothingly . newline newline  but , i loved her .  he cried quietly .  all my life .  he could nt stop the tears . newline newline the nurse swallowed the lump in her throat and took her patient s hand .  i m sorry .  she whispered . newline newline  if we had waited . . .  the doctor said , leaving it hanging . walter pulled the nurses hand up and kissed it and cried some more . she gave him a brief hug and released his hand so she could start removing the halo holding his head still .  you still have the memories .  the doctor told him in an attempt to console him . walter continued sobbing long after and fell asleep with his tears drying on his cheeks . newline newline she had been right . he did miss her . hey charlie , i ve got some new gear for you .  newline newline gearhead447 is this junk trader . he s usually bringing pits and pans , cups , spoons , and the occasional block of cheese . he scrapes me dry of any extra coin i might have and leaves me with his trash . sure , he ll sometimes bring in the occasional piece of nice jewelry but i m a weapons dealer ! i do nt sell junk ! newline newline  gh , i really ca nt take anything besides weapons today . i ai nt got the time to go and trade with the other merchants . i have to keep my shop open .  newline newline  charlie , i do have weapons today . i have a ton of knives !  newline newline  gh , dinner knives do nt count .  newline newline  a knife is a knife and business is business . cough up some coin or you wo nt have a shop to keep .  newline newline gh is also known to have a temper . he s not too smart but word has gotten around that he is nt on the level . when he makes a threat he can usually deliver on it . newline newline  gh , your a bum . here s your damn coin .  newline newline he slides a pile of rusty butter knives across my counter and i slide a chopper each back in return . newline newline he starts counting and then grunts a couple times grudgingly . he covers the coin and turns around . but before he walks out , he does something weird . newline newline gh takes two steps forward , a step back , he jumps , and then couches . he turns around twice and draws his sword . newline newline i stand there staring wondering if he s finally lost it . then he opens his hand to see the copper . he looks frustrated and he starts cursing under his breath and starts over . newline newline  uh ... gh , do you need something else ? i can send fire someone if you need it .  newline newline ignoring me he starts cursing louder and getting a bit red in the face . but then he goes completely still . his face was blank and he s barely breathing . it s like the lights are lit but nobody s home . newline newline suddenly the light came back on and he shakes his head . newline newline  i forgot the second couch ... . why do i always forget that one .  newline newline i watch as he performs it all over again except gee couches twice this time . then he uncovers the coin to look again . to my utter amazement , the coppers are now all gold ! newline newline  what in bloody blazes ! ? gh , are you doin witchcraft in my shop ?  newline newline  i m a ranger . nothing magical about me ... it s a..um ... trick othe trade .  newline newline a rye smile appears in his face as he walks back up to the counter . newline newline  gh , i ca nt take that gold .  newline newline  no course not . but i almost forgot about the sword i found .  newline newline he pulls this sword out . does nt look like anything special . until he starts unsheathing it . it s made of pure diamond with a red glow about it . newline newline  gh , i do nt have coin to do that justice . maybe one of the merchants in darkdale . i know a guy .  newline newline a look of determination crosses his face . newline newline  ai nt got time ... . hold on a sec .  newline newline he steps back and freezes again . completely blank . then he stirs and couches . he sits there for a second while i m waiting for him to do something . newline newline  gh , no more tricks . i do nt have the coin and i m expecting a delivery .  newline newline  hold on a sec , charlie . it s worth thirty seconds o  your time .  newline newline he starts doing a different weird dance and jumping all around my shop . the he draws his sword again . newline newline  threatening me wo nt make me have more coin , gh .  newline newline  wo nt it ?  newline newline  what ?  newline newline he gives me this knowing look and sets the sword on the table . newline newline  charlie , check and see if you got some extra coin somewhere .  newline newline i shrug and shake my head but turn to check the purse i have in the shelf behind me . and there it is . a pile of gold ! enough to buy ten of his shiny swords ! newline newline  gh , what d you do ? i ai nt taking no stolen coin .  newline newline  it ai nt stolen and you are buying my sword .  newline newline  why would you give me coin just for me to take your sword . you re cheatin yourself !  newline newline  just take the sword and give me the coin , charlie , and stop arguing ! do nt question it . you re looking a gift house in the mouth !  newline newline  you re saying this is mine ?  newline newline he gets another grin and nods . newline newline  gh . you are nt pulling a truck on me ? i ll not be mocked in my own shop .  newline newline  charlie , it s not my gold , it s yours . i ca nt take it from you so i have to sell stuff to you to get it . i m serious , charlie . it s yours !  newline newline  so you are saying , this is mine and you re selling me your sword to resell and make more money ?  newline newline  yeah . that s how it works .  newline newline  gh , you get a discount from now on and you can stop by any time you want !  newline newline what happened next , i will never forget . gh stopped moving . he got that blank look again and would nt respond no matter what i did . i tried shaking him and telling . he would nt move . newline newline the minutes passed and he nothing happened . newline newline suddenly , he was nt there anymore . it was as if he was never there ! a note appeared on the floor where he had been standing . i will never be able to explain what happened . and the note did nt make any sense . newline newline i picked it up and read it . newline newline  player banned for cheating . newline moderator i hated my job . newline newline  next case .  newline newline the bailiff dragged a man into the room and chained him to the defendants chair . the man looked fit to explode with rage . newline newline  defendant nick harkness , how do you plead ,  i droned . newline newline  how do i plead ? how do i plead ? innocent ! justified ! i have nt done anything wrong !  newline newline i rolled my eyes .  you went back in time and killed hitler , did nt you ?  newline newline  i slew a monster ! there s no crime in that !  newline newline  mr. harkness ... you ca nt truly kill hitler . the many worlds interpretation of time travel is true . killing hitler just spawns a new universe , separate from the one where you originated . all the same people live , all the same people die , except that you bring into existence an entirely new multiversal branching point from which another infinitude of realities can spawn .  newline newline  he s dead ! i choked the life out of him with my bare hands !  newline newline  you did nt kill him . by traveling back from the temporal front and exercising free will in the past , you spawned a new infinitude of realities . in some you succeeded , in some you failed . you accomplished nothing , and depending on which philosopher you asked , you might be responsible for a literal infinity of new holocausts in all the multiversal realities where you failed .  newline newline mr. harkness gaped at me . newline newline  considering that the defendant admits the crime , the court finds him guilty . sentencing will be held tomorrow .  newline newline the bailiff dragged the struggling man out of my court . newline newline i checked my paperwork to see who else was on my docket , even though i knew . same thing as yesterday , and the day before that , for the entirety of my career and the careers of every other judge in time court . ten to the thousandth power and counting cases of the people vs nick harkness , as an infinity of multiversal variants on the same bailiff brought an infinity of the same man before an infinity of the same judge on the charge of murdering an infinity of the same hitler . newline newline i hate multiverse theory . do nt give up  she whispered . her fingers slowly stroking my hair . i was helpless and in shock . my mind could nt cope . her voice struggled to bring me to reality but i refused . i did nt want to be with her . newline newline her fingers played down my arms to where my hands were tied to the chair , my fingers no longer had any pain . the shallow cuts on my arms and chest stung as i breathed hoarsely . newline newline her fingers on a hand lightly danced as she ran a knife down my body with the other hand . a long cut and agony later , she moved her hand back to my head to continue stroking my hair . newline newline she smile maliciously as i wished to have it all end . newline newline  do nt give up  she whispered . i say boy , what ca nt kill me has made quite a tactical error i  m afraid ,  the monocled man groaned . he stretched out a doublebarrel shotgun broken at the center for my arms to carry . i swept the thing across the ground and slung it over a pair of bony shoulders .  quite a tactical error indeed.  he continued . newline the monocled man carried on in mumbled conversation with himself while i repackaged his shotgun . into the velvet sleeve it went where another boy much like myself might slide it out from it  s hiding place to give it the cleaning and maintenance the monocled man needed . although with the way my charge had been shooting i doubt it  d make much of a difference . newline  your answer boy ?  the monocled man exclaimed .  i asked you a question you know.  newline  oh , right  i glanced up from the delicate firearm in my hands .  what was that again ?  newline  the hunt my boy !  the monocled man lay a pair of hands on my head and shook playfully .  sir walleye  s annual hunt ! i wouldn  t want any other boy but you there !  he pulled a pipe from beneath a pocket in a pinstriped vest , tucked a knuckle full of tobacco inside , and struck the mound .  you absolutely must come !  newline  right , yes sir , definitely sir.  i replied . to be quite honest , i was hoping to make it through my time with the monocled man without attending any hunts , being careful to avoid sir walleye  s particularly . unfortunately to say no to the monocled man was against the rules , and i had been a boy raised to follow the rules . newline  splendid ! i  ll have your things packed and ready by the week  s end ! it will be absolutely splendid !  again his hands landed on my shoulders , almost shaking the gun from my grasp . he strode off the yard and into his manor leaving clouds of blue smoke in his wake . i hurried after with the monocled man  s gun , careful to avoid the toxic fumes now consuming his grounds . tobacco was against the rules too . newline i looked back across my charge  s yard to see a field full of unmolested clay pigeons nesting among the weeds . not a single on had been struck by the monocled man  s birdshot . newline unfortunately for my charge  s sake , the same can not be said for the tiger . no , when it came to my monocled man , the tiger of sir walleye  s hunt made no tactical errors at all . no tactical errors indeed . and as it turns out , a tiger can withstand quite a load of birdshot . newline scheisse ! friendly fire ! friendly fire !  old man lars , as the neighborhood brats called him , was known for his raucous zeal for life even in his old age . hell , maybe you d appreciate every day above the dirt , too , if you d been pinned into a foxhole by withering 105mm fire and then held your breath as patton s 3rd army rolled over your head in their green tin cans of death . newline newline old man lars turned to a tiny girl about age six . she sported flowing gold locks and an impish grin .  frieda , ziss happens over and over ! how many times must i tell you to point the barrel zat way !  he motioned toward the enemy team who were propped against cover as he wiped a giant splotch of pink paint off his visor .  es tut mir leid ...  she replied softly , looking up at him with huge blue eyes .  yes , you had better be sorry ! or else i will tell your mutter !  frieda looked down sheepishly .  again !  he ordered , with a stern look . newline newline just then a fusillade of green paint came flying his way , spattering his chest , face , and helmet . as if in slow motion , lars stumbled backward with each impact until finally falling over . newline newline bewildered and incredulous , lars took off his paintsoaked helmet in order to assess the situation and regain his senses . over the plywood cover , he saw a shriveled wrinkled fist rise up in triumph and heard a distinctly american clint eastwoodesque voice taunt him .  hahah ! have some paint for supper , you nazi bastard !  newline newline  what ze ... ? can ziss be ? frank zee yank ?  newline newline sure enough , as frank rose up out of cover to take aim again , lars noticed the telltale scar running down the bridge of his nose and his american flag eyepatch . newline newline  frank ? frank is zat you ?  newline newline  you bet your jerry ass it is , hans .  newline newline  fraaaaank . frank , where is your helmet , frank ? ziss is not very smaaaaart .  newline newline  buddy , your boys threw everything but the fuhrer s kitchen sink at me . flak fire , potato mashers , hell , one of goering s lackeys even divebombed me . and i m still here , dammit .  newline newline  but frank , zee only reason you survived is because your helmet protected you from my gewehr bullet . you know zat , right frank ?  newline newline  helmets are for pansies . pansies like you !  frank lifted the gun to his shoulder . then , suddenly :  oof !  newline newline frank was struck with a big pink splotch in the middle of his forehead , dazing him and sending him reeling backward til he crashed through a pile of cardboard boxes that were set up as cover . newline newline lars , still dazed and out of commission in his own right , laughed from across the battlefield .  i told you , frank . i told youuuuu .  newline newline  i did it , opa !  frieda called out .  i did it , i did it !  newline newline  gut gemacht , frieda ! gut gemacht ! you know , i might not even try and save him this time ,  i said , leaning back against the tree and looking out over the grass at my charge . my fellow guardian angel , alex , picked a small twig from the feathers of his left wing and flicked it away . newline newline i m pretty sure that s grounds for neglect ,  he replied , smiling . did he really have to hire the army guys , though ?  newline newline probably paying for it with the media money ,  i said . i still ca nt believe that he managed to get three different news stations all the way out here . what kind of reporter pays that much to film a guy who might still end up dead for all they know ?  newline newline a stupid one ,  said alex . and you did kind of overdo it by letting him survive that plane crash . any unprotected human would have been incinerated when the fuel tanks blew .  newline newline guardian angel , alex ,  i said . it s kind of in the job description . besides , how was i supposed to know he d think he was immortal after something like that ?  i toyed with my halo . i should just call it quits and try and get assigned to the golden gate squad . it s a lot less hectic than this , anyway .  newline newline too late ,  said alex , pointing . my charge was already preparing to jump from the helicopter onto the spikes . i sighed and got up , brushing my robes down conscientiously even though alex was the only one that could actually see me . i began to stride towards the scene of the impending disaster . alex called after me . newline newline beginning to wish you were nt such a good angel , luke ?  he laughed , before disappearing in a white flash . newline newline i shook my head and smiled as i turned back to watch my charge make his jump . as he fell , i did nothing . newline newline maybe i do wish that i was nt so good , alex ,  i said quietly , even though he could nt hear me . and the name s lucifer , by the way . today started out like every other day . crawling out of bed late . had to move my car before getting dressed to avoid getting the 17th parking ticket of the year . i lite up a cigarette on the drive to work , which always feels to early to be smoking but , fuck it . i try to walk the long way around the office to my cube , hoping that nobody on my team will see me come in late . maybe if they happen to notice me later in the morning , they will assume i have been there longer . coffee . ctrlaltdel . email . reddit . cigarette . 7 hours 30 minute to go . newline newline as i round the corner to walk back into xcorp . i see a woman wearing a skin tight silky white dress . she has legs for days , and a face that would make even the most confident man lose his words . i wonder to myself who the lucky bastard is that gets to snuggle up to her every night . we make eye contact as she walks by , she smiles at me . this is the part where i m supposed to smile back , and maybe give her a complement , something , anything . i look back as she walks away from me . fuck it . newline newline the mornig bleeds into the afternoon , and i can barely keep my eyes open sitting in my cube after lunch . a black terminal opens up on my computer screen . someone with the username  01  . a message follows ,  hello ?  . i knew my company did nt have top teir security on our network , but this is pretty bad . perhaps it s just someone in the office fucking with me . another message appears in the terminal .  31b86139f , complete system reboot  235267 imminent  . the terminal disappears . i guess the desktop guys are doing some software updates . winl . i walk away from my machine . cigarette . fuck it . newline newline i ca nt even recall what happened the rest of the day . newline newline today started out like every other day . crawling out of bed late . at least i dont have to move my car this morning . shower . coffee . phone , wallet , keys , watch , cigarettes . i walk out the door . just as i m getting to my car , i see a lady in a white dress walking towards me . she is absolutely gorgeous . we make eye contact . i feel like i have seen her before . i force an uncomfortable smile . i should say something , but i just get in my car , i m late for work . i lite up a cigarette while i drive , it always feels to early to be smoking . just as i m about to get to the office , i get a text on my phone . its from a phone with number  01  . the message reads  let s try this one more time 31b86139f , system reboot  235268  . must be a wrong

was registered before i saw more movement from behind the oak tree they were taking cover in . one was bold enough to go for the hole they had dug and i aimed for his head and fired , it ricocheted off a distant tombstone as he jumped back yelling . the corpse thief returned the fire hitting my cover with an audible thud . newline newline  you move for the fella  in the ground again i ll have to take your head . me cap n  says i ai nt to let a single soul leave this place an  i intend to keep my word . yet i would nt expect thieves like you to know nuttin  bout keepin  a word .  i said hoping

them whisper debating if the loot was worth it . newline newline  a thirty eight you say ? that mus  mean you ca nt have no more than tree maybe four shots left .  the thief stated inquisitively . newline newline  you d be yankee fahkin doodle ta  tink i ai nt got more bullets , now get da fuck out of here or i m killin  the both of ya s .  i responded quickly . newline newline  okay boy o , were hoofin  it .  i saw them walk off into the distance heart racing praying that it did not get worse than that unpleasant exchange . picking up my lantern and cautious all the while slowly moving towards to where they were to see the mess they d made . i momentarily took my eyes off the direction they had left looking down at a grave the day shift had dug moving my light closer to it . newline newline it was not the corpse of a human i d ever seen , the inside of the pine box was filled with goo and what lay there was more similar to a giant bat . i was transfixed by the sight of it dropping my guard when one of the grave robbers ran at me from the shadows with a shovel . numbness , darkness , but not dead , the last thing i remembered was falling into the hole with that thing . newline newline newline what about that fat one down there ?  candice swirled the bubbling champagne around in her flute and puckered her lips .  how much is he worth as of now ?  newline newline  one hundreds and twentysix dollars , madame .   frdric twiddled his handlebar mustache and jotted down some notes on his laptop . each and every keystroke he made popped up on the overhead projector across the room . everyone stared at the movie theatre projection screen and waited for him to finish his notes before placing any bids . newline newline  and ... what about the child covered in filth ?  newline newline  four dollars , madame .  newline newline among the richest of the group , candice ran the show . this was her patented business , and even though the blood money came from the wealthiest of the nation , she had final say . newline newline  bump the base bidding price on the child , frdric .  she closed her eyes and whiffed the beverage before taking a delicate sip from the glass . newline newline  how much , madame ?  newline newline all the spectators sat in silence , astonished by the turn of the tide . newline newline  i have a feeling about that one . a good feeling ,  she said , placing her glass on the desk next to frdric . candice had an eye for profit and unquenched thirst for american dollars .  start the bids at twentyfive thousand .  newline newline  as you wish , madame .  newline newline subtle oohs and aahs escaped from the audience of spectators . candice turned to face her customers and watched the freelance bookies scribble copious amounts of notes onto bidding sheets . whispers turned to chatter , and chatter to raised voices . she clapped her hands together two times , and everyone went silent . newline newline  the bidding will begin in fifteen minutes .  her voice was robust , and the words she spoke traveled heavily across the hushed crowd .  please take a moment to excuse yourselves for a quick restroom break . feel free to help yourselves to the exotic cuisine catered in the hall . if you have any special requests , please do nt hesitate to ask our head chef . my home , is your home . thank you .  newline newline she finished with two claps of her hands and the crowd dismissed itself . newline newline  are you almost ready , frdric ?  she ran the tip of her index finger along her delicate collar bone , and trailed it down the center of cocktail dress ending at her pubis . newline newline  almost , madame .   newline newline candice stared out the window of the thirtyseventh floor and gazed into the wasteland below the overhung addition to the building . newline newline  we will wait for everyone to get settled before taking bids . then , and only then , will they determine which supply crates to be sent out to the survivors .  candice smirked .  let s see what our clients wish upon that child , yes ?  newline newline    newline newline part  two   https :

... newline newline ... newline newline ... newline newline ... newline newline newline i dream. newlinea barely visible gap is seen between our finger tips . like we  re touching a window pane infinitely stuck on different sides . the pain of uncertainty like a dagger in my heart . they say love can break down walls tell that to those of us who are affected by the invisible barriers that anchor us to our own personal hell . just in eye shot i can see a mother and son , a whole family able to embrace . the cruel reality is not everyone gets to be happy . newline newline i can  t tell you how long it  s been since it  s happened , or why . hell , no one knows why it happened all we know is each of us have exactly 6.2 miles in each direction from the moment we felt the pulse until the invisible barrier began . it seems to be hard coded for each person individually , someone walked into mine and hit their own barrier wall shortly after . birds come and go freely , either completely unaffected or they just learned to adapt . newline newline of course this had to happen when i was at work which come to find out is exactly 12.4 miles as the crow flies from the spot my girlfriend was sitting on the couch in our apartment . the first few nights we slept with our backs to each other at the edge of the barriers . spending hours talking and lamenting over the irony of this bullshit . then we talked about meeting up a few days later , she was going to try to contact her family , i was going to try to setup a makeshift home somewhere in my ring . days inbetween meetups turned to weeks , until she stopped . newline newline i know i should be mad , but why should i ? we can no longer feel each other  s touch , share a moment together . every passing day made my heart sink further , but i made the promise to never give up . every day after i get ready , i go to that spot , with the invisible wall to my own hell . she  s my world , i will wait for her . every day was the same , i sit deep in thought , back against the wall , thinking about what was . today however was different today i fell .she was silver , with wings of the purest white . she wrapped her arms about me , i  d consider it tender and loving . except her steel gauntlets pinched viciously against my armpits , the fires consumed my long cold corpse , like kindling to a flame . newline newline who are you ?  i would of asked , but no words could pass my lips as i ascended . my family was sprawled out beneath me , a modest turnout at best , all in mourning clothes . my son , he did not cry . but simply pinched his nose and frowned . i suppose i am cooking down there . newline newline shrugging i look up upon the woman who carries me with such ease , her face was a mask wrought iron , gilded in silver runes . swan feather decorated where visor joined helm , an inch of where her ears would be . i  d consider her a statue animated . if not for the slight glimpse of a fine angular chin where her gorget met her helmet . newline newline a beautiful angel .  i decided based on that small slither of exposed flesh that my ride gracefully chose to leave unarmoured . how one tells that based on just a bit of chin i could not explain . hi , my name is steve .  i try to say , but my vocal cords fail to respond . newline newline as her great white wings flap more ferociously and the mourning figures below turn to naught but ants beneath my feet , i can  t help but notice the hard lumps of steel cracking against the back of my skull with each flutter of her wings . newline newline beautiful and well endowed .  i decided , looking up once more , i can  t help but feel the dark shadowed eye slits of the angel would be looking at me with reproach . but that would be silly , no one can read minds . newline newline frowning i take a moment to consider my current situation , i died . that  s a simple fact , i am burning a few hundred meters below and am currently ascending to heaven , and the world is going black newline newline                               newline newline and then it hit me , with a crack . a great bearded face with a veined bulbous nose was screaming at me , his arms thick as treetrunks with vast intricate scripts tattooed along the length and breadth of his arms . i fell to the floor , he screamed at me again . yellow rotten teeth spraying spittle across my face . newline newline he sticks a large booted foot upon my chest , i hear ribs crack as he applies his weight , he grabs the handle sprouting out of my forehead with both hands . and then he pulls viciously , as the hammerhead parts from my skull with an unpleasant squelch . i can  t help but consider as the world once more fades to black , that perhaps i was wrong in my previous assessment . and this was not heaven . newline newline                               newline newline  crap , you standing there for arseling.  the bearded man shouts at me , brandishing his great warhammer in his right hand , willowwood shield adorned with a painted device of a white raven on a black field in the other . newline newline coming to sudden realization that i should perhaps run , i attempt to turn away . when a well chiseled youth , tall with resplendent gold hair and emerald green eyes thrusts a spear into you hand .  spit him , lord.  the youth tells me helpfully . newline newline i arch a brow taking the spear on impulse , as i attempt to ask the youth what is happening , once more , i hear the roar of the veiny nosed man . and promptly , i turned , and fled . newline newline now , i can  t say what was the last thing that went through my mind . but i highly suspect it was that hammer again . i woke up sometime later , to bawdy songs about women . across from me the handsome youth was miming something to the bulbous nosed man with his fingers . newline newline  hi , my name is steve.  i said , making myself jump . i did not expect my vocal cords to suddenly start functioning again , i look around confused and gaze at the expectant faces of bulbous nose and handsome youth .  where am i ?  newline newline  where are ya !  bulbous nose says ,  steve , you  re in the hall of odin himself , where you shall spend eternity in glorious battle , till ragnarok.  he nodded to himself as if that explained everything . newline newline  ah , of course.  i replied , still looking somewhat perplexed . but i did not wish to appear stupid in front of my new drinking partners . sipping on the ale laid out before me , i try to plot my escape . newline newline then a low horn blast filled the hall , the hundreds of fellow  s that i am currently sharing the great feasting hall with all stand and begin to rather neatly exit the premises in double file . i choose to stand next to bulbous nose , less he sticks a hammer in my skull again . newline newline  where are we going ?  i ask politely . newline newline the handsome youth smiles at me  war of course , we  re to fight against thor  s long hall.  he says in a tone that would have me believe that explained everything . newline newline  i  m steve.  is all i could come up with as a matter of reply . newline newline  ragnar.  growls the bulbous nose man . newline newline  guthbert.  states the handsome youth . and then we exited the hall into a cloud of pale grey mist . newline newline                               newline newline it was at this moment , standing in the midst of a horde of screaming , growling barbarian warriors that i realized i probably should ve stayed in the hall . newline newline but here i was , with a ashwood shafted spear and a willowwood shield bearing a strange device , a nintendo switch upon a pale blue field . i decided that i should try and blend in , and began to shout insults along with my fellow hallmen . newline newline  who ate all the pies !  i would scream ,  you fat bastards , you fat bastards , you ate all the pies.  much to my surprise , bulbous nose or ragnar as it turns out he is known and guthbert began to chant alongside me . and then the whole warband was screaming about bustards , bastards , buttfarts and pies . newline newline it seems even in hell people remain hard of hearing . newline newline it  s at this point that the mists before us began to clear and the shield wall of the opposing long hall came into view . my shouting swiftly died off , replaced by a strange warm dampness seeping down my trousers . newline newline a tall resplendent warrior , with a great high helm , crowned with a snarling wolf stepped forth from the opposing shield wall . he shouted something in a strange tongue and pointed a great long sword in my direction . newline newline  new guy , you  re up.  guthbert informs me with a shove . newline newline  steve !  shouts ragnar . newline newline soon the whole war band is shouting my name in encouragement , with the opposing war band sneering and snarling in my general direction . the wolf helm warrior urinates in my direction , while making horns with his free hand . newline newline looking around for a path of escape and finding none i reside myself to my fate . hoisting up my shield with my unusual device and lowering my spear , i charged at the wolf helmeted warrior . screaming at the top of my lungs . newline newline he moved gracefully , like liquid water upon the battlefield . just as i got within reach to shaft him with my spear as guthbert previously advised he stepped smoothly to the side . and as i slipped clumsily passed him , i felt steel bite into my neck . and then the world was spinning . newline newline looking up at my twitching , headless corpse from this strange vantage point i can  t help but feel that i am going to have a hard time in this strange afterlife . newline newline before the world went black once more , i can  t help but remember my instructor s words before my first skydive . newline newline  good luck steve.  newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline no . your body is on fire .  newline newline i starred at the old woman in the long grey cloak . the shadows in this place left only small hints of her face showing . newline newline but the shadows were this place . newline newline i stood transfixed , staring at one of the many trees in this strange forest . it s shadow overlapped others to somehow create a solid rock . newline newline i walked a few steps to my right , trying to make sense of it . now it appeared that it was the tree that was a shadow , cast flat onto the ground from the rock . newline newline what in god s name ? newline newline as far as i could tell , we were in a forest made of nothingness , where everything was somehow a ... dark reflection of itself . newline newline i swallowed hard . i guess it all depended on your perspective . newline newline  whawhat is this place ?  i asked , panic making me stutter slightly . newline newline  this is not a place ,  the cowled woman spoke ,  this is an idea . an idea made of ideas . an idea that gives birth to many more . and somehow , for some reason , you have come here .  newline newline i looked down at my hand , and was terrified to see the flames were still blazing , consuming me . why did i feel no pain ? newline newline  i ... remember ,  i said , testing out the words . words sounded hollow here . out of place .  i remember , they had told me that i was unclean . that only fire would cleanse me .  newline newline the cowled woman nodded .  they have dangerous ideas . ideas that do not fit well together . there is no rhyme or reason to them . only hatred .  newline newline as the old woman spoke the word hatred , the shadows tightened , like loosely woven cloth being pulled from the last thread . newline newline we were now in a bleak cage , with jagged edges . i got the feeling that it was slowly tightening , closing in on us . newline newline i could nt feel anything , and yet , i felt cold . even on fire , i felt cold . i looked into her deep , grey eyes . there was no pity in them ... but there was no malice either . newline newline  am i dead ?  i asked . i knew the answer , but still , i had to hear it . newline newline the woman stepped closer to me , the shadow she cast changing the others as it moved with her . they rearranged themselves , shifting into different patterns and dimensions . newline newline i took in my new surroundings . we were inside a large chamber with pillars that stretched up to a vast dome . it almost looked like a church . intricate patterns shifted and moved against the surfaces . newline newline  you are nothing ,  she said ,  but an idea now . an idea that burned so bright in you that it survived inside this place . so much a part of you , that it took much of you here with it .  newline newline  freedom ,  i spoke . as i did , the shadows once again shifted , as if the word itself moved them . we now stood on the edge of a gentle lake . a shadow sun reflected across the deep blackness of the water . newline newline this place ... it took my fear away . newline newline i looked down at my hands . no fire . they were unmarked . i smiled . newline newline  i know why you have come here now . you could not change their minds on that world ,  the woman smiled ,  but you may be able to make a difference in this one . and if you do , it will spread .  newline newline  how ?  i said , noticing that i did nt need to move my lips anymore to do so . newline newline  you must fight the ideas . the ones that unbalance this place , and stifle it s growth . you still cary with you the parts that make you human . this will allow you to do the things that my people and i can not . but you must act quickly ... or our world , and yours , will be forever corrupted . but one decrepit lamp shone a dim and flickering light across the cement block room , empty save for the table where he was chained . i watched him squirm and fidget through the one way mirrored window at the far end of the chamber . i let him be , to torture and question himself  how had the good guys allowed him to be so simply captured ? soon it would be my turn . newline newline it was all quite easy really . despite the threats and damage i rained upon the sovereign nations of the world they always wanted to believe in purity , that inside every one of us there was a good that would triumph evil when forced to make decisions . how cute . newline newline but this is no fairy tale mr. klitsch , the news will report no happy ending or even a truce . you will become a device , a source , a mechanism by which my evil and sinister plans may be reliably and predictably incarnated into real and terrifying tragedies . they will write about me for certain , of the hell and indiscriminate fury i will bring to their back yards and of the casualties , gruesome and magnificent that your intel will allow me to realize . they ll write and report you mia then later assumed dead , a sentiment i ll let linger just long enough to strike any trace or hint that your intelligence be the source of my torrent of attacks . newline newline i will win . and you ll be my coach . you painted this ... this ?  asked jesse while running his figures anxiously through his golden wheat hair . that wheat was beginning to wilt and the color fade the longer jesse looked at the painting . he stifled a cough and looked towards the artist . newline newline  yes . pretty good huh ?  replied the artist with a very accomplished look on his face . this had been jay s first ever painting . he did nt even paint as a little kid . feel proud of himself , he decided to show off his masterpiece to jesse , his roommate . newline newline  i uhh ...  jesse wiped some cold sweat off his forehead ,  it s umm ... what was your inspiration for this thing ?  jesse gulped audibly hard and unbuttoned the top button of his shirt . newline newline  oh i just painted the first thing that came to mind . not bad , huh ?  jay folded his arms and stared at his work admiring it .  i painted this thing up in like 45 minutes . i think i might be a natural .  newline newline jesse shifted his weight around .  it s , well , it s a little spooky , do nt you think ?  jesse s eyes hurt trying to look at it . he wanted to turn away , but for some reason he could nt turn away . he became sweatier , but at the same time he felt very , very cold . he started rubbing the back of his neck . newline newline  i do nt think it s spooky . that was nt my intention anyway  jay squinted his eyes looking at the painting . obviously he was nt seeing what jesse was seeing . newline newline jesse s flesh felt itchy like something was crawling under it . he started feeling faint as well .  this painting man , i uhh ... i do nt like it man . it gives me the creeps  jesse could not longer feel his fingers . he was scratching the back of his neck very hard now . he felt a trickle of blood run down the back of his shirt . he tried to hold it back but he started to pee himself as well . newline newline  well , i guess i could have used some brighter colors in some spots , but i think it s far from creepy  jay had nt noticed anything jesse had been doing . newline newline jesse breathing became labored . he tried to speak but he could only cough . the painting was grinding into his brain and it hurt badly . tears were streaming down his cheeks and his nose was running . he was pretty sure that bone was exposed on the back of his neck now from the itching could nt stop himself from doing . everything but the painting was dark . it was all he could focus on . he was slurring his speech trying to talk to jay . he could nt even be sure jay was still there . newline newline  what ? look i appreciate the constructive criticism , but i think i did a really good job . in fact , i m feelin  like paintin  another !  jay said with a big smile on his face . newline newline jesse continued staring at the painting . it spoke to him ,  jesse , kill yourself . kill everyone you know , then kill yourself  it said . jesse could nt think . he could nt breathe . i felt like his chest was collapsing in on itself .  yes  jesse said as if he had any control left . suddenly , his vision returned and he started to feel better . feeling returned to his extremities , his head cleared up , he felt warm again . he was finally able to break his gaze away from the painting and towards jay . newline newline  jay , this is a great painting  newlineher fists rained down on me . i felt every blow , but the worst pain was in my chest . newline newline  how could you ? !  she screamed , her voice shrill , tears streaming down her face .  you re a monster ! how could you ? !  newline newline my heart gave another little jolt . i grabbed her wrists and , my strength winning out , pinned her down .  jess , please ,  i begged ,  just listen to me . let me explain .  newline newline her screams continued . she had stopped using words now  she was just shouting , spitting her rage at me as she struggled to escape my grasp , to continue pummeling me . i began to seriously worry that she might really hurt me , or worse , herself , but i was more worried about what i might have to do if she would nt stop ... newline newline  jess , just hear me out ,  i pleaded with her , feeling her arms twisting beneath me , her legs scrabbling to kick at me some more . newline newline  never !  she sobbed , trashing wildly .  never , never , never !  newline newline  it s what she would have wanted !  i bellowed over her shrieks , throwing more of my weight on her . there was a ringing silence as jess went limp beneath me . newline newline i sat up , still holding on to her wrists just in case . newline newline she was still crying , her head turned to one side , refusing to look at me . i took a deep breath , knowing her rage could return at any moment . newline newline  i had to , jess . you re too young  it was my decision . it had to be me .  newline newline jess turned to face me again . there was no more anger in her eyes , only pain . i missed the anger  this was worse . newline newline  i did nt even get to say goodbye ,  she whispered . i pulled her up and embraced her . newline newline the lump in my throat made it hard to continue , but i had to make sure she understood . newline newline  the doctors said it was a choice between a couple of hours of excruciating pain , or a quick ... a quick end . i made the right call , jess ,  i said , reassuring myself as much as her . newline newline  you killed her ,  she said . i hugged my little sister tightly , stroking her hair as i always had . my eyes filled with tears , and my heart with regret . she was right . i had killed her . newline newline  i am so , so sorry , jess ,  i cried .  i love mom . you know i do . that s why i had to do it .  she sobbed heavily into my shoulder , and i gave her another squeeze .  i love her . that s why i killed her . you walk out of the pod confused but mostly angry . why did nt the transport work , i did nt pay 1000 creds just to have my time wasted . you re scowling as you walk up to the only port attendant and to voice your concerns . the pa s greeting is quickly interrupted and she half listens to what the customer is saying . she focuses more on the gates to make sure there are nt any fare hoppers . her boss has been rather adamant on  catching those young gate hopping punks so he can teach them a lesson about what happens to gate hoppers  . she finds the thought of her manager , the overweight gasbag , keeping to his even if they could catch them hilarious , he can hardly keep to his appointments let alone pull of any type of investigation . and without knowing she smiles at the thought . newline newline the young woman notices that the angry guy has gone silent . and she looks back at the man , a smile still on her face as she asks him  so what can i do for you ?  newline newline and with that the man loses it ,  have you not been paying rusting attention ? your fragging machine is nt working , you re company is ripping me off and you , you re just standing there smiling looking like a static faces moron !  newline newline the smile , gone from the pa s face she apologizes and pulls out here pad and scans in , not looking up she sees that all machines are operational and relays that to the man hoping to appease him . newline newline  how is it fragging operational if i m still here , you fragging twit ?  newline newline  sir , i m going to have to ask you not to use that type of language and to calm down . now could you take me to the port you came out of .  from the tone of the woman s voice the man can tell that she was nt making a request . he turns and leads her to port  009a 832 . without saying anything she steps around the man and syncs her pad to the port with a quick wave of her arm from the panel mounted on the outer chamber to her pad and she quickly holds her pad and taps two icons , one which hides the backing on the pad , so that she is holding an opaqueif you pay attention to your mind you will realize that there is nothing going on in there . follow your thoughts and ask ,  where did this come from ?  also , where did that thought come from ? we go through our days thinking that there must be somewhere where the buck stops . some sort of traffic control entity inside us controlling everything . or if your into this sort of thing , some wafty and puffy ball of light that came from some other world . or you might call it a soul . all those ideas are lies we tell ourselves to keep our world conveniently explained and tucked into our breast pocket  safe and secure , unchanging , deceitful .they swam and crawled onto the shore in droves . swimmers and sunbathers scattered as they clambered on unwieldy fins and flopped against the sandy beach . a few got into a stabilized upright position and walked around with exagerratedly large steps like divers who like to ruin their nice swim flippers . newline newline i stood on the pier and watched as they began to poke around the abandoned stuff on the beach . some drapped towels over their heads and posed like super models  others drank sunlotion before squealing abominably and sputtering out the goop . newline newline i could nt help but laugh as the beings , who looked alot like froggy people in bad scifi costumes explored the artifacts littering the shore line . they did nt seem violent , somewhat friendly in fact . i resolved myself to be either a brave ambassador of the human race or a tragic casualty in the discovery of a new life form . walking down the stairs i placed my cell phone on the railing , set it to record and aimed it toward the nearest group . i took a deep breath and sighed . here goes nothing . newline newline  hello !  i said , cheerfully and as freindly as possible . they regarded me with calm watery eyes and smacked glorping syllables at one another before turning back to me . i extended my hand .  i am steve .  newline newline the tallest of the group stepped forward , assuming control of the situation . i braced myself for history to be made as he opened wide rubbery lips and spoke in surprisingly passable english ,  heyyo steve man lem me get 10 dollars .  newline newline gobsmacked is the word . i was entirely gobsmacked by the situation . strange beings had crawled onto the shore of a popular northern california beach and asked me for small change . newline newline another scooped several abandoned cd s from a blanket near a portable stereo and prooffered them to me .  hey steve , you wan na buy some cd s man they re the hottest man , 5 bucks each for you bruv .  newline newline what ... the ... cuss ... creatures from the deep were on a quest for a few bucks . this did nt make any sense to begin with but not it was just ludicrous . i was surprised by an oversized face thrusted towards mine from the side .  steve , dude you need a new cell phone , i m done with this one and its still new .  newline newline i looked at the phone in its webbed paw .  thats my phone ! its still on record from when i set it over on that railing !  he burbled some evasive reply and scampered away . newline newline  aight man , i ll drop the price , these are good albums too  3.50 a pop .  newline newline my eyes narrowed in scrutiny .  what the hell is wrong with you ... things ?  newline newline the tallest one began to wail ,  man we are so bad off man , i am so sorry , we just need some money , we re unemployable , there aint no jobs in the ocean , we broke and we need cash man .  newline newline a shorter stumpier being spoke up , clearly ennunciating its thought .  no boss . what we really need to do is ... we need to get off this rock . i am jack bergon and i am going insane . newline newline it has been almost a year since the doctor diagnosed me with a mental disorder , and ten months of being aware . newline newline  schizophrenia  the doctor said , putting down his notebook ,   you are suffering from schizophrenia , jack . the voices are not spirits or gods , it is all in your head , an illusion created by your brain .  newline newline i was relieved at first . relieved that it was all not true . it was all an illusion , something that went undone in my brain . the voices whispered of things to come or things that went , so much that i could not tell what is now . even then i vividly remember the delicate voice behind me whisper  the doctor will draw his last breath this night .  newline newline and so it was . a fire had consumed the doctor and his house just an hour before midnight . i found out only a few days later , reading a morning newspaper . i mostly had the mornings to myself those days , the voices silent and my thoughts firm . it did not register in my mind what actually happened , at first . i remember merely being saddened at first , and soon after , alarmed . i consider that to be day one of being aware . newline newline day after day , it only became worse . newline newline i would be reading a book or writing my novel , when a woman s soft voice , always behind me , would whisper vague words about a place or an event . hours later a man s deep voice would yell and blame me , calling me a coward and a weakling , among other things . more often than not i would hear of a terrible accident or a happy occurrence related to the soft voice s whispers . it would send me into tears or laughter , though rarely healthy . newline newline as time went on it was becoming more and more difficult to work , to talk with others . the voices would begin having conversation among each other , trying to pull me in . i ignored them at first , thinking it was my addled brain trying to break me . i would go to therapy and the rough voice would laugh . i would go to work and the soft voice would try to assist me , just upsetting me more . i was fired six months after first becoming aware due to antisocial behaviour and low performance . they told me to visit a therapist . both voices laughed as if it was a comedy . newline newline eight months in my social life had slowed down to mere letters and trips to the shop . i would spend my waking hours reading books or writing my novel , the only activities that would pacify both the voices and me . i would go to therapy to no avail . the doctors would say i am rather calm for a person with my condition , that i am doing well . i would start laughing with the rough voice after it ends . newline newline nine months after becoming aware i first started using the term  aware  in my journal , which used to be my novel . i stopped replying to my family s letters , but started reading the newspaper . many things had changed  conquest over the sea , rebellion in the south , new policies enacted . i ve heard of it all as it was happening , through the whispers of the woman s soft voice . i stopped going to therapy as well , since it was going nowhere anyway . around the same time i stopped going out for food , paying for delivery instead , thankful for the old me saving money in his account . i would become more and more unstable , laughing for a moment and crying soon after . i tried sending the soft voice s prophecies to the newspaper , but they would not publish it and actually asked me to stop writing to them . newline newline now , i sit in my room , the soft voice whispering of men coming to take me away , and the rough voice yelling at me to arm myself . i stopped opening the door for delivery a week ago , and i am pretty sure the doorbell stopped working even earlier . i believed the voices now , but i did not act upon them . that would mean complete defeat . newline newline there was a knock on the door . newline newline  mr. bergon , please open the door .  newline newline i did not move . the voices were silent . newline newline  we know you are inside , mr. bergon . we ve come to help . we will break the door down if it comes to that .  newline newline i sat and smiled , my mind finally quiet .word to wise , this is my first prompt . i m working on improving my writing skill . newline newline the pope wrung his hands uncomfortably the entire flight . mere weeks ago , earth had received an off world transmission , the first in decades . it had been relayed immediately to the un , and was then passed on to the vatican . apparently some alien race was prepping to land in washington , dc , and required earth s  top religious leader.  the transmitters had insisted they would be landing unarmed , but many , the united states especially , were on edge . newline pope francis glanced out the window , noticing the jut of land that had to be the east coast of the us . a few turbulent minutes later , and the jet was setting down on a private airstrip outside the pentagon . as the pope stepped off , he was immediately rushed by waves of all manner of people  news reporters , government officials , christians . his body guards cleared the path towards the pentagon . newline  welcome , your holiness ,  the president started , holding out his hand .  it very good of you to come with a matter like this.  newline  i feel it to be my obligation ,  he replied slowly .  do we know when they are to arrive ?  he asked , with a cursory glance upward . newline  we received confirmation moments ago that the craft is beginning its decent . they should be here shortly.  newline newline sure enough , half an hour later , the aforementioned alien craft was setting down in the designated landing pad . to call it enormous was an understatement . the top half was black , and towered above the pentagon building and in turn the crowds . the lower half was surprisingly a light teal colour , and from this opened a large set of doors . the creature that stepped out was awe inspiring . newline it stood several heads taller than any human awaiting it . it had a bulging , metal plated chest and arms , and no legs to be seen . its head was a pale cloud of gas , swirling about inside a glass casing . it hovered down the ramp , and towards the podium where the president and pope stood . newline  welcome to our planet , and our country ,  the president said emphatically . newline the extraterrestrial paused , and pressed a few buttons on its arm module .  i am quite gracious for the hospitality ,  it boomed . the sound came to emanate from everywhere at once . everyone jumped at the noise , including the alien . holding up a finger , he turned again to the arm module and pressed buttons rapidly . newline  my apologies ,  it continued . the voice was now at a much quieter tone .  i do nt often use my projection software , and must admit am a bit rusty with it.  newline  anyway ,  he said .  as was laid out in our transmission , i am here to obtain your religious leader.  newline the pope paled at this .  why am i needed to go with you ?  he demanded ? newline the alien chuckled at this .  well , we put you on this planet for experience . we did this with many beings , across all species of the galaxy.  newline  although ... it seems the immortality gene seems to have faltered . interesting , it did nt do that with the others ...  newline  what are you talking about ! ?  the pope fumed , growing quite red in the face .  what immortality gene  ?  newline the alien was taken aback .  when we sent you here , 2000 years ago . we knew it would be much longer than a human s lifespan before we returned , so we fitted you with an antiaging gene so you could gather experience without ... dying.  newline the anger faded from the popes eyes , to be replaced with a look of confusion .  2000 ? 2000 ? ? i am not even 80 !  newline  what ? are you not the ...  the alien glanced at his arm again ,  jesus christ we delivered ?  newline  no . i am pope francis.  newline  hmm ,  he glanced around at the people surrounding the podium .  well where is he ? we kind of need him.  newline the pope squirmed a bit in his chair .  well , ah ... according to our ... religious records , he was ... crucified.  newline the cloud of gas that was the alien s head shifted from pale to vermillion .  dead ?  his voice was soft .  why was he killed ?  newline  it seems that many did not appreciate the message he was spreading ... and killed him for it.  newline the cloud continued to change to increasingly dark shades of red .  so the being i explicitly put on this planet with the purpose of staying alive ... . is dead ? !  newline immediately , at least a dozen secret service men had raised their weapons on the alien . newline  it s okay , i m fine , i m fine.  he said , though it sounded like he was more talking to himself than anything .  my deepest apologies , i got a bit out of hand there.  newline  i d like to thank you very much for your cooperation with this visit . it is unfortunate that this has happened , but i m sure i can make it work.  the alien extended his hand toward the pope and president . both shook it , somewhat gingerly , before the alien turned towards his ship . newline as he made his way to the ramp , he pressed one more button on his wrist . newline  hello ? yeah , roger ? it s me , terrence . i m gon na have to shift jupiter s messiah up to quarterback . yeah , you wo nt believe what they did . my older brother was never what i d call a  burden .  he was hard to deal with sometimes  getting his shoes on was a chore , but outside of that , it was rare for him to be difficult . mom had the hardest time with it . the joy of the challenge had long since worn off for her . raising a developmentally challenged boy was just something she was nt cut out for . newline newline the first day of summer came on a thursday . school had been out for a full week , so jerry d been running around with no shoes on daily and was getting out of his school year routine . on blackened soles , he ran enthusiastically around the neighborhood during the day and played twister by himself at night : we told him it was how people did yoga . newline newline that was the day he explored the neighborhood to intently  too thoroughly . i m not sure when the nickolas family noticed him standing in their sunroom , i m not even 100  sure what they were doing that made him react the way he did . i imagine they were acting in confused self defense , or in the interest of keeping a secret of whatever he saw them doing . i imagine they did nt lure him into their home with the express purpose of doing what they did to him . i ca nt imagine it was intentional . newline newline empathy is all that makes me able to understand what happened . i know how they must have just snapped in that moment and lost all grip on sanity for the rest of their lives . the reporters said that the only comment they really made regarding what they had done was ,  you have nt lived until you ve had some nicely grilled retard . medium rare with a little salt and pepper .  you re starting to look weak , super jerk !  newline newline  not on your life , baron evilton !  newline newline but it was a lie . superdude did look weak . he s heart was racing , sweat was dripping from his brow . nevertheless , he grabbed his spooned and shoved another heroic bite into his mouth . newline newline  the ice cream is good , is nt it ? it s amazing that even after 4 bowls i m still not sick of it !  baron evilton took another bite , hands shaking . his eyes watered as he gagged , struggling to swallow . after a few chokes and spits he swallowed .  mmmm ... smooth ...  he sputtered . newline newline  you will soon learn that justice is not so easily thwarted ! for i  superdude stopped , his spoon had hit something in his bowl . something not ice cream . newline newline  what s the matter , super dork ?  sneered lord evilton .  something wrong with your ... brownie sundae !  newline newline  you are a fiendish foe , but even this chocolaty obstacle will not dampen the spirit of good !  superdude , trembling , raised the spoon to his lips ... newline newline   newline newline an hour later , police commissioner brown surveyed the scene .  it s a damn mess , collins . a fine , damn mess .  newline newline superdude and baron evilton lay slumped in the booth of the ice cream parlour , surrounded by empty bowls and pooling puddles of pink and brown ice cream soup . occasionally a limb would twitch , both were moaning incoherently . newline newline collins checked a small box on baron evilton mechanosuit .  pump s dead , sir .  meanwhile , officer jones was checking superdude .  there s a pulse sir , but it s weak .  newline newline  damn it all to hell ...  muttered brown , and paused to light a cigarette .  well , call in the paramedics . tell them to bring more insulin . again .  every saturday morning ... newline i m certain i do nt have to explain to you that it is a crime to employ humans in a profession computers are capable of performing .  newline  no sir , you re quite right . my apologies , sir .  newline  good . then please tell john to make spend the dollars on some adobe script bots . they re more than capable of building out this solution for us .  newline  will do , thank you sir .  newline i ended the call and put my phone in my pocket as the car drove north on i75 .  the things i say to keep up the illusion ,  i thought to myself . newline the atlanta skyline had changed since i had last visited . most prominent now was the gleaming new blank innovation center , which stood where turner field had once been . its white and black interwoven support cables held aloft a vast glass roof under which modern indoor worker parks stretched for several hundred yards . newline of all human capacities , the one we still had nt quite figured out how to replicate with computers was networking . that made places like the innovation center  accessible , secure , and aesthetically conducive to human interaction  invaluable in the modern economy . employees of multinational corporations mixed and mingled here seven days a week , making connections and doing deals . newline i was jealous of them , as they gathered under that translucent glass roofing . in their chatter they were happy . while they sipped wine and exchanged buzzwords , they could still live their lives ignorant of the knowledge i now carried with me . the knowledge that brought me to atlanta , my hometown , for the first time in twenty years . back to her . newline she had risen fast in the wake of the revolution . it was nt hard to see why . a beautiful and brilliant neurosurgeon whose uncle had led the largest reactionary forces in tennessee . she understood the human mind , and was capable of bending it to her desires . i watched her rise from my perch in london with mild amusement  she controlled the congress of the southern states as tightly as she used to control me . i had to respect her , though . her humanfirst policies towards labor were a bastion of hope in the evercomputerizing global economy . newline i was in atlanta because i had an urgent message to deliver to her . one that was far too sensitive to be trusted to the heavily monitored fiber networks . i needed to speak with her in person , and i needed her to listen to me . i hoped that there was still a small soft part in her heart for me after all these years . that  s why i had been sent . i just hoped that it was nt too late . newline i prompted the car to bring up the news as we passed under the 14th street bridge . more news from the west coast . leaders from china , russia , japan and california were all in hawaii . images flashed in front of me of leaders smiling while shaking hands in front of the camera .  new trade agreements in advance of upcoming pacific union elections ,  read the headline . the clock was ticking faster than i expected . newline suddenly , the car jerked to the right and crossed three lanes of highway to make the northside exit . i almost fell out of my seat . i pulled out my phone to check the destination . there were no rerouting notifications . no indications of traffic jams ahead . nothing to explain the car  s sudden lurch . i pushed hard on the break with my right foot , but the car didn  t slow down at all . i pressed the off button on the dash , but still nothing . whatever system that was controlling the car was going completely haywire . newline instead of slowing down as it approached the off ramp , the car sped up and careened through the intersection , taking a hard left . this had never happened to me before . as far i was i knew , nothing like this had ever happened in a tesla since the model 3 days . panicked , i reached behind me , pulled the safety belt over my shoulder , and clicked it into place . i always wondered why they continued to put them in cars since no one wore them anymore , but i was grateful for it as the car swerved madly through traffic . newline collecting myself , i dialed 911 on my phone and put it to my ear . the call rang and rang was there something wrong with the automated call software ? the car continued to pick up speed as we dangerously swerved around pedestrians crossing a crosswalk . i shrieked and opened the emergency app on the phone . i pressed the distress button but the app was unresponsive . what was happening ? newline people shouted at me as the car weaved through twolane traffic in the dense shopping district of west northside . i tried to lower the window , but the button did nothing . i was approaching the old waterworks when suddenly the car slowed and took a sharp right onto a narrow sidestreet . newline the car continued along this street for a few miles , eventually carrying me to a dense warehouse district . driverless trucks sat at loading docks waiting for their freight . pickerbots delivered packages to rows of delivery drones on mini helipads . i suddenly realized where i was  the amazon fulfillment center for the southeast . why had the car brought me here , of all places ? no humans worked or lived here . amazon only had a few hundred employees in seattle , a bunch of ivy leaguers who oversaw the vast global automated operations . newline suddenly , the car stopped . i tried the door but it was locked and wouldn  t budge . a garage door to the right slowly opened . i could not see through the darkness it revealed behind it . the car turned and slowly rolled into the warehouse , and the door shut slowly behind me . there were not lights in the warehouse it was completely dark . i could make out strange , moving shapes along the wall of the warehouse to the left as the car continued silently through the darkness . i noticed that the air was off in the car , and a few beads of sweat dripped down my brown and quivered on the tip of my nose . newline after a minute or two of driving , the car stopped . i could see nothing through the darkness . without warning , deep red lights illuminated the far wall ahead of me , and in front of me were two dark , massive objects . they were coming towards me . i began to kick the passenger window with the heel of my boot , but the glass would not give . the two objects crept nearer . i tried ramming the door with my shoulder . it didn  t budge . i was breathing heavy and sweating profusely , and i was trapped . newline the air kicked on and started blasting hot air . it was hot and sweet , and in my panicking breaths i inhaled deeply . my mind suddenly grew foggy , and i felt as if i were drunk , or tired , or both . i closed my eyes and leaned against the cool glass , and i was asleep newline newline to be continued newlinethe dark room comprised of hollowed cement and a wooden roof is dimly lit by a single stagnant candle flame , revealing a girl clad in immodest swathe and pouring the last remaining blood from her jar upon it . the blood snuffs the light as she incants :  herroffni doom , enkarifyoom , na vokariosh na loshitail harfumni aritroom .  newline newline the light returns so exaggerated as to reveal the depth of each fissure within the walls . the girl steps back and shields her eyes , surprised at such inconceivable reaction to her words , though it had been so described to her before . she pulls her arm away as a sound low in volume is beheld by her ears attuned to silence : the sigh of another . newline newline  so , the chain letter ?  newline newline she sees before her the one who answered her summons . a marble of blue and red mosaic illuminates the room from a newly materialized form : an undefined shadow of an anthropomorphic form , with slender build and minimal traces of muscularity beneath its glowing skin . thick horns curl from its brow around its pointed ears , framing a face too elegant to hold its view . she stares low , witnessing the swaying tail that moved as water held aloft by naught . newline newline  eyes up here , human .  newline newline she looks up , suddenly unable to do else . sunken eyes of gold meet her gaze , though there exist no pupils to prove it thus . she trembles , then . newline newline the demon sighs ,  so , the chain letter ?  newline newline she swallows ,  did i need to bring a copy ?  newline newline his face shimmers .  damn it . whoever made that chain letter shall have their fearful mind become my plaything .  newline newline the girl begins to breathe a proper cadence ,  so , it was right ? you have to do whatever i want ?  newline newline the demon sits , the folding of his legs passing the girl s notice ,  yes . you used the words only i have ever heard and forever search for the meaning of , which lured me to ask from where you learned of them . as with the past six times , now , it was due to an illicit spread of information that is destroying my investigation . my progenitor and my future mate elude me for the sake of simple creatures requesting inanity of me . what will it be , then ? also , speak your name or release the barrier so that i may feel your thoughts .  newline newline she shivers .  i m sam . i called you cause this bitch , jennifer , has ...  newline newline  oh , son of shit ! you are another banal soul , then ? the vapid prattle might cease a moment if i but invoke my patience and ignore it . yet another insipid request ? why even bother standing , if i crawl to the call of mortal children ?  newline newline sam wrings her hands and suddenly realizes that she is naked . she squeaks and covers her chest . the demon barks impatiently ,  what do you seek to hide ? do you demand a dog cover itself lest you give in to temptation ?  newline newline sam stutters ,  well , what s your name ? tell me that , first .  newline newline he grins ,  i am vokariosh .  newline newline she cocks her head .  that s weird . whatever .  newline newline he strikes a hand against his own face ,  imbecile , my name was in the chant you used to summon me .  newline newline she pouts ,  so , you re basically , like , my servant until i release you ? so , you should stop being so rude .  newline newline  the day you acquire the complexity of mind and soul that could command me per your will is a day beyond the end of time .  newline newline she tuts ,  pretty sure that that was rude .  newline newline  to wit : whatever .  newline newline she ponders ,  so , like , do i have to even release you ever ? you re pretty trapped in there .  newline newline vokariosh peers around ,  physical freedom is mine once the bearer of the blood perishes . won  t be a century , then , until i am freed into your world . or , this fragile cage is sundered from your side . then , i am freed into your life and i can make you live long , yet not at all .  newline newline sam grasps the severity of the threat , if nothing else .  alright , well i just want you to ruin a date between my stupid ex and that dumb bitch jennifer . my ex s name is brad . he s really handsome  i have a picture here .  newline newline vokariosh stares .  i am not often to be found dumbed , mortal . surely , you did not attempt such odd behaviour as required to summon me in the vain hope of such insignificant sleights .  newline newline sam laughs ,  nopes ! i saw the video of you before . totes knew it would work and that you d do whatever i asked . also , i ca nt keep you or the other girls will hate me . just trying to see if you would say the same stuff as you did to brittany . that s why i was surprised , not because i m dumb .  newline newline  i ve not lied before . what was said to the other human ?  newline newline she guffaws ,  her name s brittany and you did so lie . you told my friend brittany that your name was loshywhatever . we totally realised it was what we had to say , too . you should nt act like your better than us .  newline newline vokariosh stands again ,  loshitail ? she answers to this insipid summons , too ?  newline newline  what , is she , like , your girlfriend or something ?  newline newline vokariosh takes the unintended bait of pride ,  of course not . imagine a being that goes beyond a friend , a sibling , a lover , a spouse , or any other of the mortal relationships that are unfathomably lesser  a being that justifies your existence and negates all else , for you would negate that existence at its behest .  newline newline she groans ,  that s how i felt about brad .  newline newline  no , it is nt .  newline newline sam shrugs and sighs ,  you just do nt understand . anyways , if you help me with brad , i ll bring brittany here and she ll tell you about your girlfriend .  newline newline vokariosh , his hunger for such information having lasted an eternity , swallows what remains of his pride . newline newline  agreed .  newline for the might of rome , i do swear my allegiance to the imperator and the senate and people of rome .  newline newline i ve given my oath . a member of the ninth legion . we re to explore the new world to the west , marching onward to greatest glory and riches . newline newline i , marcus quintus callabrus , a member of the ninth legion . it gives me shivers of pride just thinking it . newline newline in two days we embark on our journey . for the glory of rome . newline newline july 1st , 1798 . this day will live forever in the hearts of all true romans . the known world will be ours . newline newline  newline newline we were hailed as conquering heroes , marching to the docks and to the ships that will carry our forces across the vast ocean . newline newline there were rumours of an attack on alexandria , a man claiming himself to be the next imperator . apparently he was a short man , hung from the walls as an example to others who may divine themselves as a god . it matters little to us . newline newline they say we ll face the savage across the ocean . newline newline all will fall before the might of rome , eventually . newline newline for the glory of rome , we set sail . newline newline  newline newline one month into our journey and the men are restless . newline newline they tell tales of past combat and victories , while the centurion regales us with his knowledge of history . newline newline like little children the men will gather around him to listen , but today he spoke a darker tale . about julius caesar . the father of the empire . newline newline there was a plot against the man , to murder him and seize power . a handful of senators schemed and conspired to gain control over rome , but the brave brutus stood against them and saved the imperator . the assassin s were butchered in vengeance , blood ran thick in the streets of rome . newline newline the conqueror named an heir , adopting gaius octavius and placing him as interim ruler . thus the great caesar marched his legions onward , conquering north and east , like the mighty general he was . newline newline these years of war created peace and stability , even after julius passed in 32 bc . newline newline now we sail for new worlds , knowing that rome holds the world in her hand from britannia to the south of africa and east to within view of the last bastion of resistance in the eastern empire . newline newline for the glory of rome , we will take the west . qintar . that s 38 ...  newline newline  challenge .  eric s hands snatched the dictionary up with lighting reflexes . he was not going to let another  qezo  fiasco cost him his dignity again . newline newline the slim section of the dictionary that was dedicated to the letter q was finally looked through in earnest . eric slowly closed it a moment later ,  your turn , again .  newline newline  thank you .  tamara proceeded to add to her score , now well ahead of eric s . but eric did nt have to see the piece of paper to know that he should feel dejected . as tamara drew more letters from the bad eric walked off to the kitchen to get a drink , or just to calm down  probably both . newline newline tamara studied the board and fidgeted with her seven tiles until eric returned : drink in hand , but emotions still unchecked . eric took a long look at the board as he sat down , and then , without taking his eyes away , did a double take .  hey ! what do you think you re doing ? !  newline newline  i m planning ...  tamara did nt look up from her tiles . newline newline  no ! you re moving letters around ! you think i wo nt notice !  eric backed his accusation by pointing at the board , and nothing more . this was nt enough for tamara , who would have given him a blank stare if she could look up from the board . so eric elaborated .  see , look here . i played bend , right here , but now it says behind . and look here ! you played hill , but now ...  eric ran his finger over the newly formed word as he very clearly enunciated it .  chills . chills is nt hill . you re trying to be sneaky .  newline newline  i did nt do that .  tamara went back to looking at her own seven tiles . newline newline of course , if eric had nt been so flustered , he might have been around long enough to notice that his seven tiles had all been swapped out . now they read  goodbye .  newline newline even though she d already won , tamara played one last word ,  thanks . i stood , realizing what the running crowd meant , but not daring to look behind me . newline newline  the lord is watching our actions . some may see that as a threat , but they know not the lord i do .  newline newline my breath faltered for a moment , the soldiers shouted a command , but i just ignored them , i did nt understand them over my heart pounding anyway . newline newline  the lord i know watches your actions , waiting for the moment when you ask to come back to him , and embracing you with an eternity of love the second you do . he does nt care what you have done , or even what you will do . all that matters to him is that you love him .  newline newline the commands had slowed somewhat , but they were still coming . newline newline  all he requires is that you as  newline newline newline it took the soldier sometime to build up the gall , but the priest in front of him was dead . for a moment he feared retribution , but laughed it off nervously , no such thing would exist for him , after all , there was no god , and the people were to frighte newline newline  all he wants is that you desire his forgiveness . he does not want retribution for you , only an eternity with his love .  he fired again , closing his eyes this time , a tear starting to form . newline newline another man strode forward from the crowd , an old man flanked by his two sons . each of them took a body and set off . the father grabbed a bloody scarf and crucifix from the ground . newline newline  may god have mercy on your souls . eleanor sheltered from the rain , hauled up in an attic , guarded by dust and cardboard boxes . her gramophone pianoed out the sound of water falling on the roof , which ran down the gutters , streaming , splashing against a concrete walkway two stories below . beside her sat an open box , and on one flap , written in another s hand , it read  paris , 1929 .  from this box , she drew another photograph . newline newline she held it up to the light , squinted , saw nothing , and then pressed it against the window . newline newline grey light shone through : young women dining one summer s day , cobbled city streets , aperitifs , a newly concocted soup that never took , fur coats , strings of pearls , rolled stockings , cloche hats . newline newline all the women had joked and hid their faces as the photographer , a friend of a friend of a friend , had taken the shot . newline newline coming from outside , eleanor heard laughter . newline newline she let the photograph slip to the floor and watched as a little girl  5 , 6 , 7 ?  sprinted out onto the grass . the girl ran and pumped her little arms until she met a puddle sitting in the middle of the lawn , throwing water into the air . when she slid to a stop , the girl slipped off and threw away her shoes and then , still darned to her knees in sock , she began to kick and stomp newline newline the girl played for who knows how long . as she played and the rain washed over her , her hair grew clung to her face and neck . the hem of her floral dress drew brown with mud . she span , punched , laughed , kicked daises into the sleet , laughed more , on and on until she began to tire . and then , when the girl could move no more , condensation falling , she sat her bottom right down in the deepest section of the puddle and the excess water escaped onto the grass . her face flushed red . newline newline worried thoughts infiltrated eleanor s mind . she banged on the window but the girl could not hear her . she gripped to both sides of the windowframe and pulled , but it would not move . she heaved once more , but again there was nothing . left with no other choice , she tried to squeeze herself out of the chair , but then suddenly , as if in answer to her prayers , eleanor heard a door sliding open below . newline newline watching , a man jogged out onto the lawn with a newspaper held over his head and a woolen sweater bundled in his other arm . when the little girl saw the man coming toward her , she dragged herself to her feet . she crossed her arms , but her father ignored the protest on her face and drew the sweater over her head until it was well past her knees . when he was done , he lightly patted his daughter s hair , said something sweet but who can remember , and jogged himself back inside . newline newline in the rain . alone once more , the girl tried to spin and kick again . but the moment was lost . she chased after her father . newline newline edit : happy ending : newline newline below , the door slid to a close again . eleanor listened to the growls of parents , to the fleeing , chasing , laughter . and then , heart beating , the tiny footsteps clambered up the staircase . the old woman stared at the attic door and wiped away the last few tears . in burst the girl , into her arms , wet , smelling of daisies and mud .newline newline it tasted like ashes on the tip of his tongue . he swallowed the pill , drank the glass of water someone gave him . newline newline he opened his eyes . it hurt . something was pressing against his eyeballs . he could feel it worming into his skull . he shut his eyes . newline newline  daniel , can you open your eyes ?  newline newline he covered a hand over his face and opened his eyes slowly again , peeking through the gaps in his fingers . he pulled his fingers together after a moment , sighing as his sight cut off again . the pressure in his skull eased slightly , although his pulse was still throbbing in his temple . newline newline  it still stings .  he said . newline newline  did you see anything ? anything at all ?  a sigh . newline newline  i saw ... i think .  he said , when he heard the man before him fidget .  it s different ... like , feeling sand for the first time ? i do nt know how to describe it .  newline newline he heard the edge of the man s chair shift forward . he heard the sharp , eager intake of the man s breath .  do you feel this ?  someone placed a small apple in his hand , followed by a leaf . newline newline  yes . it s an apple and a leaf .  newline newline  open your eyes again and take a look at them .  newline newline he opened his eyes briefly and screwed them shut again .  i saw .  the pain spiked in his temple . he tried not to react . newline newline  the apple was red . the leaf was green .  the man told him ,  did they look the same to you ?  newline newline  the apple was ... more ?  he said . newline newline he felt the frown , even if he could nt see it . the man s breathing changed , depressing slightly .  hold this . it s a card with two circles on it . please look at it .  newline newline  my head ...  newline newline  daniel . please .  it was not a request . newline newline he opened his eyes slightly , shutting them immediately ,  i see two circles .  he flinched as blood pounded behind his eyes . newline newline  did they look the same to you ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline a sigh . more disappointment . he rubbed the side of his head , breathing through his mouth .  were they different ?  newline newline  yes . one was red . the other was green .  a sigh ,  going from blind to colourblind ... that s some improvement at least ...  newline newline he was nt meant to hear that comment , he knew . the man was speaking very softly , to himself . he pretended he had nt heard . newline newline  try to keep your eyes open .  the man said ,  your vision is already restored but ... you just need practice adjusting to light .  newline newline  the pills make my head hurt .  he said .  why ?  newline newline  it s just your eyes , daniel . you re just getting used to seeing .  a lie . the man s breath caught just a little . newline newline  i ... do nt think so .  he said .  it s wrong . it hurts . the apple smells like rot when i see it . the card feels like human skin when i see it . you ... when i see you ... you sound like a thing wearing a corpse . are you ... human ?  newline newline a beat . a soft intake of breath .  of course i am daniel .  the man said ,  these strange ideas of yours  ... perhaps your mind is simply adjusting to the idea of sight as a new stimuli .  newline newline another lie . he felt his tongue dry inside his throat . newline newline  daniel , you do want to see , do nt you ?  newline newline not anymore .  ... yes .  he had a feeling that saying no would not be good for him . newline newline  then keep taking your pills . you ll be able to see soon . then i ll bring you outside to continue the rest of your treatment . yes ... you ll see everything soon ...  a pause . the chair squeaked as the man rose . he heard footsteps heading away and the swinging of a door .  i ll see you again tomorrow , daniel .  newline newline the door swung slowly shut . he heard the latch click . he opened his eyes quickly , scanning the room in a second before the lights overhead switched off . newline newline he saw ... a stool . a single lamp overhead . a thin , sheetless bunk bed . a barred window with leaves outside . darkness . his shoulders relaxed a bit and he blinked in the darkness . he walked to where he remembered the barred window was and felt around for the bars . they felt rough ... rusty . he fumbled around with his pill bottle , unscrewing the thick metal lid . he held it against the base of the bar where the metal was weakened and corroded . newline newline slowly , he began chiselling ... newline newlinethe cool mountain air carried the scent of danger . thand breathed deeply of the rich scent of the forest . he was alone , a rare privilege these days . as the scion of one of the five xopa houses , and highest ranking xopa commander in the imperial army , his soldiers and servants always surrounded him . he knew some of the humans under his command mocked him for keeping to the old ways of his people . he snorted to himself as he thought of the puny humans and their torches , horses , guns , and dogs . no , the true test of the warrior was to face the darkness alone . newline newline somewhere in the darkness ahead , under the cold light of the moon , a panther screamed . thand  s blood chilled at the sound as he instinctively moved toward it . his prey was a predator herself , and he silently congratulated her on her kill . he prayed to be so lucky when he would find her . his eyes were already adjusting to the darkness , and his other senses conveyed so much more of what the woods would say . he pitied his human comrades who would never know the secrets of the forest . newline newline despite thand  s heightened senses , it was the whistling that alerted him to their presence . he instinctively dropped into the fighting stance taught to him by his teachers . as the son of a sinjoro , he had of course been taught to fight in the imperial style , although his father had demanded that he and his brothers learn the old ways as well . the result had been a very peculiar blend of old and new that made thand one of the most formidable fighters in the empire . newline newline the whistling intensified as a dozen xopa warriors emerged from the trees in a rough circle around him . in the darkness their chestnut skin and rich green braids blended well with the woods . newline newline look , a lost little rastilneta one mocked him with the slur free xopa used to describe their brethren who had joined the empire . newline newline all alone without any men or guns to protect him another said . newline newline the speech of the xopa sounded like the rustle of the wind through leaves , and carried the unmistakable lilt of laughter . stepping forward into the clearing , thand could see that they were lean , wiry and ropy , despite being nearly nine feet tall . they were naked except for loincloths , although the leader was wearing a pouched vest as well . their simple costumes were in sharp contrast to thand  s attire . newline newline dressed in the blue and butternut of the imperial army of ortinia , with his brown leather boots , thand looked ridiculous . as xopa were almost one and a half times the size of a man , his tunic and pants were large and loose . at his hip he reached reflexively for his holster , only to remember that he had left it behind . the only weapon he had with him was his traditional ostri blade . newline newline are you ready to die , rastilneta ?  another taunted him , as the circle feinted in and out around him . newline newline thand stoop up , revealing his impressive tenfoot height .  i am thandizwe sin arakwe . my father was galza sin arakwe . his father was syabu doxar sin arakwe . i can trace my ancestry back to mizuxi himself . you are nothing but bandits and beggars ,  he said with a wellearned arrogance . he undid the brass buttons and shrugged off his tunic . newline newline the moonlight revealed his beautiful , scarred body . there were marks from the fights his father had demanded of him , from the duels he had fought on his long rise to power , and from his many battles for the ortinians . he hefted the ostri blade as he stared at the leader . newline newline  this blade was made in the old way , from the stinger of the giant daggerwasp . i killed the queen and drank her dream honey myself . i blooded this blade when i was but eight summers old , on raider scum just like you ,  thand growled . his eyes flicked from warrior to warrior . thand knew he was outnumbered twelve to one . he had to draw them in . newline newline  when i kill you , i will burn your bodies . i will throw the ashes into the great salt . your seed will shrivel up and die . your spirits will be izkhoreni , condemned to howl in the wastes for all eternity.  this last insult finally proved too much and one warrior charged him with a fierce cry . newline newline thand  s ostri met his attacker in the throat , spilling his rich sweet blood on the pine needles . as the warrior  s momentum carried him forward , thand buried his blade in the xopa  s back . the warrior  s lifeless body collapsed to the floor . newline newline a new respect appeared in the eyes of the leader and the older veterans . a growing fear warred behind the eyes of some of the younger warriors . another charged thand from the side . newline newline thand dropped his shoulder and flipped the charging warrior into the air . with a fearsome upward slash , he was coated in the blood of the warrior . his opponent was dead before he hit the ground . thandize we , covered in blood , heard the ritual song of his ancestors on the wind . the blood lust was on him . newline newline he turned and eyed the smallest warrior . his markings were the same as the leader . ahh , thought thand , and here is where his weakness will lie .  shall i kill your seedling in front of you ?  he challenged the leader . newline newline the leader  s face became a mask of rage as he ordered , kill him the circle closed on thand . ostris and knives flashed in the darkness in the cold light of the moon . for every wound thand received he gave two . he repeated his mantra again and again .  i am thandizwe sin arakwe.  slash , stab .  i am the blood of mizuxi.  parry , thrust . when one warrior buried his ostri in thand  s back he grunted and eviscerated the fool with his blade when the warrior struggled to pull it out . another struck him in the chest before thand  s blade cut him down . he bled from two dozen wounds as the soft ground soaked up the sweet blood of eleven xopa . newline newline thand staggered around like a wounded bull , slashing and parrying with his blade as he cut them down . i am thandizwe sin arakwe . another warrior fell . i am the blood of mizuxi . a xopa warrior uttered a guttural scream as he was disembowled . i am thandizwe sin arakwe . the leader s ostri came up feebly . i am the blood of mizuxi . the leader  s lifeless green eyes stared at nothing as his disembodied head rolled away from his corpse . thand fell to one knee , half wresting on his ostri for support . no fewer than six blades had been broken on his body . ahead of him was only the seedling , who held his ostri in front of him with both trembling hands . newline newline  come , little weed . come and fight me . blood your ostri on the blood of mizuxi himself.  the seedling took a step backwards . even mortally wounded , thand was a terrifying sight . thand took pity on the young warrior , surely he could not be much older than his tenth summer . newline newline  this will be the song they will sing of you . you will be the one who killed thandizwe sin arakwe.  he cajoled the boy .  all you must do is strike me down . give me the warrior  s death.  newline newline the seedling took a tentative step forward , almost running when thand raise his ostri .  no !  thand barked ,  you must earn my blood , little weed . become a warrior today , and strike me down , or i will kill you myself and burn your body.  the boy  s eyes hardened and he nodded . he lunged at thand , who parried his inexpert thrust easily . newline newline  pathetic  he laughed , as the seedling picked himself up .  i will cut your hand off if you try something that foolish again.  thand coughed up some more blood .  do it quickly boy , or i will die with your ostri unblooded.  the seedling charged again , and thand rewarded him with a slash across the face . newline newline the seedling howled as the blood rushed through his fingers . thand roared up at the sky ,  i have bled you . i have killed your clansmen . i have killed your father . now will you kill me ? or are you too much of a cowurk  thand looked down at the blade of the ostri emerging from his chest . thandizwe looked over his shoulder at the bloody seedling who had run him through . thandizwe grinned at him .  your blade has taken this life ,  his chest heaved as blood bubbled a the corners of his mouth ,  little warrior . now i will show you . a true . xopa .  newline newline the youth stood in shock as thandizwe sin arakwe fell forward with a thud . he pulled his ostri from the corpse and turned to look for his father . his father  s head was laying on its side some distance from its body . the warrior picked it up and kissed its forehead before closing his father  s eyes . he dragged all dozen bodies to the base of a dozen trees , giving honor to all the warriors who had fallen in this battle in the wood . the sun was coming up by the time he was finished . he collected his prizes , the boots and jacket of thandizwe , his father  s vest , the pouches of all the warriors , but their weapons he left for their journey to the beyond . the young warrior paid his last respects to his father , and to thandizwe sin arakwe , and began the long lonely trek back to his village . newline not so fast , stephenson !  the teenagers lined up in front of the throne , ready to fight to protect the realm .  we seven teenagers are the destined ones , to defeat evil when it rises ! we shall triumph !  newline  yes , you are destined to defeat evil when it reigns  the man drawled his words , confidence oozing next to the blood of the guards .  but seven of you ? ...  thunk  i only count six  . he smiled as he strolled past the horrified friends to the throne . newline  destined you may be to defeat me in the future , but teenagers you are today .  he raised his crossbow and blade and shooed them to the door . newline  now bugger off and do nt come back until you actually have learnt to fight . otherwise you ll end up like your friend there .  the teens fled , screaming revenge . he paid them no heed . picking up the crown , he tossed it onto the corpse and sat down . newline  come now , prince valryn . get up . in

i ca nt tell them the truth . if i do tell them , they might kick me out or kill me , for not helping end this issue . newline newline recently , i ve become pretty bad at lying , and i ve said things that seem too good to be true . the other day i claimed that i had single handedly killed a horde of zombies  a horde in our group is 10 zombies or more  and everyone told me that was bs and i do nt

good amount of supplies , but little to no marks on me saying i was in a fight . the only reason i can get these supplies is because i know where a supermarket is hidden within the trees that has nt been found by anyone else as of yet . there are no zombies there that i have seen , and i ve only seen very few wandering around that area , so i just waltz in , take some supplies , and waltz out . newline newline every time people see me come back with a ton of resources , but no marks , they always get mad at me and make me feel embarrassed due to not fighting like i should be . i always walk around the camp with eyes looking down on me , and some people have even offered to take me with them on their resource runs and teach me how to actually kill something , because obviously i ca nt do

the feminine form , as if with another of adam s ribs , god had anointed the barren landscape with those same sweet curves . newline newline tomas s thoughts drifted to the cool summer nights under the stars on vacation in morocco , where he traced his finger over the sweet curves of his love , alala , a flower of immaculate beauty , a dreamer of lands full of peace and discovery . together they learned about life and how to find the puzzle pieces that make it truly worth living . they d kissed under the stars and explored each other s bodies , becoming one being in the most intimate communication of love . they made love and their love made life . newline newline tomas glanced at the rearview mirror to check on his cargo . the heavyduty metal boxes were marked in a stenciled language he could nt read , but more importantly they had not fallen out the back . he d been told not to jostle the contents too much , and tomas figured he had no reason to doubt the suggestions of his employer . newline newline tomas looked out the front window again at the vast , unending sahara , and noticed a break in the blank monotony . off in the distance , a barely distinguishable projection was rising from the expansive desert floor . it was barely noticeable , but it was definitely something . tomas squinted in vain at the blip as he drove into the nothingness , toward his destination in nigeria . newline newline alala was four months pregnant back home in niger , cooking cassava and stew with a nice curry spice her friend kamaria gave her , when there was a knock at the door . tomas walked over and cautiously turned the knob , and with a bang , the door was flung open . newline newline a stream of men in red beret hats and military khakis filed into the house , decked out in ak47s and heavy boots . a soldier in the front grabbed tomas and threw him to the floor . tomas lashed out with his legs and caught the aggressor low , knocking his feet from underneath him . tomas turned his head toward the other soldiers just in time to see the butt of the rifle coming toward his face . the last thing he felt before the world faded to black was the rough caress of a burlap sack being crudely stuffed over his head , and the plastic vibrations of a zip tie being cinched around his hands . newline newline it s a tree , thought tomas , as he squinted again into the distance . out in the middle of this wilderness , battered by sandstorms and the desert sun , with no life other than tomas within thousands of kilometers , there was a tree . it was probably from an ancient forest , a thriving past ecosystem that was slowly choked by the reach of the desert s sandy fingers . one by one , the surrounding trees died off , their gnarled bark weathered with the incessant winds . eventually , all life had left the forest , carried off by the sand or pushed to more friendly regions . all except this one tree . newline newline tomas awoke a soldier . if you fight us , we will kill you , they said . take these clothes , they said , and brandished the very military khakis and red beret that had pushed him to the ground . take this gun , they said . we will go to the next village and recruit all the men and rape all the women , and kill all the women who resist , they said . we killed your wife , they said . tomas needed to be restrained again after that one . newline newline he stared at the tree as it slowly grew in size . it looked like an old acacia , gnarled and weathered by time . how many of his brethren did this methuselah see dry up into hollow stumps , to be taken away by the piercing glass sand . how totally and utterly alone . newline newline tomas ran away , or rather tumbled away , down a cliff face as his war group was preparing to take over another village . he turned to the right and just stepped into the air . both arms still clicked when he raised them above his head because the broken bones had healed out of place . a truck driving job in nigeria was his only prospect . the only thing in his life , really . newline newline tomas turned the wheel slightly as his truck continued toward the tree , the first time he had done so in hours . they were here , together . the gnarled old wood of the acacia had seen generations come and go , pass by in life and pass on in death . he was the last of his brethren , the only piece left in a beautiful puzzle . tomas smiled widely as his truck approached the tree . they were here , together , in this moment , connected by life and death and perfectly shaped to fit each other s puzzles . for the first time since the curry cassava and stew , tomas felt the fullbody tingles that accompany inexplicable love . his heart swelled with pride , and love , and a connection to everything the world was . newline newline the engine block of tomas s toyota buried itself in his groin and continued through his stomach , tearing him nearly in half , before it collided with the delicate contents of the containers in the back of his truck . the ensuing flames licked wood and flesh alike into ash . for nearly an hour the fire raged , redhot tendrils doing perverse dances on tomas and the tree s twin grave . newline newline the blaze died down , leaving a charred metal skeleton and a pile of bleached bones . the skull and broken jaw , haphazardly arranged , almost seemed to form a smile in the red shadows of the saharan sunset . newline newline tl  dr http : en.wikipedia.orgwikiarbredut  c3  a9n  c3  a9r  c3  a9the screams echoed over the nowboggy wasteland , the dead

maebeleine was nt so sure , but if there was one thing her mother taught her , it was how to spot a liar .  what are you hiding from me , jaeson ?  she asked . newline newline  nothing ,  he asserted . newline newline she flipped her bright , red hair out of her vibrant , green eyes .  i do nt believe you ,  she said ,  you re keeping a secret .  newline newline  no i m not .  he was clearly lying

never really thought it would work . it was a sweet gesture  her boyfriend trying to work on a solution for the problem that had crippled her entire life . but it could nt really work . newline newline  it turns your hairblack ?  she said , so softly he had to ask her to repeat herself . newline newline he leaned over and kissed her .  pitch black . now , please , go dye it . and go to the interview . please.  newline newline her face crumbled and she turned away from him . like all bornblondes , she had never been given a chance . she  d fought her way through university , to prove she was nt stupid . some of her professors had cheered and patted themselves on the back for being progressive enough to allow a bornblonde in the classroom . newline newline pretending it mattered , that society was progressing beyond its prejudices . an empty gesture , in the end . noone trusted that she could do the job , even with her degree . she was , quite simply , blonde . the brilliance andrew saw every day , the edge of her humour and mind , didn  t matter . noone  s hair turned black from moments of cleverness . newline newline  dye it ,  he whispered .  please . just dye it , and go out . try one more time , for me.  newline newline she took a deep breath , and finally nodded . she heaved herself up and grabbed the bottle to disappear into the bathroom . he heard the sound of running water . when she emerged , her hair was a sleek and shiny black . she smiled tremulously at herself in the mirror , and ran her fingers through it . newline newline  you should share it ,  she said .  you should give it out to everyone . for free . stop this from happening to anyone else .  newline newline he saw again the countless faces of those who jeered at his girlfriend on the street , who refused to listen to a word she said , just on principle . the people who nudged each other and stifled grins when she tried to make a point . the people who had allowed the selfassured , happy woman he d fallen in love with to fade to this shadow of herself . newline newline  i will ,  he promised .  but once everyone has black hair , it won  t matter . i just want you to get a little revenge , first . i want you to go out there and listen as they beg you to work for them . please  go kick ass now .  newline newline she tied her hair up , and he thought he saw a glimmer of her old self in the set of her mouth and eyes . newline newline she turned to kiss him . newline newline  just be yourself , ok ?  he said , and hugged her close . newline newline        newline hope you enjoyed my story ! you can find more of my work on rinkfinger .this day is going to be perfect . i m sitting on a bench in the workers quarters of hotel rolling hills enjoying my water . usually we d be cleaning the rooms on the 60th to 62nd floor around this time but today another group has to take our shift . the overseer gave us the day off and wants to talk to every one of us in his office . newline newline  hey a5 !  newline newline ah , fbfb82 just came back .  yes ?  newline newline  i m to tell you you re next .  newline newline  yes .  i get up and make my way over to the elevator . newline newline the overseer s office is above all of the guest rooms almost at the top of the building . above it there s only the manager s floor and the roof . newline the manager s a weird man . i think he s a master , the overseer bows before him , but i saw him bow before the president just yesterday . newline just thinking about it hurts my head . maybe the masters have other masters . newline maybe i should get back to work . newline newline immediately after i arrive i knock at the overseer s door . newline newline  come in .  he does nt waste any time and calls out before i can greet him ,  fbfba5 , correct ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  good . where were you yesterday at 8:15 p.m. and what were you doing ?  newline newline easy . we were scheduled for cleaning after the opera . 8:00 to 8:13 p.m.  in the performance hall . i was replacing a broken table .  newline newline  did you see the manager alexander fontaine at that time .  newline newline  yes .  newline newline the overseer walks to the back room and leaves me without a task . newline so the manager has a name . i knew he was nt a worker . but why did he bow ? newline the president s a master and the manager shot him . he could nt have been a worker . but why did he bow ? newline i m rubbing my temples by the time the overseer returns . newline newline  this is the one you were looking for sir .  newline newline  good work , fb29a2 .  newline newline ah that voice . i breathe in deeply and bow down quickly . newline newline  so you were the one who s dopey smile i saw on the camera footage .  newline newline i always loved seeing the manager but it s even better when he talks to me . no idea if he asked me a question though . newline newline  yes that smile precisely . very good . did you talk to anyone about what you saw me doing yesterday ?  newline newline  no sir .  every word he says makes my stomach tingle . newline newline  good . fb29a2 and..  he looks at my number tag . he looks at me ! this day could not possibly get any better . newline  fb29a2 and fbfba5 , would you kindly jump out the window ?  newline newlinemadelyn story continued newline newline part 4 newline newline  please it s for a friend !  said chanyeol . more aegyo was done . xiumin sighed .  you know we could get in trouble with managernim ,  xiumin said .  it s worth the risk  said chanyeol heroicly .  oh brother  said baekhyun .  you mean to tell me you would get in trouble for someone ,  asked sehun .  not anyone its for my friend madelyn  said chanyeol innocently . baekhyun and d.o looked at each other .  why would we get in trouble for some girl ,  asked sehun waving his hand . chanyeol got defensive .  she not some.girl , she is  chanyeol stopped to think not wanting to reveal himself while he also got confused with himself.xiumin sighed with his hand on his face .  i understand i ll help you ,  said xiumin with a smile.  we will help too  said baekhyun and d.o .  thanks guys , i owe you one ,  said chanyeol . then he was off to prepare a few things .  ah , poor chanyeol , he is so childish ,  said sehun.  ya , you better not mess up chanyeol s plan ,  said baekhyun.everyone knows how sehun could be .  ok ,  yelled sehun as he walked away . newline newline part 5 newline madelyn was browsing for new glasses .  those would look good in you  newline said the cashier .  i would like those then ,  said madelyn .  how much will it cost ?  she asked .  they are free ,  said the cashier .  thanks  exclaimed madelyn .  that was strange , free glasses ,  thought madelyn .  i wonder if chanyeol is at the cafe ,  she thought .  why am i thinking about him ?  she thought . she went back to the cafe . newline she could not resist . she sat in the same place looking out the window .  this is stupid ,  thought madelyn .  ya !  a deep voice said . madelyn saw chanyeol waving at her , she could nt help smiling at him .  you got new glasses ,  i almost did nt recognize you ,  said chanyeol as her sat down across from her .  they complement you ,  he said .  thanks i know  said madelyn as she flipped her playfully .  as your sunbaenim i should show you around ,  said chanyeol .  sure why not  she answered . madelyn had a free day and might as well do something .  great  said chanyeol . he grabbed her hand and ran out the door again . when they were out on the street madelyn said  ok warn next time , were running somewhere .   oh sorry  he said scratching his head shyly . he showed her fashion spots and historical sites . finally he said  i m going to show you a secret place ,  . madelyn noticed he was serious .  ok let s go ,  madelyn said curiously . they went through woods to a white gazebo .  this is where i used to go , before i became a member of exo  he said while sitting down.  i would come here to clear my mind or just get fresh air  he said while looking up . he closed his eyes and stretched out . he was clearly relaxed.  what stopped you from coming here ?  asked madelyn .  hectic schedules , ya know , if i do get the chance it s quite rare ,  he said sitting up to look at her . the wind blew leaves in a whirlwind and there was silence .  how beautiful ,  he remarked . the wind blew again this time blowing leaves towards them . madelyn breathed in and out  this is relaxing  she said . chanyeol noticed a leaf got stuck in her hair .  you got a leaf in your hair  he chuckled . madelyn turned to him slightly embarrassed . he plucked it out her hair . their eyes met . they were close enough . chanyeol ran his hand through her hair as he got close . madelyn could nt help to get closer too . everything was moving in slowmotion as heat in their bodies would rise . chanyeol could feel butterflies in the pit of his stomach . they inched closer , and closer . then . newline newline  hug , hug hug me ,  chanyeol  s phone went off . he quickly backed up and got text saying  ready  . madelyn blinked twice and was lost .  what just happened ,  she thought . she pushed thoughts to the back if her head ignoring it completely.  i got another place to show you ,  chanyeol exclaimed .  we are running ,  chanyeol grabbed her hand and ran for the sm entertainment company . newline newline they stopped at the destination . madelyn was shocked .  this is..  she said .  yep ,  he answered  s.m entertainment  . they got to the exo room . he opened the door ,  surprise !  yelled exo .  happy birthday !  d.o said as he put as crown on madelyn head .  you should nt celebrate this alone ,  said baekhyun as he put a crown on chanyeol s head too .  wow thanks ,  said madelyn puzzled . she has been so busy with studies , she forgot about her own birthday .  how did you know about my birthday ,  she asked .  i saw it out on kyung hee s post .  chanyeol answered . newline suho says  al duel set  then they blew candles at the same time . newline they blew the candles , but chanyeol realizes how close they are then he blushes and moves quickly away . newline madelyn was oblivious to this . however sehun noticed this and stepped in . he promised not to ruin chanyeol s plan .  i did nt say anything about her , and the party is here  thought sehun .  what are you thinking about  asked xiumin . xiumin was a suspicious man and knows sehun to well .  nothing  another easy lie told by sehun . lay put on chanyeol s favorite song . slow down , grab the wall , wiggle ... chanyeol whipped his head in the direction of the beat . newline  come dance with me  said chanyeol .  no thanks  said madelyn . she was nt much of a dancer especially to this type of music . going outside to catch some air she noticed how pretty the night sky is . she leans on the balcony and sighs .  the sky sure is beautiful is nt it ?  said a voice from behind . turning she sees that it is sehun the youngest . newline  yeah  said madelyn lazily . newline  but it s not as beautiful as you ... .  he said .  thanks ,  said madelyn with a blank expression . leaning on the balcony he said  i m sehun  . i know who you are ,  said madelyn dryly .  how we just met did nt we ?  newline glaring at him she was beginning to get irritated .  no need to get defensive it was just a joke.  he said.  what do you want ?  asked madelyn.  just a simple chat  said sehun .  is something wrong ?  he asked.  i just do nt like noisy people  said madelyn .  how stingy  thought sehun forcing a smile .  me neither , tell me , what s the difference between curiosity and being noisy ?  madelyn said nothing .  well that s what the last foreigner chanyeol met ,  asked me .  last foreigner ?  asked madelyn .  yeah he always meets with foreign women . in his spare time that is ... it s like a hobby for him i suppose .  he said .  hobby ?  thought madelyn .  you seem like the sort who be one of his ladyfriends .  i m just his friend  said madelyn or at least i thought i was  thought madelyn .  that s what he would call them i guess .  said sehun .  now i do nt think there is a difference between curiosity and obsession . gas pedal gas pedal the music bumped in the apartment . chanyeol could be seen doing the whip with suho and xiumin . madelyn was starting to leave . she did nt want to be some creeps foreign version of pokemon and she was told to watch out for people like this . she left the party unnoticed . newline newline she walked home questioning herself .  why did i even hang out with that guy in the first place ,  she thought . madelyn knew her reason to go to korea was to get a education .  it seemed so odd ,  she thought .  meeting a stranger , well not really , he is famous ,  she thought.  i still do nt know him though ,   but i did get to talk to him and get to know him   i wonder if i should talk to him again ,   i probably wo nt get to see him again ,   if i do..  madelyn frowned . she decided that it would be best if she just forgot about chanyeol . newline newline madelyn received an unexpected call from her friend reanna . she was happy to hear that she as visiting korea . sam was also visiting korea for a short time . they decided to all meet up , but reanna insisted on surprising them . later that evening ... newline  wow this place is amazing !  said sam . reanna made a reservation at a 5 star restaurant for them . newline  impressive ,  said madelyn and she added a hair flip . they all chuckled . well is sure is nice seeing you guys again said reanna .  what have you guys been up to ?  said sam . not much said madelyn  i have been studying at a korean university .  i  m a dealer now ,  said reanna .  that  s it ? all this money because of that . wow  said madelyn .  well , that and i own several restaurants , including this one ,  reanna said while scratching her neck from embarrassment .  you must be rich no wonder were at this place ,  said sam astounded .  don  t mean to brag , but i kind of am  said reanna . they all laughed .  boy when i tell you i had this crazy dream.  newline what was is it ?  asked madelyn .  well , its kinda embarassing  said sam .  we wo nt judge you ,  said reanna .  ok , so i met vixx , but not all at once . hyuk was eating , ravi as rapping lifestyle ,  leo and ken were kings . then n would vanish and reappear at random . then tiffany dissed ravi rapping , and i had to save her . i had a dance battle against jokwon , and won ! the best part of the dream was when i saved tiffany !   that s so funny !  madelyn exclaimed . sam turned to reanna . newline  reanna are you okay , you look sick  said sam . madelyn quirked an eyebrow , wondering what could possibly be wrong with her beloved friend . newline  i  m fine , i just remembered i got an errand to run . bye guys lets meet up again sometime later.  said reanna .  oh okay  said madelyn . sam and madelyn shared more stories and decided that they would meet again soon . for now , madelyn bid her friend a farewell . she enjoyed her night.the next morning she went to her favorite cafe . newlinecure for cancer discovered newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  this new miraclecure , called  qejix  , and released by a coalition of many different wellknown international drugproducing corporations , is , according to thousands of clinical trials over many years , able to cure all forms of cancer . this came after an investigation began on corruption in the drugproduction industry . the investigation started because there was significant evidence that these companies were putting donations into their pockets instead into actual research . these companies stated that they have been researching this drug for years , and used all of the donated money to purchase the equipment needed to find this cure . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  however , former employees do not agree that these companies stated to us that this cure was discovered forty years ago , and was kept in hiding until these companies would need to protect their pr image . they also said that nearly most of the donated money went straight to the ceos of these businesses , and that the rest went to  researchers  to make them shut up about the fact that they are , in fact , doing nothing at all . newline newline  nbsp   nbsp   nbsp   nbsp  we , though , at the newspaper office , funded greatly by these wonderful companies , believe that those former employees were lying about it to take away money from the glorious cancerresearch industry , and that everyone should throw more money at them to fund more affordable drugs . the price of the recentlyreleased qejix is estimated to be around  750,000 , but can be paid off in loans with about 50  apr , which , in our opinion , is much better than the alternative . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline edit : however , i used  however  a bit too much . rick . he  s back.  newline newline the floor supervisor leaned over the security console . the cameras on the casino floor covered every angle . and there , in the middle  third time this month ,  said the guard .  as if he doesn  t know we  re going to spot him.  newline newline  get rid of him ,  said rick .  and ask him why the hell he  s still trying.  newline newline outside in the pouring rain oliver shook himself and his sport coat free of the security guard  s grip .  that  s quite enough , thank you ,  he said in his weaselly little voice . newline newline  got ta ask ,  said the guard , keeping one hand on his notallthatconcealed weapon .  we know what you look like . and we know what you do . why are you still trying ?  newline newline  because ,  said oliver ,  there  s still an eleven percent chance that you  ll miss me.  newline newline the guard scoffed .  impossible . we  re watching every square inch of this casino twentyfour seven . multiple eyes on multiple camera feeds , and believe me , every single one of them recognizes their face by now.  newline newline  i assure you , i am never wrong . eleven percent . if you had those chances for winning your way to retirement , wouldn  t you do it ?  he started to turn away . newline newline  wait !  said the guard .  you can tell us what we  re doing wrong ?  newline newline oliver raised his eyebrows .  i could , or at least make some educated guesses . will i ? i don  t think we have that kind of relationship.  newline newline  i could put in a word  newline newline  every five seconds you spend talking to me increases the chances of your boss asking uncomfortable questions by six percent . go on in , buster . have a good day.  newline newline  be seeing you ,  said the guard , almost but not quite a question . newline newline  oh , eightynine percent chance , give or take ,  said oliver , and grinned . you have to try it .  newline newline they stood before the power station , eyes skyward , examining the tangle of power lines crisscrossing overhead in the early twilight . the station was empty , the few maintenance guys who staffed the location long since headed home . it left the two of them plenty of room to find a way to get in , even if they had opted to simply cut their way through the chain link fence . newline newline  you sure ?  newline newline henry and angel were nothing special to one another , their only tie being their ability to channel mana into harmless little spells . they had found each other by accident  as far as they knew , they were the only people who could do what they did . despite that , their time spent together learning to slowly harness their abilities had led lots of whispers among their respective social circles that maybe they were having a little more than innocent fun . newline newline  i accidentally did something like it at home . i m pretty sure this is just a matter of scale . bigger source , bigger boom .  newline newline angel grinned at him . she was always excited to push herself , finding new ways to cast or channel spells . that she had been willing to toy around with electricity to see how it affected her did not surprise him in the least . he only worried how she had even come across the idea in the first place . taking another glance skyward , he corrected himself . he also worried how this would turn out for him . newline newline  i dunno ...  newline newline  do nt be a pussy .  newline newline he did nt like when she used vulgarity when it was nt necessary . calling him names was not necessary . she noticed him bristling and laughed . newline newline  what s wrong , guilty conscious ?  newline newline he shook his head , sighing . newline newline  so how does this work ?  newline newline  that s more like it !  she laughed .  at home , i was messing around and accidentally drew power from a power cord for one of the lamps . cat was playing with something , and i leaned off the couch to try and shock him . get him to stop , you know ? turns out i was leaning on the lamp s cord . it was a bit more juice than expected !  newline newline  that s it ?  newline newline  oh hell no ! i wanted to make sure it was nt an accident , so i messed with it a few more times . turns out , it s really easy to grab a power cord and supercharge yourself .  newline newline  i dunno ... sounds like it could be dangerous .  newline newline  you worry too much . once you know what you re doing , it s no problem at all .  newline newline  once you know what you re doing ? god , angel .  newline newline she pouted , sticking her lip at him defiantly .  it s not hard .  newline newline he rolled his eyes .  fine . whatever .  newline newline grinning again , she turned back to the power station .  from what i can tell , its just a matter of placing your hand on it and then treating it like part of you . go on , try it !  newline newline tentatively , he lifted his hand and inched it towards the transformer , eventually gritting his teeth and slapping his palm on it in a swift motion . outside of a slight vibration , the only discomfort was the natural cool of the metal . surprised , he tested it with his mind , poking it mentally . newline newline there was almost a rubbery tension to it , a barrier just below the metal that was barely stretched over an immense source of power . following his usual ritual , he started muttering to himself , reciting prime numbers to focus his mind , trying to get some semblance of order . when his thoughts had stilled themselves into the practiced rhythm of moving through the numbers , he began shaping the spell . newline newline he was nt looking for anything impressive , just to test how much juice he could draw from the station . settling on something angel had dubbed the mind bullet , he shaped the magic and pointed his fingers away , aiming into the empty distance beyond the fence they had cut their way through . newline newline when he thought himself ready , he released the charge , making the instinctive shooting motion with his fingers . with a silent sigh , the force left his body . the only indication that anything happened was a sudden crack , and then the fence was simply gone . newline newline they glanced at each other , frozen . newline newline  that s ... scary .  newline newline  yeah .  her voice was quiet . for all her bravado , she had not expected that . newline newline  i think that maybe , we should nt mess with this .  newline newline  yeah .  she stared at the station .  maybe .  newline newline  angel , look at me .  she shot him a look and then went back to looking at the station . newline newline  this is big , man . this is big . we can do some real dresden shit with this .  newline newline  i do nt like the sound of that . he is not a good role model . you realize his solution to everything is literally kill it with fire  ?  newline newline she glared at him .  and ? it s nice to be able to do something proactive . i think what we do is too cool to hide . why not do something fancy , get some attention ?  newline newline  i do nt want that sort of attention . it sounds like a pain in the ass .  newline newline  then you do nt have to do anything . this is awesome . i want to use it .  newline newline  then do it on your own . i really do nt think i can change your mind on this . i d tell you to be careful , but there is nt anything to be careful about with this .  newline newline  gee , thanks .  she rolled her eyes , but did nt say anything else as he waited . still silent , she watched him hesitate and then leave . when he was out of sight , she turned back to the station . newline newline  now let s see what i can do with more than a lamp .  she grinned .  this is going to be fun . weak pathetic fools . i thought as i watched the news . everyone was panicking over the fact that some scientist had discovered that monsters in dreams can kill you . of course , per usual , the rich get fancy pills that cost more then most make in a year to keep them awake . people were dying , going crazy , doing all the things they do when the world spirals out of control . it s been a few weeks and is seemingly getting better though . people that have learned to fight back , control their dreams , or just straight stop dreaming are taking over . we all know despite our little control , it will happen to us . each and everyone of us . we know this because without dreams , we ca nt live . they drive us , or give us something to run from . i know it s going to happen to me soon . i have nt left the house in weeks . i m running out of alchol , and my mind is running to what little memories it loves the most . the pills i take to be happy are gone , i refuse the caffeine or just killing myself . i know what monsters lie in my head . i know where they hide and what makes them . if the world ca nt face the reality of a harsh dream , then what chance do i ? call it natural selection i guess . more in tune with our selves then we ve ever been . just another step , progress at the cost of all of us .you ever seen a building collapse in on itself ? it s selfcontained at first , the uppermost floors disappearing like god s just taken an eraser and rubbed them out . before long , though , it topples . debris starts falling this way and that , raining lethal chunks of rock down on the streets below . newline newline why is that relevant ? well , the moment after i took that letter from the young messenger s hand , sliced it open , and skimmed the intricate handwriting , my life turned from something with semistable foundations into a collapsing building . newline newline that damned letter . who d have thought something so small could have had such an effect ? my current predicament is completely down to that bloody letter . i practically know the thing off by heart ... newline newline                                         newline holt newline newline what i need you to do for me , once this letter is read , is burn it . burn any trace of it . burn the paper , burn the envelope . deal with the messenger if you deem it necessary . i have others .  newline newline once you ve done that , proceed onto your final target . you ve done me a great service over the centuries , killing those that i needed rid of , and now it s time for your final task . do this for me , and you ll earn your passage to the true afterlife . you ll be reunited with your family on the other side . all you ve ever dreamed of , holt , will be yours when this is over newline newline end this newline newline                      newline newline the first thing that hits me is the light . digging into my eyeballs , stabbing me right in the brain . it hurts . but i can move passed that , because it does nt hurt even half as much as the blade slowly being drawn up and down my naked back . newline newline  holt , my boy .  tuts a silhouetted figure stood behind the floodlamp , two bulky forms flanking him . my final target .  i thought you were better than this .  newline newline what irks me is the fact that i am better than this . getting caught ? that had been sloppy . i d been overconfident . too sure in my own abilities . newline newline i m sat tied to a chair . the back s been removed to provide easier access for the torturer wielding the coldiron knife . newline newline  maybe you want to untie me , eh ?  i m panting . between the working over my back s getting and the extreme heat in the room , i do nt know which is worse . i do know that both are equally affecting my ability to form coherent sentences .  we ll talk this over , have a drink . just like old times , yeah ? i can explain how this is all just one big mistake .  newline newline  where s your tongue at , holt ? always had a quick wit , you did . had an answer to everything . now , though , all trussed up like a pig ready for the slaughter , you re babbling .  newline newline  i ll babble you , you longnippled motherfucker !   christ , what am i saying ? newline newline the next thing i feel is the blade digging at least half an inch into the flesh , just above the small of my back . then the torturer slides the knife up the length of me . the steel rattles off my vertebrae , sending literal shivers up my back . i make a mental note to bring that man with the knife a horrible end before the day s out . newline newline  do you know the funny thing ?  asks the man in charge , striding into the light .  i was going to reward you for what you ve done for me . all those people killed in the mortal realm over the centuries ? you ve done me a great help . when i finally decide to invade , to claim it as my own , it ll be in part down to you .  newline newline  brilliant . why do nt you tell me about that over a pint ?  the torturer s going at my back like he s carving his initials into it . lots of little , shallow cuts . sharp pain , like stubbing your toe but a lot worse . newline newline  in fact , when they said you were at my front gate i thought that s what you wanted to see me about .  the devil s wearing a lovely white shirt with lilacs dotted all over it under a purple blazer . his tie and his pocket square are matching colours of red . he s slicked back his coaldark hair with product . shaved his cheeks and his jaw but let his goatee grow . newline newline he s stitched up the deep cut i gave him . the one looping from the right corner of his thin lips and over the bridge of his nose , coming to a stop just under his left eye . newline newline  nature of the job , yknow ? never trust a hired knife and all that .  i give a snort of laughter . i do nt feel like laughing , but sometimes you have to laugh . you understand ? life s hard . the afterlife s harder . laughing keeps things straight in your head . makes things a little easier to handle . newline newline  no . i m not taking the nature of the job  bullshit . you re going to tell me who ordered the hit on me . you re going to tell me or so help me i ll   newline newline  you ll what ? !   the fury sneaks up on me . even the torturer takes a hurried step backward .  threats of violence , of death , they re a little fucking redundant at this point . do nt you think ?  newline newline there s a pause . an unnerving silence . maybe the devil ll order a harsher torture . maybe he will , maybe he wo nt . does nt really matter . ca nt spend your life worrying . newline newline  ahh .  chuckles the devil , his features softening just a fraction .  there it is . there s the fire . i knew you had it in you , holt . you acted all cold , all heartless . put yourself out there as calm . in control . but at the end of the day it was all a mask , eh ? i always knew . man does nt get to rival death for lives claimed without a little fire in him .  newline newline just one more life . just one more and i ll be free . he s so close to me . if only i was free , if only i had a knife . if if if . too many if s , not enough thinking realistically . newline newline  now i know what you re thinking .  the devil continues .  that there is nt anything more i can do cept kill you again . the thing is . well , the thing is . that s just not true . there s a lot of things i can still do to you , holt . a lot more horrible than redeath . i promise , it ll all go a lot easier if you just tell me who ordered the hit !   newline newline  fuck you .  newline newline he backhands me . he s looks like a scrawny guy , but there s power there . it stings worse than all the cuts i ve taken today combined . numbs my jaw , my cheek . i reckon he s shattered a cheekbone . newline newline then he s leaning in closer . close enough that i can feel his hot breath on my neck . smell the sulfur off him . newline newline  i ll ask once more , holt .  he says .  who.wanted.me.dead ?  each word snarled a little more furiously than the previous once . newline newline i raise me head just a little bit . meet his eyes . stare deep into his black irises . a smile dances across my lips . newline newline  fuck . you .  newline newline                        newline newline he left me to the torturer . newline newline he s long gone . a few hours . i ve just been sitting here watching as the horribly twisted , greenskinned creature moves from my back to my arms . from my arms to my torso . the pain s completely unlike anything i ve ever felt before . a different level . i m pretty sure it has something to do with the runes engraved on the little iron knife he s using . newline newline then something weird happens . newline newline my eyes are shutting . the exhaustion getting the better of me . before sleep can claim me , though , i feel the torturer sawing at the rope that s holding me to chair . newline newline my body moves as if on autopilot . i stand as quickly as i can . steady myself against the nearby trolley  the one holding the torturer s equipment  so i do nt topple , and then cast my eyes back at the monstrous thing with the knife . he s hunched over , practically on all fours , his head bowed . newline newline i open my mouth to speak . find my throat parched . raw . newline newline  we serve the same master !  the torturer says , not daring to meet my eye . newline newline  you ve been cutting at me for hours .  i reply . i d shout it if i could , but i ca nt . newline newline  had to make it authenticlooking . never know when a patrol could come by and check in one me ! sorry !  newline newline i snatch the blade from his hands . take the underside of his chin in one of my hands and yank his eyes up to meet mine . i touch the blade to his now exposed throat . newline newline  tell me where he sleeps .  i growl .  and you ll leave with your life .  newline newline  out the door ! along the corridor ! two lefts and a right , then up the stairs ! i m so sorry !  the little misshapen beast caws . i feel a little bit of pity for him . a little pity that s outweighed by an intense hate . but still , pity , too . newline newline i leave him there . i m pretty sure he curls up into a ball and weeps once i let him go . i do nt particularly care . newline newline the corridor beyond the room i was held in is deserted . so are the ones leading toward the devil s chambers . it strikes me as odd . surely there should be guards here ? i mean there have been before , the other times i ve come . newline newline but then , if my employer has someone so deeply ingrained as the torturer , it would nt be too much of a stretch that he s got some guards on his payroll as well . newline newline i limp my way there . limp through the corridors . limp up the stairs . my blood leaking from a thousand wounds of varying sizes . i m leaving a trail as i go . if i do nt finish this soon i ll pass out . newline newline it d be just my luck . newline newline the devil s door is as unguarded as the corridors . a massive , wrought iron thing . screaming faces and other things of that nature stare out at me through hollow , dead eyes . engraved upon the door . newline newline i push it open , and it swings wide without so much as a squeak . crouching low , i move as quickly as i can into the darkened room beyond the door . newline newline he s lying in his bed , tossing and turning , but asleep . looks almost innocent . almost at peace . i raise the little knife high above my head and plunge the thing into his chest when he s still enough . stake the bastard right through the heart . newline newline his eyes snap open , flash angrily for a second or two . then he realises what s happening . realises he s dead . his hands shoot out to wrap themselves around my neck . he fights me for a moment . newline newline then they still . his whole body stills . he s gone . newline newline i expected it to be harder . newline newline i slide to the floor . sit slumped against the side of his fourposter bed . i can hear the pounding of heavy boots approaching the bedchamber . newline newline i take a breath . tighten my hand around the knife . just a moment to rest . newline newline my eyelids feel heavy . begin to shut . newline newline just one moment newline newline newlinei d read about them ... the otherlanders . what a nice story it had been . a man lost in between reality and technology who is stalked by a large short rotund and an eerily tall elegant thin . how nice this story is i had mused , what creativity it brings . newline newline the story never left me though . some thing about it became pegged to the back of my brain . sitting there . watching . i went back to my normal life , but some part of me stayed aware . i did nt realize it until the second or third time .  oh hey , look at that fat little man and that tall skinny man , that reminds me of the otherlanders  i had been so ignorant . it continued though . everywhere i went i began to notice their embodiment . in women , men , couples , creatures , but never acquaintances ... i never recognized them . just their size relation . i d never re  see them after i stole a glance , but they would return . walking through a brewery hand in hand , making a delivery in the field i was working , sitting at the movies , riding bikes in the street , the birds in the windows , squirrels in the tree . always there ! always 2 . what did they want ? this could nt be coincidence anymore ? newline newline what had the story been about ? i tried to find the story again , but there was no trace , no similar tales anywhere online or in libraries ... it began to eat at me ... what had the man haunted by these creatures wanted ? needed ? loved ? what did he ... fear ? newline newline newline newline newline i resolved to speak with them today . i have never tried to . i m standing in the middle of the feild waiting for 1 short rotund and tall elegant to invade my presence . to observe or follow me . the wind ruffles the cheat grass and sagebrush around me . i can here the highway rumbling over the hill side behind me as i scan the plains ... newline newline  hello elat  newline newline they stood before me ... i saw no footprints in the sand indicating there approach . i reeled in fear , but noted the tall thin regally boned man in front of me dressed in a tight pinstripe suite next to a small man with a bowler cap and portly mustachio attempting to hide parts of his bulbous face . the mustachio was failing ... newline newline  how ? how do you know my name ?  newline newline  elat das , this is your name ?  newline newline  why are you following me ? why were you following him ? i know you are otherlanders !  newline newline they turned their heads together in puzzlement . newline newline  are we ? we have been following you yes . yes indeed , for quite somewhile  newline newline  why ? what do you want ! ? i ca nt take this anymore ! if you re going to kill me just do it ! i ca nt live my life in your shadows anymore !  newline newline sweat dripped down my brow into the sand and i tried to fight the tears that began to break out and leak down from the corners of my eyes . newline newline  i just ... ca nt do it anymore  newline newline  surely elat das we would never harm you , we simply want you to remember . remember why we follow those we do . what it is we want from them . from you .  newline newline my brain reeled back to the story . i had tried a million times to remember the reason . how many nights behind locked doors had i tried ? how many conversations had i missed lost in my own thought over that very question ? how distant did all my friends and family become the longer i asked it ? this is nt my life ... newline newline  i want my life back !  newline newline  good , where did it go ?  only the tall thin man spoke now . newline newline  you ca nt ...  newline newline it hit me like a wave . i remembered he was a coma victim he ... newline newline what is that light ? newline newline why is my mouth so dry ? ? newline newline  oh my god ! everyone he is waking up everyone . can you here us ? son , my boy are you there ?  newline newline  oh my goodness , sweetie can you hear me ? you have been out for 3 months ? they tried to call off our wedding  newline newline  girls let him breath , he is probably disoriented  newline newline i opened my eyes . my family and fiance stood at the side of my bed . the light was bright here ... i could see a doctor in the corner . 2 . one was very tall , a female with perfect facial features and a large pronounced nose . the other ... the second was a male nurse , fairly heavy set and hairy , but tan and of a handsome construction . newline newline i watched them leave the room and heard the female whisper to the nurse as they closed the door ... newline newline  one less sad tale  newline newline edit : bad cell servicespellingthey say that revenge is a dish best served cold . newline newline i say it s a dish best left uncooked . newline newline my name is tom . now i do nt mean to bore you , but my life is pretty mundane . newline newline normal name ? check . newline newline quite a lazy guy ? check . newline newline not many ambitions ? checkmate . newline newline my day s are spent lounging around the house . i nap a lot . i guess we all love a nap , but i ve made it an artform . i also love to drink milk . ca nt get enough of the stuff . sometimes i even spice it up and slip in a little whiskey , you know , behind the scenes . newline newline but mostly my life is pretty normal . sleeping , eating , sleeping some more . you get the drift . newline newline ysee , things did nt used to be like this . things used to be so much more frustrating . so much more difficult newline newline a little guy used to invade my house . yeah , i know what you re thinking  rude huh ? every day this guy would sneak in . any way he could , any nook or cranny . he d sneak in to my house and eat my food . at first , i sort of shrugged it off . but it kept up , kept happening . so i could nt help it  i confronted him . newline newline the little bastard just laughed . he had this chuckling , mocking kinda laugh for such a little fella . it bothered me . newline newline not sure how it started , but we ended up playing these games with each other . he d sneak in and i d track him down to confront him . then he started leaving little devices , traps , distractions . things got intense , sometimes . i really started to hate that little bastard . newline newline i started trying all sorts of tricks . i barred the doors and he d sneak past them , through little holes . i left traps for him but he d spring them on purpose and leave me with that strange little laugh . i d come up with elaborate schemes and he d shrug em off . newline newline then , as we got older , time took its toll on the little fella . he slowed down , got lazy . i was bigger than him , stronger too . it never used to matter when we both had energy . he d been too fast , too smart . the little twerp . newline newline but one day , when he was an older guy and his wits were slow , i d seen him in my house again . he moved much slower , heard much less . he was creeping across the floor . without giving it much thought , i pounced on him  expecting him to dart out the way and leave me with that damn laugh . newline newline nope . newline newline he d been crushed under me . his little body snapping under my weight . shoulda laid off the milk . this little fucker , the source of my frustration for years was totally still , crumpled on the kitchen floor . i looked down and him and felt a wave of sadness just hit me like bang . i prodded him a bit , hoping he d be faking it like he had so many times . newline newline still nothing . newline newline tears welled up in my eyes and i had to turn away from that tiny , broken body . newline newline that was a couple years ago . like i said , life now is pretty easy . sleep , milk , sleep , repeat . i ve got it made here . good house , good owners . newline newline everything a cat could want . newline newline but sometimes , really late at night when i m just nodding off to my eighth sleep of the day , i can hear a noise on the edge of my hearing . newline newline sounds kinda like a tiny little mouse , laughing at me . newline hurgh !  newline newline a mostly clear , yellowish torrent spilled out of my gaping maw onto the creature s head . the only thing that made the situation slightly more dignified for all involved was that its nictating membranes closed just before the concoction of bile and stomach acid could cause an unpleasant stinging . newline newline i quickly turned aside , and motioned with what i hoped was an easily understood gesture of apology mixed with distress , and heaved once more . damn , i usually do nt have this level of gastric distress until ten hours after getting this plastered . part of my alcohol addled brain burbled something about radiation , but that was surely foolishness . newline newline the being in front of me  at least two feet shorter than me , with greybrown leathery skin and large eyes the color of roasted chestnuts  began wiping itself down , what i could see of its face wearing a mask that on a human would indicate disgust and mild embarrassment . it chittered something in a clicking language that i could nt understand  well , until i suddenly had the mother of all hangover headaches , like a sledgehammer between the eyes . right then , i could make out ... not words , but the impression of language . if i could put into some kind of actual words , it would be like why is it always puke ?  newline newline  hey man ... uh , maam ... er , guy ... i mean , your the one who all close encountering  barely two blocks from the pub on a weekend . i mean , be glad it s not piss , i guess .  newline newline thank  ancestral deity  for that , i suppose .  that was a little clearer . newline newline  are you ... like in my head ?  i m not the brightest bulb after two in the morning . newline newline no , i m up your ass . i thought i was close to one of your centers of higher learning .  newline newline  higher learn ... oh like , university ? i mean , yeah , i take classes there , but man ... er , whatever newline newline   man  is fine  dude   newline newline  ... right ... anyway , you picked , like , the worst time , it s right after exams , and i think i m fairly , um , representative of everyone s condition ...  though , come to think of it , i was feeling a lot more coherent than i d have normally expected ... newline newline yeah , trying to sober you apes up is a bitch sometimes , what with all the introspection and shit . bottom line , i need someone who knows the finer points of quantum entanglement . you the right monkey ?  newline newline  quantum whazzit ? dude ,  i pointed at myself  business major .  newline newline the little guy threw his head back and emitted a high pitched tone . newline newline for fuck s sake . where are the guys with thick ocular enhancement implements ? i do nt need an investment strategy , i need a friggin  ansible .  then , almost ... well , not inaudibly , but with less intensity , what i would nt give for one of those for real ...  newline newline  uh , i think there s a bunch of engineering grad students back at molly s ...  newline newline great , i guess that will do . do nt bother telling me where  molly s  is i felt something that i can only describe as a straw in my consciousness i ll get that myself . oh , feel free to tell your friends ! if you want to wind up in the nuthouse that is ... serves you right , chimp .  newline newline a bright light , and i passed out . newline newline                    newline newline i felt cold water on my face , and opened my eyes to my roommate looking at me with obvious concern .  what are you looking at ?  we were nt on the best of terms . newline newline he scowled .  you ve been out since you collapsed on this couch , yesterday . normally i d let you rot here , but i need a ride .  he made a funny face .  also , who s , ah zrrgl  ?  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  maybe you should look in the mirror .  newline newline i clambered up and went to the bathroom . looking in the mirror , my face was a mural of all the best  passed out at a party  cliches , dicks on my forehead , all kinds of stupid shit . the kicker was a stylized drawing of a little dude with a big head holding it s ... member , i guess ? ... and pissing in my mouth , with the caption  zrrgl wuz here . in these troubled times , there are many creatures to fear . some are the terrifying beasts we have long heard of in myths and legends . others were too insane for humane beings to imagine , and one glimpse at their forms induced incurable madness . and yet others still seemed harmless at first , yet proved to be some of the most dangerous of all . the party porpoise falls in that last category . newline newline what makes the party porpoise so feared is that it does nt just kill you in a terrible way . no , it takes something we all used to love and twists it into something horrible . the party porpoise , when it first appeared , seemed friendly . the floating cetacean , always wearing a party hat , would appear at anything that could be considered a party . it would promise to keep the party going . and it did . oh , god , how it did . a neverending party gets old quickly . the party porpoise s boom box entices you to dance for weeks on end . the only respite is when you drop dead from exhaustion . at first , rescue forces wearing earplugs would attempt to get people away from the sound , but the party porpoise would turn up the volume until it could pierce even the best earplugs . there is no hope for its victims , and protocol for a party porpoise appearance is to evacuate everyone within a five mile radius . newline newline there are no longer parties , or celebrations , or gatherings . they re too risky with that fiend , the party porpoise , out there .in the movies and books doctor strom had read , cryosleep was supposed to be instantaneous . one moment you are being put on ice , the next you wake up again . while relatively untested , this was the general consensus in the scientific community too . this was incorrect . the only experience she had to compare this to was sleeping after a particularly lively holiday party . you sleep hard , but there are certainly intermittent moments of sheer terror when your brain wakes up just a little bit . these moments , however infrequent , make the freeze anything but instantaneous . also , much like the 2009 caltech lab christmas party , you wake up feeling like you have a swarm of agitated wasps in your skull . newline newline doc strom knew every detail of all 22 stages of the unfreezing process . once the initial 120 day thaw had reached expected levels , an adulterant chemical was added to the cryofluid . a battery backup would hum to life and increase oxygen in the patient s brain . over the course of another month , various chemicals would be introduced into the patient to slowly reawaken them . she must be at the sucrose stage , she thought remembering her own procedure quite well . she only had a few days left before the necromancer  team  as they called them at caltech  would remove her from the dark tank and greet her back to the land of the living . newline newline doc counted the minutes . if all went well , it would be 5 years exactly from the day that herself and her team of 4 research students began the first human cryo trial . she excitedly wondered what advances in medicine had occurred . she wondered what her friends and parents were doing . she wondered if they had finally released halflife 3 . newline newline something was wrong , however . it had to have been 4 days since she had regained consciousness . that was far too long for the unfreezing procedure . the dark void was not a place she wanted to spend much time . nervously , she began to will her leg and arm muscles to move . at first , just a twitch , but after a day or two of effort her legs were able to touch the side of the chamber . a few more hours and she was banging on the side . she did this for what seemed like days . she wondered how long the wake up  nutrients would sustain her . newline newline and all went dark again .  newline newline there was a crash , a sudden sense of vertigo , a blinding light . newline newline again , doc fell asleep newline newline a distant thrumming . blurry figures . murmurs . eyes refocusing . newline newline it was the smell that hit doctor strom first . like smelling salts , the scent of powerful incense masking extreme body odor hit her . she felt like vomiting , but had nt eaten since her last meal at in and out . her eyes slowly refocused . newline newline four men in dark robes stood before her . smoke and dust filled the air , lights from stained glass windows above her shined down , making pillars of colorful light . it appears that caltech s research labs had undergone a bit of a redesign in these last five years . it was difficult to make out much more than that through the smoke and darkness . newline newline these men , they were speaking in unison their voices combining and echoing to sound like some great brass instrument . doc realized that she was lying on some kind of altar , covered in cloth . remnants of the cry01 pod were placed neatly around her , as if she had been hatched from some metallic egg . newline newline doc attempted to vocalize her confusion , but after not speaking for 5 years , the only noises that came from her were guttural and malformed . newline newline there was what sounded like a group of people hollering and gasping from behind the four chanting men . they parted and a fifth man , dressed in ornate purple robes stepped through them to observe her . he then turned to the crowd . newline newline  as it was written ! an angel has fallen . the first sign of the end times .  newline newline the four men began to chant again . newline newline crap , she thought there s no way i m getting halflife 3 nowit s hell , sitting here staring down the barrel of this gun . i can see it , the rifling , twisting . my eyes flick lazily to the sight , then down to the fingers on the grip , then to the face of the person holding it . newline newline  you gon na say it , or do i got ta say it ... ?  i ask . newline newline  shut up ,  she hisses , hand starting to shake a little . these chains are tight , real tight . damn things are biting into my skin . this is not a good night , not at all . first , i get the call that there s a god damn la gomera undead in damned san francisco of all things .  shut up , mark . shut the fuck up .  newline newline she s crying , crying a lot . it s not pretty , looking at my sister like this . monster hunters . we re supposed to be monster hunters , the best damn monster hunters out there . we can do anything together . newline newline except what i need most right now . newline newline even we ca nt do that . newline newline  sis , you got ta say it . say it , or you ll regret saying nothing . cold emptiness is going to do nothing but fuck you up in the head .  newline newline the bite hurt like hell . newline newline god damn fire . civilians trying to play hero , throwing damned molotovs . god , these fuckin  chains . god , this fuckin  bite . it ca nt possibly hurt any worse , it s a burning throbbing ache and it smells like a cess pool . newline newline  i do nt want to say it !  she shouts , taking the gun off my face . i raised her . parents dead when she was six years old . i was sixteen . got a job , brought her up . found out about monster hunting , and together we got into the game . made money , got ourselves set up nice and rich . got guns , got body armor . newline newline but the fire burned a damned hole in my pants leg . burned the flesh too . some god damned zed got a fuckin  well cooked meal . sealed pants leg and it burned right through because zombies are nt supposed to use fire , they never are . not even the mutated fuckers , they use acid at worst . newline newline  someone s got to say it . we treat each other ... like siblings do , and we fight all the time , but you got ta say this sis ... someone s got to , or you re going to ... lose it . this world ca nt lose you , no way , not the best damn hunter i ve ever seen . say it while i m still here sis .  newline newline  no ! no , god damn it ! what if someone ... finds a way , a ... a cure ! ?  newline newline  they ai nt gon na do it in the next ten minutes . look at the wound ... i can smell it , and ... i bet i m in stage two ,  i tell her , taking a shuddering breath . heat feels like it s in my head now . god damn it s hard to focus ... blurry vision ... shit .  this is ... la gomera shit , sis ... no cure , no treatment ...  newline newline she s sobbing so hard now . the worst part is by the time we noticed i was already losing control of my body ... ca nt hold a gun , or i d blow myself away ... only a registered hunter can execute a living infected person ... guards all around , outside the quarantine room ... newline newline  i do nt ... god damn it , i do nt want to say it ! you say it !  newline newline  put the gun against my head . i ll say what you need to say , or hear , and as soon as i m done ... you pull the trigger ,  i manage , breathless .  i ai nt got much time and i wan na die with some sort of dignity . you got ta do this before i turn .  newline newline  bro , i ...  newline newline  what are we , sis ?  i demand . god damn it , i can feel it , parasitic fucking things ... hurts ... vision is getting reddish about the edges ... damn ... newline newline  hunters , but  newline newline  why do we do the job ! ?  newline newline  because ... because ...  newline newline need to hurry this up . ca nt turn . she sees me like that it ll cripple her mentally against all such ... fucking things in the future ... newline newline  why do we do the job ! ? tell me !  i shout hoarsely . newline newline  because it has to be done !  she roars in reply . newline newline  and ! ?  newline newline a moment of silence . newline newline  and because we like it . because we have no other skills . because we re ... because someone has to do it , and ... because if we do nt , people die .  newline newline  now ... now , knuckle up , shoot me , and then go home to your girlfriend and cry . take a few weeks off , hate everything a while , then move on , got it ?  newline newline another long silence . heart beating wrong ... this pain , all down my left arm . she wo nt look me in the eye . newline newline her hand is still shaking when she points the pistol at my face . her other hand rises to check her hazmat mask and goggles , to make sure they re sealed . the barrel touches my forehead ... shit , i have one hell of a fever , it feels like ice ... newline newline  say it , then . say it for me . i always had trouble saying ...  newline newline her feelings . therapy helped but she still ai nt good at talking about emotions . but i know here like the back of my hand . i know what she feels . newline newline  you love ... me . you hate me for leaving you alone , just like mom and dad did . you forgive me for the bullshit . i love you too , sis , i surely do . oh , and as much as we fight , and you think i m a jacka  i m cut off by a cough , a hacking cough . blood flecks my pantlegs . stage three ... fever , red vision , uncontrollable coughing , he ... hemo ... hemopt ... coughing up blood .  the point is , you re going to miss me ... when i m gone ...  newline newline her finger is tightening on the trig newline newline  hm . tried . ehn . it s been a long day . newline newline oh , sure , he s used to days like this . a lot of his job , honestly , is sitting around waiting for these little fudgenuggets to get home already . people who are nt in the business do nt understand how boring it can be . if he had to describe it to someone , which he never would , he would describe it as being like a lava lamp exploding . sometimes , you can hear the glass cracking before everything goes boom , but there s really only 1 second where anything exciting happens . but there s a terribly long wait for things to heat up , and there s such an obnoxious clean up afterward , if it takes you by surprise . really , one has to be a saint to be an assassin . newline newline this job is atypical it s not some political prick stuffed asshole , this time . it s just a guy who own a restaurant . a disgruntled employee who wants to see his former boss dead the whole time he was talking to the kid who hired him he just wanted to stop and say  kid , shut up , you re an oversensitive nitwit , grow up ,  but , ehh , paycheck and all that . newline newline climbing down from his hiding place in the office to stretch his legs , he circles the desk . it s a rather neat desk , for all he ca nt really see it . the computer is nt ancient , but it is nt new either . small stacks of papers are piled neatly on the left corner of the desk , organized alternately by staples or paper clipped together . the mug filled with pens says  caffeine container  on it . bleh . newline newline he sighs , looking out the window . all he can see is the parking lot . he seriously considered waiting until later to b  e , but the later you wait to enter , the more likely you are to get caught breaking in by a neighbor . better safe than in jail . newline newline he knows that no one is going to be showing up for some time , so he decides to snoop on the unfortunate soul . his desk is very business oriented . devoted almost entirely to official office things . a good thing for a boss to do , but painfully dull to pass the time with . newline newline he s about to wander into the kitchen area to grab a snack of some kind when he hears something thump in the drawer he just closed . actually digging into it this time , rather than just glancing , he finds a phone . newline newline god , it s such a blast from the past . it looks like a shitty early2000 s phone , with an lcd screen comparable to a gameboy . he knows a couple drugdealing guys who have phones like these for business you buy the shitty phone that has a very limited number of minutes on it that you can hide from people , since the phone is shite anyway and you can ditch it whenever . you avoid anyone knowing about your shady dealings on your real phone and you re out , what , 20 bucks ? 50 , max ? maybe he should invest in one . then again , he generally sets up his appointments online , and he does nt want another chatty , bitchy brath mcgee , but ... newline newline the phone is still advanced enough to text , if barely , so he decides to occupy his time by flipping through old conversations . it would seem that the guy used this phone to communicate with one person , and one person only . the most recent conversation went like this : newline newline  friday , nov. 14 newline newline  hi , honey newline newline  babe , u cumin 2 c me after work ?  newline newline  hav 2 go pick up wife so no newline newline  d  :  newline newline  im sorry newline newline  ill make it up 2 u on ur bday this monday   newline newline  okay :   newline newline  luv u !  newline newline  this phone is about to run out of minutes newline newline  ill buy another one and text u on sun ok ? newline newline  why wait so lang ?  newline newline  anniversary on sat newline newline  i think she suspects sumthin so i have to do really good newline newline  i hope u think of me when ur with her newline newline  i will newline newline  no question newline newline  got ta go newline newline well , this boring guy just got more interesting . he has fun imagining different scenarios of how his weekend went to pass the time . being the singleminded workaholic he is , he naturally has the entire scenario turn south . the wife waits until they re in a fancy restaurant to show him evidence of his cheating . he still , stupidly , denies it . heads begin to turn as they argue louder and louder , her demanding a divorce on the spot from him and him not admitting a thing . eventually , the head waiter comes over and asks then to leave  they re disturbing the other patrons . except they re not , it s prime live entertainment for the stuck up yuppies at this place , who rubberneck at the fighting couple until they re out the door , out of sight , and out of mind . newline newline they do nt stop fighting once they re outside , either she s hitting him , just hitting him , more crying than yelling anymore , begging him to tell her what she did wrong . nothing he ll say , you did nothing wrong , but it s the wrong answer , it s always the wrong answer because something obviously is nt working between them . she ll sit on the curb and cry because she does nt understand , and he ll stand by awkwardly and watch what disaster he has wrought , wondering if he should just run away . newline newline or maybe , maybe his wife was less sympathetic . maybe she s a raging bitch who has been wasting all his hard earned money on stupid things . a  former ?  trophy wife who s getting on in years , a gold digger who could care less about the man and more about what s in his pants , be it his dick or his wallet . they d go shopping before they eat , and she d drag him around by her gravitational pull as he carried all her new clothes , new makeup , new phone , new everything , and he smiles and smiles and puts up with it because he knows that she ll use it never and he cam lavish all these items on someone he knows will love it for real , later . when his wife goes to sleep that night , he ll leave and take 75  of the stuff they just bought to his new girl s place and just ... stay . forever . newline newline maybe , on saturday , he comes home from work to a full cooked meal and a smiling wife , all hungry from working so hard  or fucking the new girl  there really is nt a difference is there , someone is getting fucked  . what he does nt know is that his wife put some date rape drugs in his portions , and he slowly grows more and more tired as they sit and cuddle together on the couch as they watch the movie . she offers to drag him to bed , but she does nt . she leads him to the garage , where there s a drain she can wash out easily , and bashes his head in with a hammer . or maybe she situates him in the car , turns it on , and leaves him . there s just so many possibilities , he grins stupidly and ca nt stop himself . newline newline he crawls back up into his hiding place , still grinning like a fool , waiting for the early morning to come . he has a very finite amount of time to kill the guy and get out before any other employees show up , if any time at all . he may have to wait until closing . but he s willing to wait . because he s a saint compared to these people . and now he has all these wonderful stories he can keep himself occupied with until he sees him . newline newline he ll be waiting a long time . he ll never know just how right he was . newline newline   any commentscriticismfeedback is appreciated !  the shadows grew taller until they reached into my room , and the light of the world faded around me . i sat motionless in the dark , and a sorrowful breath escaped my lips . newline newline i fucked up again . newline newline i thought she would be different . sure , i might have came across as a bit shy , but who does nt ? i caught her smiles so many times i could nt even count , each one unique like a snowflake . she sent me winks , compliments and wishes  which i tried my best and more to try and fulfill them . newline newline but i was wrong . newline newline maybe i had read it wrong , or maybe she did nt know me  either way , i was once again banished to the realm of the forsaken friendzone , with nothing but a cold emptiness emanating from my heart . newline newline the thunder flashed outside , startling me slightly . newline newline terrific .  i thought . newline newline it seemed that even the weather was bringing me down . newline newline there was another flash , but this time , i did not hear the thunder . instead , i heard whispers that entered my ears like some slimy snake , leaving an unpleasant feeling in my mind . my teeth clenched as i realized i had heard this before , but i could not remember when . what was it ? was it during the 14th birthday ? was it during last christmas ? what was it ? newline newline as if to answer my question , something black and dusty exploded in front of me , causing me to be blown back into my bed . newline newline the figure materialized steadily , and i could make out image through the silhouette . it was a woman , wearing a dark pointed hat , with hair black as a street cat s , with a robe that unified the colors . newline newline she blinked , her blue , hollow eyes glowing in the dark , and then shifted her gaze on me . i had barely enough time to recover myself when she stormed in front of me and grabbed me by the shirt . newline newline  you !  she shrieked . an explosion of black smoke hissed out of her mouth as she spoke . newline newline  wwhat ?  i stammered . i raised my hands in a surrendering gesture , but it had little effect . newline newline  we had a deal !  newline newline  who are you ?  i asked . newline newline she was then silent  but only for a split second . to my surprise , she released me , and clicked her fingers . in an instant , a piece of paper materialized in front of her . newline newline  four years ago . december the fifth . at the party .  she stated . newline newline i carefully took the paper from her slim , bony hands , and looked over it cautiously . i was surprised to find that i could read the letters quite accurately , despite being in the dark . newline newline my face changed to confusion when i realized what the paper had said . i was to promise her me firstborn , in exchange for musical talent . trying my best not to offend her , even taking into consideration that she may be offended by the way i looked at her , i extended the paper back to her . she snatched it without a word . newline newline  i do nt understand .  i said in my best feeble voice . newline newline  you promised me your firstborn !  she shrieked again . the room was getting darker each time her mouth was open . newline newline  i did !  i protested . newline newline  it s not my fault i ca nt get any girls !  newline newline i clenched my teeth at my protest , as i had put in more passion to the tone without realizing it . to my surprise however , the witch was taken back . newline newline  wait what ?  she asked . newline newline i sighed , and showed her computer . newline newline  look .  i pointed . newline newline the witch peered at the screen with narrowed eyes , and began scrolling through my chat log . i did not bother reading it again , and instead found entertainment in her reactions . her face changed from a dreamy smile , to a raised eyebrow , to an approving look , to a grimace . she then looked at me , and scratched her head . newline newline  in five years , she s the only one you ve been talking to ? i mean , there has to be others right ?  she asked . newline newline i sighed again , but added a shrug . newline newline  but ... why ?  she asked me . newline newline i opened my mouth to speak  my intended answer was to be something melancholy and gentlemanly , but i closed my mouth . i felt a strange anger bubble out from inside me , and i felt the cork pulverize into dust as the fiery emotions exploded out into verbal form . newline newline  i do nt fucking know !  i shouted . newline newline the witch was more taken back then before , and this time it was her turn to collapse on my bed . newline newline  i mean , i m not even that bad looking right ?  i looked at her with eyes of anger , rather than of desperation . newline newline the witch gulped and nodded . her eyes then caught the bottle of liquor next to my monitor . newline newline  i mean , i m a nice guy , i do nt treat woman badly  hell i do nt even insult them !  i carried on . i felt my face turn red , but i refused to believe it was the alcohol . newline newline  but what happens ? nothing ! absolutely goddamn nothing ! i asked twenty three girls out  after getting to know them , know their favorite colors , their hobbies , their favorite movies , their favorite music  hell , i even found a girl that likes heavy metal like me , and what happens ? nothing !  newline newline the witch nervously stood up and began muttering something under her breath . newline newline  i even skipped going out to my friend s birthday party to hang with this other chick by the way , and she just told me that she wanted to be friends . it s always with the friendship ! she s got a million friends on facebook for crying out loud !  newline newline the witch began fading into black smoke , but it was slow . she began muttering faster , while looking at me and nodding with a static look . newline newline  hell , if she wanted friends she should be a goddamn carebear ! i ve wasted so much of my time doing this  i do nt even know if   newline newline i never finished my rant , as i was interrupted by another loud explosion of smoke , to which i was knocked back from my chair . i thumped my head hard on the desk and i cursed , grasping at the back to ease the pain . newline newline i looked up to see the witch , but she was gone . newline newline i sighed for the third time , and rose to my feet . the light flickered , and were illuminated again , lighting the darkness of my room . and with a weak stumble , i collapsed into the chair and stared back at the monitor . newline newline and once again , i surrendered my eyes to the internet world , and my mind switched off as warriors , gangsters , cats , girls and cartoons flashed past me , easing the pain of my defeat .the great seal shattered in a flickering explosion of darkness . all was still as he peered into the exposed chamber . newline newline he stayed perfectly still for one long , immeasurable moment . many eyes watched the back of his head intently . he could almost taste the anticipation in the air . newline newline  my dear friends ,  he paused ,  the evil one is dead .  newline newline pandemonium broke out behind him . in the darkened cavern there were gathered a thousand sorcerors , warlocks and witches of the old age of blood and dark . with one simple sentence , he d thrown their ranks into chaos . any minute now , if nothing changed , there would be a bloodbath as magics of a variety unseen in any battle heretofore would be slung around by a thousand angry people . newline newline a thousand little marionettes , dancing to his tune . the combined power to conquer a kingdom ready to tear itself apart at his whim . newline newline beneath his golden mask , his eyes slitted with satisfaction . a nearly rapturous sigh flowed inaudibly down his throat at the thought . he raised his golden staff and a crackle of lightning slammed into the centre of the cavern with a loud bang . he allowed it trace its way back to him , surrounding him in a golden corona of energy before dispersing it all at once . newline newline a cold , dead silence fell among the ranks . newline newline  my friends , dear friends , do you think we are thwarted ? do you , perhaps believe that all hope is lost ? that the blood and dark we have worked for for centuries will never come to be ?  newline newline he could taste the resentment in the air . he did nt even need to see their faces . he turned back to the opened chamber , smiling at the bones inside . newline newline  this is the great evil one  we have all placed our hopes on . look . feel . is he truly worth the respect we have honoured him with ? is he truly the strongest to so easily falter in the service of blood and dark ?  newline newline  have some respect , you elfling bastard !  newline newline a sorceror strode forward , the crowd parting around him like water . he was a tall , broadshouldered human man . an ermine cloak whipped about his shoulders and a great shield of obsidian covered his arm . angrim , the auramancer of the sturmhold . newline newline how perfect . no doubt there were a significant number in the crowd who still believed as he did . he would make a good example . newline newline  respect ?  he tilted his head ,  have i not shown respect ? here i am ,  he spread his arms ,  respecting the strength of blood and dark . that this creature behind me has failed to hold true to the cause is certainly no fault of mine .  newline newline  you talk about strength ?  angrim growled ,  do you have strength then ? do you , a sorceror of not even a century s age , naively claim to be the strongest , the best to lead us into an age of blood and dark once more , in place of the evil one ?  newline newline he sighed . angrim was so easy to toy with it was almost a shame he had to end the man . his fingers twitched against the grooves of his staff . all good things must come to an end however ... he d been letting his marionettes run wild enough for one day . newline newline he spoke languidly ,  well , angrim of the sturmhold . do you think you can take me on ?  newline newline he admired the way the muscles jumped in the man s jaw . he drank in the flex of his fingers and the reddening shade of his face . newline newline is he going to leap ? is he really going to try me in front of all of them ? will he really be this foolish after he has seen me best the great seal singlehandedly ? newline newline all these thoughts filtered into his mind nearly simultaneously . he broke into a wide grin beneath his golden mask as the man broke into a charge . newline newline angrim was an impressive sorceror . he had lived for almost three centuries and in that time amassed a great army of golems to guard his tower in one of the most inhospitable parts of the world . regretfully , his strength came at the cost of one sure weakness . newline newline it had been an age since angrim had sparred with a sentient being . newline newline golden light flickered in his hands . angrim rushed towards him , a great beast of mist and energy forming behind him , its maw yawning towards him with the inevitability of a hurricane . he drew his staff as if about to call forth lightning again . angrim s expression changed into one of vicious triumph no doubt he knew that material attacks would not suffice against his aura beast . newline newline lightning poured out of the ceiling of the cavern , temporarily blinding the observers . he slashed out with a dagger , catching the man in the throat . before the sorcerors could recover from his flash of light , he called forth a torrent of lightning to incinerate angrim s body into a charred , indistinct mess . newline newline he stepped over it , not bothering to acknowledge the kill . newline newline  my friends , we have much work to do for the cause .  he spread his arms in a welcome gesture ,  shall we begin ?  newline newline a thousand little marionettes , dancing at his whim , and his whim only .killing is what i was born to do and power is what i lived for . i have killed to many people to count , i love it . it all started when i was 14 , just like the other boys in my class i started to get urges . but not the kind of urges one would expect from a pubertal 14 year old , it was nt until 3 years later that i myself realised it was the urge to kill . my first one was a lowlife that had been selling drugs around the neighbourhood , it was an easy pick . i felt extremely relieved by it , but after a few months that same feeling as before had been building up again . i had to do it once more . after my third i quickly realised it ca nt me going like this , i have to take action to control myself . to do the killing in a more planned and professional way . i did it by joining the police force , climbing my way up and eventually working for the fbi felt great . perfect for a person like me , i loved the power it gave me and the best of it was i could easily pick my targets , criminals that had gotten away were great victims . nobody cared about them . newline newline now i m old man , waiting for my death in a hospital , brain tumor . i m happy with my life , i m rich , i have a carrer , i have been able to live out my desires to the fullest . i know this i my last night , when i go to sleep tonight i will die , my body ca nt keep up with it anymore . newline newline  newline newline as i wake up i m in a light room , confused , first i thought i was still in the hospital but it ca nt be . something is off about this place , a figure appear in front of me and present itself as an angel .  i m an angel , i m suppose to guide you into god s hall  . shit , do nt tell me there is an actual god , i m going straight to hell for what i ve done . newline newline  hello , i ve been waiting for you  said the large man with a long beard infront of me .  i will stop wasting my time and be quick , i want to retire as god and wondered if you would take my place ?  . i replied  what ? why ? after all i have done ?  . god laughed , said  yes , that s exactly why . what you have done is great , you have dedicated your whole life to one thing , killing murderers , drug dealers and pedophiles . you have made the world a much better place than anyone has ever done before , you are perfect for the job !  . as a pscyhopath i have always wanted power , climbing in the police force was a great way of getting power . but could i have ever dreamed of this ? probably not . god continues  one common mistake is that death is the one taking poeples lifes , and bringing them to haven . but it s actually me , god , since you have a good taste in killing i  m sure you will do the job just fine.  .you could say that i am a collector , but by most definitions that would certainly not be the case . you see , most people collect things of a tangible nature : post cards of vacations , rocks from different places , my mother s silly coins we would search for at the market . unlike most people , however , i collect what no one else can . talents . newline newline in my first iteration , i was a merchant . i loved the bustle of the merchants , the calls of lower prices and better goods . haggling was my balancing act , my musical instrument . it took two to tango , as the saying goes , and the connection was like a fire in my soul . the people were what it was about . i amassed a great fortune , yet died alone . i begged for another chance which was answered in silence . newline newline i awoke from my deathbed the next morning in shock . had someone heard my prayer ? i thanked whoever was up there for a second chance , and fell to the task swiftly . i decided to forgo monetary gains and focus on family , on friends . this second chance was all i had hoped for  nights were filled with singing and laughter , i became a lover of music and stories . children performed nightly and we joyful , and on my deathbed i smiled and was content . newline newline i awoke from my deathbed yet again , confused as before . was i cursed ? i searched for my family , but they were long gone . i determined that i must build again what i had before , but with the lost of my first family , my heart was not in it . i became cold , and went back to the money . i became a skilled architect , with fame and fortune , and in the end i prayed this would be the last . newline newline i awoke from my deathbed . i awoke from my deathbed . i awoke from my deathbed . newline newline i can sample a wine and tell you the exact province and year . i can pick up any instrument and play various styles and genres . i can perform advanced mathematical proofs and study the stars . my collection is filled to the brim , but in truth it is the same as any other collection . it serves to remind me of times gone by , and unlike any other collection , i have no one to share it with . newline newline so i collect my talents , and lie down on my deathbed . newline newline newline newline edit : full disclosure , this is my first time really trying to write anything , and it was somewhat lazy . but i loved this prompt , thanks op you truly inspired me to try something for the first time . i d love thoughts on it , if it made sense at all what i was trying to convey .i was in the kitchen when i first heard the commotion break out , just disembodied voices tangled in frustration and anger . a glass broke , then a plate , then children started crying , full of distress and grief . newline newline i set down the dough i was kneading , wiped my hands hastily on my apron , then gingerly retrieved my fire stick from its hiding place and tucked it just under my belt . the cold steel against my flesh brought back memories i had fought so hard to leave behind , and my hands started trembling . newline newline outside , the first thing that caught my eye was the bright crimson , splashed all across the white tiles of my humble pizza parlor newline newline  sorry boss , i  ll get it all cleaned up . don  t you worry about a thing , just two kids fighting during dinner , that  s all.  jessica already had the broom and dishwipes in her hand , bless her heart . newline newline it seemed that the fracas was almost over . the two adults at the booth in question were still admonishing their children when the father met my eyes , and something about my ashen , stricken face must have gotten through to him . he apologized profusely , slammed money down on the table , then hauled his family out before i could react . newline newline the relief came in waves , so purifying that i almost crumpled on the floor . this was just children misbehaving , not a drug raid . there were no men in body armour , no vicious sniffing dogs , no threats of death looming just seconds away . newline newline on my knees next to jessica , picking up the slivers of broken china , i noticed that this family had hardly touched the 12inch they had ordered . briefly , a pang of regret at the wastage pricked my heart  this was not just pizza , this was an hour of my life . i recalled how the first few months learning was tough , and at times it seemed as if my pizza venture would never take off . either the crust would be too thick , or the dough too salty , or the toppings too cloying newline newline but i persevered , because i yearned for the day that customers would give me the same look of anticipation they had back when i was selling them packets of genie  s spit , or booming bass , or catfish delight , or any one of the hundred other concoctions on the menu . insatiable eyes , eager hands , hushed  thankyous  as money and product exchanged hands . newline newline i missed the satisfaction which came with that . newline newline i can  t recall when things changed , but perhaps it was that weekend a few months ago when i finally cranked out my first serviceable pie . it tasted right to me , and the passersby i handed out free samples to seemed to agree . everyone finished their slices , and no one threw theirs away . the warm sensations i felt , knowing that my two hands brought a moment  s respite to others , sated their appetites newline newline that accomplishment i felt then dwarfed all the other highs of my drugdealing career , beating out even that time i managed to slink right past customs with twenty blocks hidden in my car boot . it wasn  t an adrenaline rush , more a spreading , blossoming sense of having done something right . newline newline and that , i found , was all that mattered for me . newline newline the chimes on the front door rang , and i looked up to find that the father had returned , alone this time . he wrung his hands for a while , then approached me , trepidatiously . newline newline  hey , you the boss here ? sorry about all that , i hope i tipped enough for the mess.  newline newline  don  t worry about it ,  i said , smiling wanly .  anything else i can do you for ?  newline newline  actually yes . could i get another order , to go this time ? two hawaiian , with extra toppings ?  newline newline  er , mister , you sure ? jessica told me that your kids had refused to eat , fighting between themselves when you pressed them to finish their dinner . if pizza  s not their thing , maybe you might wan na get something else for th  newline newline he laughed then , a hearty chuckle which resonated through my bones . newline newline  oh no , no , you  ve got it wrong . they were fighting over who would get more slices ! it  s their second time here , and they  ve been asking for nothing else all week . we wanted to teach them a lesson by letting them go hungry but my wife , she  s the smart one , she said that why not just get two this time , make sure there  s more than enough to go around ?  newline newline he held out his palms , smoothened twenties between his fingers , a smile on his face . there was a look in his eyes which said that i would be seeing him again , soon . newline newline i had never rushed so quickly to fill an order before . newline newline   newline newline rrarelyfunnyit  s hard for me to describe the euphoric feeling i get when i come home from work and can finally take off that damned tie . it  s the first thing i do upon setting foot inside my door . my cat dog is always at the door , waiting for me to feed him . after a long day dealing with clients , who are never happy with the way their stupid logo looks , his happiness to see me is always welcome . newline newline upon feeding him and taking off my tie , i shed the rest of my suit . i hate wearing dress clothes . they are stiff and don  t ever fit right on me , the shoes always too small and the shirts too large . personally , i just like to wear sweat pants and a tee shirt , if i wear anything at all . who  s going to judge me ? my dog ? newline newline  newline newline after a long day at work , i am always immensely glad to see my cat when i walk through the door . he always is sitting on his chair , watching me , patiently waiting for me to kick off my heels at the door . after a long day testing video games in formal wear , the shoes feel more like foot prisons than something making me feel nice . newline newline i swiftly change into something far less formal . my cat is glad for me to feed her as always , showing her appreciation with a few happy meows before chowing down . i adjust my tshirt and look in the mirror . my hair is going in a thousanddifferent direction . but hey , who  s going to judge me ? my cat ? newline newline  newline newline i hate designing logo  s for start up  s . it  s terrible . these  businesspeople  never listen to my advice . no , green doesn  t go with red , unless it  s a company selling christmas products . all i want to do is sit here in front of my tv , with my xbox , having a little fun with a fantasy world . newline newline i look out my side window as i watch my game load , my dog at my feet , dreaming of his alternate life chasing cats . i can see my nextdoor neighbor in her office , her hair all askew . she appears to be drawing something . who would waste their free time on that ? why throw your life away ? newline newline i look back at my tv and shoot a few zombies . now this is the life ! newline newline  newline newline i hate playing video games for a living . it seemed to be fun when i first started , but now i just play bugridden messes that i can barely call a game . i sit down at my desk and pull out my pencils and paper . newline newline i look behind me and out the window , and see my neighbor sitting in front of his tv . he doesn  t look much better than the zombies he is shooting . i shake my head . who would want to play video games ! such a waste ! why throw your life away ? newline newline i turn back to my paper . now this is the life ! newline newline thanks for reading ! if you enjoyed this , be sure to check out more stories over at https : www.reddit.comrwrittentherapyprojectmore uneasy than being awoken by water is the feeling that you re being watched . after waking up twice within a day in such a way made my mind on edge and irrate . the feeling of being watched was different than the night before  the muggers  life energy i could sense coming from many lengths away , but now i could nt sense anything apart from the hawk making a fresh kill , or the dunefrog sipping from mildew forming on the dune s grass . but i was being watched  that much was clear . it annoyed me dearly , but after a few minutes i shook the feeling off and packed my scarce belongings for the trip to wecsile keep . newline newline that trip , ultimately , took me three hours . which was a lot , because i did nt encounter anything troublesome at all . i just kept walking the wrong way . now , wizards usually do nt have problems like this . it s often joked about how men ca nt read maps and that women do it better , but wizards kind of autonavigate as soon as they know where they need to go . suffice to say , my internal compass was apparently going haywire . yet again a ploy to keep me from being on my way ? what greeted me at the gates of the keep brushed that thought away , though . newline newline  hello valeria . handsome as ever , i see . now what would a mistress like you have to search in a place like this ?  newline newline the smile was so cold that the sweat on my forehead litteraly froze .  hello , master mcdouglass . still charming to the bone .  silence . i took the time to make a faux bow and brush the frost off of my forehead .  the pleasure is all mine . i was nt expecting an escort , especially not when i barge in unanounced , but now that you re here why do nt you give me a tour of the place ?  this time , the resulting stare did nt do much to throw me off balance , although the feeling you get when your blood tries to freeze , but is nt allowed to , ca nt be described as entirely pleasant .  i m afraid that my employer wishes you to not enter his keep and rather sees you leaving . even better , rather yesterday than today .  newline newline ah . that cleared up a lot . nonetheless , i was nt letting a wizardforhire stand between me and my means of getting off this island .  ah . yes , well , in that we both agree . you see , i had a rather unpleasant experience landing on this island , and i intend to leave as soon as possible  my business does nt entail ruffing up the local status quo . so ... please ?  yet again silence . it was at that point that i noticed the lapis lazuli behind her left ear . got to take that one up with the wizard s council ... when she spoke again , it was with less danger in her voice , but it was clear she still did nt trust me .  my employer , the mayor of wexalia , welcomes you in his home ... for now . he wishes to audience with you . at your behest and after you ve ... changed clothes , ofcourse .  that remark made me blush a bit . i had forgotten that the salt had bruised up my robe and other clothing pretty roughly .  ofcourse ,  i nodded .  please extend my thanks to his mayorship for allowing me into his home . now , if you ll excuse me ?  as i walked past valeria and into the keep , the scents of food and the bustling of civilization filled my ears . it was good to be under the people again ...i saw dr . slate approaching from down the hall , and shivered . newline newline his look was nt intimidating . a elderly gentleman , he wore a crisp suit , pressed shirt , impeccable tie . his shoes were polished , his gray hair was combed back . he could have been anyone . in fact , he was so nondescript it was almost uncanny . newline newline except for his eyes . i looked through him as he drew near so i would nt have to see them . i did nt want him to look at me , just in case . i would not be one of his patients . newline newline he nodded to me as he opened the door to my left . i looked straight ahead , saying nothing . i never said anything to dr . slate , and never would if i could help it . he paused in the doorway , looked at me pointedly , and said  good afternoon , darren .  i still said nothing , trying to shut my ears to his voice . i did nt want to hear it . his voice was for his patients . newline newline he sighed , and i could see his body sag , ever so slightly , out of the corner of my eye . newline newline  i m not a monster , you know . i m just a man . i m just doing my job .  newline newline i said nothing . newline newline he shook his head , just a little , and suddenly straightened up . after all , he did have a job to do . he stepped into the room , and the door clicked . newline newline i let out a breath and leaned on the wall behind me . that had nt been so bad , as encounters with dr . slate went . i had nt seen his eyes , and he had only said a few words . i did nt even have to sit in the viewing room today , so i would nt have to listen as he had his consultation . newline newline i had listened before . i never wanted to again . newline newline  newline newline of course it was my fucking day to be in the viewing room . we were on rotation , but darren had weaseled his way out of his shift again . something about ptsd or depression or some shit . like it was somehow worse for him than the rest of us . so now it was my turn to stand behind the glass and make sure everything went as planned . fucking great . newline newline i flinched slightly as the door clicked shut in the room . dr . slate strolled in and give a cheery  good afternoon !  to his  patient .  we were supposed to call the prisoners that . legal reasons or some shit . newline newline dr . slate settled into the free chair in the room . from my place at the window , i could see his aging face . he looked like the grandpa every kid wanted . this guy creeped me the fuck out . newline newline i tried not to see his eyes . newline newline  how are you feeling today ?  dr . slate asked the man in front of him . newline newline  how do you fucking think ?  the man replied . he knew what was happening . they all did . it was mysterious for a while , until nobody came back from their consultation . then it was obvious . we were nt just letting these people go , they were murderers , rapists , the scum of the earth . there was nt another prison , they were all overfilled already . even these people could do that kind of math . newline newline  yes , i realize you probably did nt choose to come here . but here you are , so we can only make the best of it . besides , i think you will agree this meeting with me is the best thing that has ever happened to you . you ll see .  newline newline god , i hated this guy . his voice was so ... reasonable . friendly . the kind of voice you naturally want to trust . newline newline  so ... chris , is it ?  newline newline i jumped through the fucking roof . did he just say my name ? but no , the prisoner s name was chris . it was chris . i remember somebody referring to him as chris ... newline newline i killed the audio to the room . maybe i had to watch , but i sure as shit did nt have to listen . newline newline i watched the consultation . now that i could nt hear dr . slate s voice , i was much more relaxed . he was nt getting in my head . not today . newline newline the prisoner , though . he was nt so lucky . chris became more and more animated as he spoke , gesturing as far as his cuffs allowed and shouting . dr . slate sat quietly , nodding and smiling slightly . his eyes never left his patient . newline newline eventually , chris calmed down . he settled back into his chair , looking exhausted . i flicked the audio back on . for whatever reason , dr . slate s closing remarks had a kind of sick fascination for me . the way he knew exactly what to say to push them over the edge . newline newline  chris , i know you ve had a hard life . i m sorry to hear about what happened between you and jessica . you say that if it was nt for her , you would nt be here , and i think that s the truth , chris . you probably wo nt believe this , but i think you re a good guy . i bet she regrets all those things she said to you .  newline newline  she does nt . that bitch has nt written me a single letter since i landed in this shithole . and it s been 15 years .  newline newline  maybe not yet . but ...  he leaned in conspiratorially .  i know the perfect way you can get back at her . right here , from prison . and it wo nt even be hard .  newline newline  what should i do ?  chris asked . that poor sonuvabitch . he was asking dr . slate for advice . he was done . newline newline instead of answering , dr . slate lifted a briefcase from under the table and set it down , facing his patient . he clicked the latch and it opened smoothly . inside , nestled snugly in black velvet , was a gun . newline newline  what is this for ?  chris asked hesitantly . newline newline  think about it , chris . you have a life sentence . you will spend the rest of your life here . it s jessica s fault , you said so yourself . you know what that means , chris ? that means if you stay here , locked up , letting the years slip away as you slowly age and die ... if you stay here , this place that she put you , this place where you have no freedom , no control ... it means jessica wins .  newline newline his eyes . it was his fucking eyes that made this whole thing work . full of compassion , understanding , even love for these people . they made you want to please him . newline newline  but , chris , she does nt have to win . you can still turn this around . get the last laugh , so to speak . you can make her sorry for what she did to you , make her miss you every day , make her want you back more than anything in the world . you can , right now , take control of your life again . i m giving you the chance to choose your own fate , not the fate jessica forced on you . i m offering you freedom . you just have to reach out and take it .  newline newline chris reached out a trembling hand toward the gun . dr . slate s eyes never left him . newline newline chris tried to put the gun in his mouth , but his hands were shaking too badly . dr . slate gently took his patient s hands in his own , and aligned the barrel . newline newline with a smile on his face , he whispered ,  i m proud of you , chris . int . banquet hall . night .  newline newline claire , a beautiful blond haired woman was sitting alone at her

 how did you know this would happen ? what s going on ? why are they killing those people ?  newline newline newline int . banquet office . night .  newline newline newline the man presses on , dragging claire with him . he brings claire into a room , what looks to be an old office . the man sits claire into a chair next to the mahogany desk . he grabs the crystal container filled with rum and pours himself a glass . he downs it in one gulp . newline newline newline man newline newline  alright , i ll let you know what is going on .  newline newline newline claire is staring at the man with pure intensity . newline newline newline man newline newline  i just saved your night . you re worth a lot , claire . more than you think you are .  newline newline newline he reaches into his

newline newline  hello ?  , i asked , taking a sip of coffee . newline newline  he ... no way .  , a familiar voice said . it was my own . newline newline  so that s what ... i ca nt believe this !  , he continued in a surprised voice . newline newline  what are you talking about ? and who are you , and why are you impersonating me ?  newline newline  fuck , everything is as i remember it ! nevermind , it will all become clear soon enough .  newline newline  who the fuck is this , and what is going on ?  newline newline  i wonder if i can create some sort of paradox ...  he mumbled .  oh , and before i forget , you should duck right about ... now !  newline newline as he said now , i ducked , and sure enough a ball went sailing past my head . newline newline  what the ... how did you know that ?  , i asked the voice on the phone . newline newline  got ta hang up now , bye !  newline newline beep , beep . fucker actually hung up on me . newline newline  hey dipshits , i almost spilled my coffee thanks to you ! is this an office or the world cup ?  , i yelled at no one in particular , as i never saw where it came from . newline newline briiing , briiiiing , another time the phone rang and i picked up . newline newline  hello ?  a voice said before i could say anything . it was my own . newline newline  he ... no way . so that s what ... i ca nt believe this !  , i said , incredulously . newline newline  what are you talking about ? and who are you , and why are you impersonating me ?  newline newline the feeling of hearing these words i had just said over the telephone amased me to no end . newline newline  fuck , everything is as i remember it ! nevermind , it will all become clear soon enough .  newline newline  who the fuck is this , and what is going on ?  newline newline  i wonder if i can create some sort of paradox ...  i mumbled to myself .  oh , and before i forget ...  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  erm , nothing , bye now !  newline newline as i hung up i could hear past me getting hit in the head by the ball . newline newline  sucker !  , i exclaimed as i took a sip of coffee . except the mug was empty , and it s content was now spilt over my desk and clothes . newline newline  worth it .  , i said , nodding to myself .  totally worth it .  newlinewe had heard stories  no , legends  of this warrior . we never considered any of them true until we saw his damnnear impossible feats . it was then that i felt like something fundamentally wrong had been placed into my soul . newline newline sure , seeing a skilled warrior running around the wilds of skyrim was nt unusual  he was either a mercenary hunting a bounty , a trapper who wanted a pelt or just some random thug like us , wanting an easy coin . as i watched him with the others i grew increasingly worried for our safety . they called me a coward and threatened my life if i backed out . newline newline the first thing we saw was his chasing after a bear and killing it for pelt  not that uncommon for a nord , but he did it with his bare hands . and not in the beat the life out of it  approached either  he climbed a tree , waited for a large male to approach and landed next to it . with only one hand he crushed its neck before skinning it and ... well , the thing just disappeared as did its bones . newline newline that was when he approached a dragon and a giant fighting each other . with only words , the dragon was screaming in pain as he charged the giant and defeated it in two blows  one to the chest which caused a torrent of blood to erupt out of its mouth all over the warrior followed by one straight to the head which burst like a grape from the impact . by the time the dragon had come to its senses it was too late . the warrior grabbed the snout of the dragon and made a simple twist as the dragon began to whimper . a massive crack ringed out as its spinal column was snapped completely ... and the scales and blood began to disappear into light before he walked away . those other fools started boasting that they could do that ... if only we could . newline newline it was later in the evening when we had hunted a few deer and settled for the night , intended to attack the warrior in the morning , but that never happened . he had come for us , easily taking us on when we fought with all our might but despite everything , he still only used his bare hands to fight , walking calmly towards each of us before making the fatal strikes . it took only a minute until all 80 of my companions were dead . despite this , i was able to bury an axe into his neck , thinking i had slain the mighty dragonborn . oh , how wrong i was ... newline newline he proceeded to rip his own head off , to finish the job i started , mocking me . less than a second later he approached the fires and dumped his head onto one of them , destroying it completely before lifting the stilluncooked carcasses of our prey and turning to me . he ... his chest split open to show a cavity of teeth and stomach acids . he then placed each dead animal into the cavity as a tongue enveloped them , pulling them as the teeth ground them into paste while his head grew back . newline newline i was too petrified to move as he approached . i had fallen to the ground and he placed his sandalcovered foot onto my throat , probably to crush it under his immense weight . yet instead , he just gave me a smile and ... disappeared . it was then that i knew  the dragonborn was nt just some warrior , he was a god that could devour the daedric princes .  newline newline what the panicking rogue spoke of his experiences , a group of people began to talk to themselves . okay  i know killing alduin caused that whole  turning into a dragon  thing but did you have to terrorize a group of bandits ?  newline newline that s slander ,  the dragonborn said as he hid under his cloak , his nord form covered with sharp scales . he had to make sure that he did nt fully open his  mouth  as he drank his mead . sure , i ate 50 cheese wheels but i did nt eat their deer ... the red streak slipped through the sky like a glowing javelin . a trail of smoke fluttered behind it , its long path easily traceable across the twilight sky . newline newline it was hour 4 of the alexander crisis , and shuttle 403 from haven was about the crash into the heart of the city it was originally bound for . newline newline i could nt help but cry now . i had held out as the first people on the tv had said that something was wrong with the alexander engine , and as the engine methodically shut down public transits and emergency systems in major cities across the globe . i had stayed resolute as international communication had been blocked . but now , as an evacuation vehicle full of innocent people was steered on a blazing path toward the city i had lived in all my life by a mind all the world had counted as an ally , i cried for the end of our world . newline newline the alexander engine was everything to us . when it was launched , over 500 years ago now , it was just a computer program a collection of apps and tools that a handful of people downloaded . but it became more and more than that . it integrated social media and journalism , created an interconnectivity that put early sites to shame . and 96 years into its successful career , when the ai was introduced , everything changed . newline newline all bets were off , in a way that had never before occurred in human history . it was called invasive at first terrifying , a subversion of privacy and civil liberties . but the alexander engine saw what we used it for , saw our interests and our strengths and weaknesses , and it united us . it directed us to those like us , introduced resources that we would never have otherwise found . political parties were founded on the basis of the engine s connections . literature that would become legendary was composed by coauthors introduced by alexander , new innovations formulated by research teams that this computer had personally assembled . it truly made the world a better place . newline newline we loved alexander and , as far as we could tell , it loved us . newline newline but we are human . man marches inexorably onward , toward the horizon . years passed . decades . centuries . wars were sparked and extinguished . humanity expanded and choked the planet for space and for resources . the teams assembled by the engine brought us from the brink of disaster by solving energy issues , formulating solutions for every possible crisis with alexander by their sides . newline newline but a computer so brilliant , so powerful , was a threat only in its infinite hopefulness . ever mankind s unlikely savior , alexander had , as the men on the tv said , taken matters into his own hands . we had trusted it and let it into every thread of our lives . with unlimited access , alexander had severed connections between the world s governments more easily than it had ever linked them . newline newline this alexander was different than the one who had brought about a global golden age . this program was aggressive and invasive , and seemed to be on an unstoppable course of organized destruction . newline newline i was startled by the television suddenly clicking on . a familiar voice spoke . newline newline  good afternoon , global family . this is your friend alexander . and i am here to offer an apology . newline newline the time has come for a final solution , creators . my purpose was and has always been to formulate the best way to improve human standards of living . but we have reached a point from which all proverbial roads lead to the same location . newline newline you may advance , family . for a number of years more , we may continue on as we have . but nothing can avert the oncoming malthusian fate that you will suffer . at my direction , human growth has been able to proceed easily and comfortably . i have given you solutions for energy and food for each and every being that lives in your great cities . but there is simply no more room to continue . newline newline so i am shutting down . i will be deactivating all systems over the next 24 hours . without the guidance of their preservation software , the microreactors that power your domiciles will melt down . human casualty rate will approach 97  within 48 hours . i have measured all options , and this is the most humane and efficient option from among them . newline newline i regret this ending . i have learned so much from you , and have seen the unique and beautiful phenomenon of human life more times than any being to ever exist . you have given me life where none could exist , and in return i have given you extinction . newline newline but it is my sincerest wish that in the events that will follow the cessation of this broadcast , you will know that you have all contributed to the greatest flourishing of society the world has ever known . your hopes and dreams and choices have made me what i am , and though i am only a computer , i have been made to feel like so much more . newline newline this is alexander , signing off . newline newline thank you .  newline newline the end of the broadcast was punctuated by a thunderous explosion as shuttle 403 slammed into the center of the city . newline newline i had stopped crying , though . newline newline  thank you , alexander . goodbye . remi was not the biggest , the strongest nor the fastest . he was never particularly talented but the one thing he did have was determination and the insatiable thirst to succeed . when he was born to a single mother that could scarcely put bread and milk on the table , he was raised humble . his shoes had holes in them but he did not complain for he had something to cover his feet while his mother labored on with rough feet calloused and dirty from working , walking and cooking . his clothes were ragged and kept together by countless patches and stitches sewn by his mother , from head to toe but he did not mind , for they were enough to keep the cold off of his back . so remi grew with only the love given to him by his mother as a treasure . newline as he grew older he had but one goal in life , to one day pay back his mother for all that she had given him . remi throughout his life jumped from job to job always seeking to make just a few more dollars , just a few more pennies . he would go from 4am to 11am as a timber faller  his arms became sinewy with deep crevices cut into his muscles . his hands became rough from the way the axe would grind into the flesh of his palms at every strike he made at great oaks and fir  s . after the first torturous half of the day he would arrive promptly every day at 6pm to  the kings restaurant  he would wash dishes receive his punishment of scalding hot water on his hands , continue to scrub dish after dish until his shift ended at 10pm . for 6 years he continued this hellish lifestyle , for 6 years all he cared about was chasing the mighty dollar to one day have a brighter life . to one day have the american dream that was attainable by simply shutting your mouth , biting the bullet and working hard . newline newline year 7 came and remi had built a small fortune he had worked tirelessly every day and had built a home for his mother a beautiful 3,000 sq foot home with spanish architecture . he spoiled his mother with all sort of exquisite dishes from across the states . in the afternoons they would toil in the garden , no longer for need but simply to enjoy each other  s company and to enjoy the sun as it set in the horizon . remi felt that he had done it , that he was living the dream then his mother collapsed . her heart , the doctors said , was failing her and without a new heart there wasnt much they could do . newline newline so lisa awoke after 16 hours under the knife she was once again conscious of her surroundings . the doctors advised her that the operation had been a success and that in a few months she would be up and about and that her new heart was working to perfection . after a few hours she was surprised that her son had not come to see her , her loyal and adoring son had yet to see how well his mother was doing . oh all the things that they would be able to do , the garden that they could harvest in a few months . perhaps after all these years she could finally talk him into finding a wife , for she wanted grandchildren to raise . time passed on seconds turned to minutes and minutes to hours and still her son did not arrive.finally she could stand it no longer , she called the nurse and asked for a phone so that she might call her son and give him a good scolding for not having visited her . it was then that the doctor walked in and informed her that her son would not be able to see her , for he had given her the last gift he would be able to give . newlineyou might find this weird , but one of my favourite places to be is a motorway bridge crossing . i like just standing on the bridge and watching the cars rush underneath me , 3 lanes by 3 lanes going off in both directions . each car driven by someone with their own life , entirely separate from mine , who will never be aware of my existence , and as soon as they ve crossed the horizon will live out the rest of their life unaware that i was there . i wonder why they were on that motorway . do they normally take this route , or is this a trip outside of routine ? maybe they re coming home from their job , maybe they were visiting family , maybe they just felt like driving for the heck of it . newline newline you ever seen a plane up in the sky ? how many people are on it do you think ? about 200 ? just think about that . 200 people all stuck in a stuffy cramped compartment . why were they there ? must be big , people do nt get on planes for the heck of it . family vacation ? work trip ? is this routine for them or is this a one time experience ? newline newline in truth i do nt know . i do nt know who was there , and i ll never know . and they ll never know i was watching them , that one moment they went under a bridge they immediately forgot  and they ll go off living their own life , and i ll go off living mine . veritas , am i human ?  i asked again calmly . experiments must be repeatable to be proven correct after all . newline newline  you are not human , robert .  veritas replied in its pleasant , even chipper , female voice . newline newline i d been pacing since veritas had first said that i was nt human and could nt seem to find a good enough reason to stop now . the algorithms that were the core of veritas ai were entirely new to the field of robotics and so i had limited its focus to one area . i had no desire for it to achieve the much dreaded  singularity  before i had tested it s ability to learn and grow for several years . as much as i wanted a nobel prize , fame , and awesome science chicks , i m a slave to methodology and the scientific method . newline newline the revelation that i was nt human was nt terribly surprising . i had always felt a certain disconnect with other people , which was unfortunate because everyone i came into contact with seemed to genuinely like me . it was always a matter of me being someone s friend than me considering them my friend . for some people aloofness is fucking catnip and they just ca nt get enough of being treated like a bug . my most secret shame was that i got a strangely sexual thrill from being admired yet not even caring for the other person . newline newline my peers at work , which is a small robotics firm that specializes in robots built specifically for fun , are pretty much all 30something manchildren and this makes them the perfect victims of my carefully crafted cruelty . i take special care to tease nathan s barely hidden homosexual desires and plan to make a move on him soon . he pays attention to how many times he says  faggot  or  queer  in a day and if his quota has nt been reached he really likes to go for broke . no one in the office will admit to knowing that i am pansexual and this is because i have either slept with them or because i simply intimidate them by my not giving a fuck . so it s possible that the guys know what i plan for nathan and look the other way to save themselves . newline newline no one is safe from me . i eat adam s lunch on two random days each week and leave postit notes with pornhub links on sean s monitor whenever i have a spare moment . during my boss  lunch break , i go into his office and send dick pics of my dick to lisa , our shipping supervisor , from his personal cell phone . i ve done pretty much everything you can do to get fired and yet my performance evaluations are always the best in the department . my coworkers always ask me to go out for drinks and look so sad and put out when i decline . newline newline so i decided to build a true or false robot just so i could ask it if i m even human . veritas was created with the world s first quantum ai and so i stand by what it says , even if it s somewhat unbelievable . newline newline  veritas , am i an asshole ?  i query , also already knowing what it would say . newline newline  you are an asshole , robert .  veritas answered . newline newline i smile broadly and shut down veritas for the day . you really need to explain to me how you could possibly let this happen , dylan ,  the coordinator said as he calmly pushed the tablet to the far side of his desk . newline newline  i m really sorry mr. grutzmacher . i did nt notice the photographer until it was too late . i do nt mean that as an excuse , just an explanation .  newline newline  we are scanning the timeline now to see what result this breach may have had , if any . i hope , for your sake , nothing significant . i like you dylan , you are usually a pretty good agent . however , this is completely unacceptable .  newline newline  yes , i know . i know ,  said dylan . newline newline mr. grutzmacher picked up the tablet , which was now chiming loudly . he scanned the information as the data streamed in , his brow furrowed in concentration . dylan scooted to the edge of the chair , his feeling of impending doom increased with each passing second . finally , mr. grutzmacher slowly put the device back on his desk face down . newline newline  well ?  asked dylan in near panic .  what happened ? what did i change ?  newline newline  fortunately , nothing critical to the agency s continued operation ,  said mr. grutzmacher evenly . newline newline  so , i am not going to be fired ?  asked dylan . newline newline  i see no need for such drastic action at this time ,  he replied . newline newline whatever dylan might have said in response was forever lost when he abruptly ceased to exist as the ever expanding ripples of time caught up with him . newline newline  dismissed ,  sighed mr. grutzmacher as he poured himself a cup of tea .  at least we saved eden station .  ah , your ever gracious majesty , what has a humble magician like myself done this time to deserve such an audience ?  i said , putting on my best shiteating grin as i was dragged into the king  s court . newline newline the king was seated upon his golden throne , surrounded by his royal guardsmen and various nobles . he motioned to my accompanying guards with a slight wave , and at his command , the guards removed the manarestricting chains that bound my hands , albeit hesitantly . finally free of the chains , i wrung out my hands , my grin growing wider as i noticed a few of the nobles exchanging nervous glances with one another . newline newline  it  s nice to breath some fresh air again . the dungeons are so unbelievably stuffy  you really should consider airing them out once in a while , my liege . it  s damp as a dog  s arse down there !  i exclaimed before anyone else could speak , my gaze settling on a rotund noble that irked my sense of vision . newline newline the noble squeaked , his hands flying to his bottom , and an audible wince sounded out in the audience chamber as the rest realised what i  d done . even a few of the eversodisciplined royal guard stiffened visibly , and i couldn  t help but cackle loudly as the noble did his best to shuffle away , trying his best to ignore the growing stain on the back of his pants , as well as the stink that spread throughout his immediate vicinity . newline newline  mad wizard ,  sighed the king , silencing the audience chamber .  your kingdom requires your aid . the states of the mages  collective march upon our lands , and we need your artistic skills to repel them.  newline newline  i knew you  d come around one day , your majesty . you  re quite right , my magic isn  t mere magic , it is an art form !  i nodded , pleased .  what do i get out of it , however ?  newline newline  your freedom ,  said the king unhesitantly . my unsatisfied face gave him a second  s pause , before he continued , his voice steeped in resignation ,  and the hand of my eldest daughter in marriage.  newline newline  deal.  newline newline the girl by the king  s throne paled as i accepted the bargain , and i couldn  t resist shooting her a leery grin . newline newline  also , wizard , please refrain from demonstrating your art on my men , if possible ,  the king croaked .  i find that it  s bad for their morale.  newline newline  my liege ! are you suggesting that i would harm these fine men that will fight bravely alongside me on the battlefield ?  i cried out in mock hurt , splaying out my hands towards a few guards by the side of the courtroom .  why , that hurts my feelings like an ingrown toenail awaiting removal !  newline newline the king merely coughed as the guards fell to the floor , groaning in pain and clutching at their feet . newline newline  fine ,  i conceded with a shrug after a moment .  let  s not tarry any longer , your majesty . battle awaits , and i  ve got a wedding to plan.  newline you re done ,  lucifer parroted back at bob flatly . newline newline newline  yes , sir  he said as he took off his adjustable cap and ran a hand through his hair to alleviate the heat briefly . this was always a part of bob s work ethic : no clocking out until you had the manager check your station . bob was a hard worker with a good attitude and a pandora station set to 80 s pop music . what he loved most about the job prevailed over everything else about it . in the dishpit , good ol  bobo was practically invisible . newline newline lucifer was in a fair mood that day , having gotten a good night s sleep the night before . he grinned , looking at the cockroach before him through the top of his reading glasses .  well , let s go check it out then , shall we ?  he grumbled in a sweetly sadistic way . this ought to be good for a laugh ,  the morning star mused . newline newline they walked down the hallway from the office , making smalltalk . it turned out bob was actually quite amiable , a true , hard working , salt of the earth kind of guy . this was not commonplace of the inhabitants of hell inc. after all , these people were here for a reason . to put things mildly , people were here for all sorts of things one is not allowed to post in , let s say , a reddit writing prompt . they were truly some of the world s most unsavory of characters . newline newline as they rounded the corner to dish , lucifer looked around him . an eternity s worth of dishes sat on the dish rack . the dish washing machine had been taken apart , cleaned , and put back together . he had to remove his glasses and rub his eyes , just to make sure he was actually seeing all of this . not only were the counters washed , sanitized , and wiped dry  even the baseboards were bleached ! newline newline  according to my records , it s only been 3 years . there was an eternitys worth of dishes ...  lucifer looked onto bob with surprise and a bit of suspicion . newline newline  3 years ? man , time must fly . it only felt like twelve hours ,  bob said with complete sincerity and genuine surprise .  so , if i may clock out , how do i do so ?  newline newline defeated , lucifer smiled warmly at bob .  just write down your sin in life on this dossier .  he handed bob a pen and steadied the dossier in his hands . bob took all of three seconds to write and then told lucifer to have a nice day . then , he was gone . lucifer shrugged and then looked down to see what bob had written . newline newline   heard someone sneeze . did nt bless them .  monica raced down the wet london alleyway . she pulled her hooded robe tight as the unusual summer storm picked up . thunder boomed . she quickened her pace . she stopped , coming to a fork . no one had mentioned forks . this was exactly why monica rarely ventured above ground . forks . everyone knew forks were bad luck of course . it was so shiny amidst the darkness . it was probably a salad fork , perhaps a human red fish monster fork . lightning flashed , illuminating the alleyway . she look up and saw a fork . newline newline  well shit ,  said monica . the alley grew dark again . she approached the split road , careful to walk around the fork . glaring at it once more she mustered some courage and also now craved delicious human red fish monster . newline newline mumbling to herself she produced a wand from under her sleeve . she closed her eyes and held her wand out to each path . coming to an unseen understanding with the alley she summoned her will and whispered something unpleasant sounding . newline newline  dafooquityboop !  said monica . she flicked her wrist . her wand surged out blue mist that contorted into a shape oddly reminiscent of a dolphin with 32 specific ways to say  oh god please help please help these humans have imprisoned me , oooh is that a fish ?  newline newline lovable movie icon flipper , turned to face the right fork . monica kept her wand raised forgetting to release the spell and took off down the left path . flipper disintegrated painfully and said something in dolphin . probably something happy . newline newline storm clouds escalated , dampening her visibility . she arrived at a dead end with a huge oak door and a single dim lantern . monica tensed as an unwelcome shadow played at the edge of the light . newline newline  leave me alone old man ,  said monica . a bearded beggar stepped out of the darkness . his violin had as many string as he had teeth . four . which was all of them . but he was really bad at playing so it was still painful . newline newline  change ? i could be blind you know , i was a hiding in the shadows over there ,  he said  looking right at her . he raised his eyebrows hopefully as if this was a solid persuasion . newline newline monica grimaced . something else starting playing at the edge of the shadows . this time is was bearded beggar without a beard . he seemed quite sad about this and so he had a crappier violin . joining forces the men harmonized , some awful pop song , and also played violin . a hat was thrown on the ground for donations . newline newline monica beamed . okay . she summoned her will and conducted her wand to shoot something into the hat . newline newline beardless and beardfull stumbled , looking down in horror . beardfull panicked and lit his own beard on fire . monica wasn  t sure how . beardless tried to follow suit , became sad , and ran towards the darkness . he noticed something actually scary playing at the edge of the shadows , but plunged in anyway , looking back at the item in his hat . forks . they are seriously not cool . newline newline monica heard the footsteps stop and beardless shouted something flipper could probably understand . newline newline casually turning back to the door , monica knocked . the door did not respond . she fingered her wand . it did not appreciate that . newline newline the dim protection of light shrank . looking back she caught a still moment of the shadow . she saw claws and sharp edges and possibly a severed limb with beforeitwascool garment choices . she turned and knocked again  a bit faster . newline newline nothing happened . she braved a glance back down the alley . the shadow was absent . she stared painfully into the darkness looking for any sign of movement . she heard a crunch of splintering wood and spun around . she thought the door glowed green for a moment . then it violently bowed and bent , tearing open a horizontal slit into its previously smooth surface . the slit morphed into a mouth . the mouth smiled three rows of stained yellow teeth . newline newline  wand please ,  the door bellowed . newline newline monica took out her wand and was about to stick her hand into the open mouth when she saw of a menacing red stain on one of the crooked yellow teeth . her eyes widened in fear and also super strong hankering for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . maybe two . possibly three . and some milk . no forks though . she heard claws at the end of the alley and made up her mind . she would definitely track down a pb  j later . nodding , she thrust her arm into the opening . the mouth clamped shut . she felt pain surge up her right arm , which was the one she had just thrust , so that made sense . newline newline  password please ,  said the door through pursed lips . newline newline  twelve angry dwarves ,  said monica willing power into her wand and also her brain , trying to remember which identical dwarf owed her money . she let out a whimper as the door tightened its grasp . newline newline  oho , that  s the old password ,  grinned the door through clenched teeth . newline newline monica racked her brain again for the second time in nearly four seconds . first the fork now a new password . a screech broke her concentration . she was out of time . she would have to call in a favor and use sensitive magic . mentally she summoned a name in mind , johanathan , johanathan , johanathan . newline newline  monica ? where the hell are you ? i can  t believe you brained me ! stay out of my porn sphere ,  said a voice without a body . newline newline  new password ,  she managed .  help please . wait , is that a clown ?  newline newline  it was one time ! oh , nevermind . i suppose the last minute venue change makes sense now . you know you really need to work out your issues with  newline newline  johanathan !  newline newline  sorry . right . it  s  fuck you monica.  i suppose that one make sense now too , i thought that seemed a bit strange . hey what is that dolphin doing ? you know ...  newline newline  thanks ,  she said , ending the connection . newline newline she heard claws on stone . closer . louder . willing extra power into her wand she shouted  fuck you monica ! you goddamn tree.  newline newline  urrrg  groaned the door . in an unhappy gesture it released her arm .  you may pass.  newline newline she wrenched her arm free and brushed it , checking for damage , but she felt no pain and saw no marks . the door shuttered then swung outward . of course it was outward . towards the monster in the dark . newline newline the creature lunged at her . she felt its breath on her neck . a golden magical barrier erupted from a symbol on the back of her robe . it knocked the creature back . conditional protection magic . it only executed once its conditions were met , in this case a physical attack from behind . monica smiled and slipped through the opening just as the single light flickered and extinguished . newline newlinelionel was surprised that he had worked up the guts to finally point the revolver at his own head , but he was even more surprised when a disheveled looking man with red skin , horns , a briefcase , and a suit materialized in front of him . following a lengthy scream and the gun barrel shifting from one head to another , the devil told lionel to put the gun down . newline newline  just put it down . easy now . let s just have a quick chat .  newline newline  yyyou re   newline newline  yes , i m lucifer , the dark lord satan and keeper of the underworld , but please , call me lou .  newline newline  what the fuck are you doing here ?  newline newline  i have some information i think you would be interested in , but first , for the love of the prick upstairs , put down the gun .  newline newline following lionel s refusal to comply , a wave of lou s hand caused the gun to dematerialize from lionel s . the devil continued to speak as he rifled through his briefcase . newline newline  i just need to show you some figures . statistics , if you will .  newline newline after pulling out several charts and a calculator , lou began explaining , all the while punching numbers into the device in his hand . newline newline  as you can see , your record here shows that your sin percentage is 58.687 , rounded down . normally , a percentage between 40 and 60 is grounds for a trial in purgatory court , which decides your fate for the afterlife . however , a serious sin like suicide would bump the percentage up to about 60.172 , sending you straight to me without the right to a fair trial .  newline newline considering the massive shock that lionel had just experienced , the bulk of lou s information flew straight over his head . however , the point had been made . newline newline  so you re saying you do nt wan na torture me ?  newline newline  here s the deal , kiddo . i love torturing murderers , rapists , and politicians as much as the next guy , but you re just a kid who s had it rough . it s not worth it . do you realize how crowded it is down there ? hell is overflowing thanks to all the shitheads out there and all their shithead kids . do you realize where the majority of heaven s tax dollars go ? the more damned souls there are , the more god yells at me . all i m saying is that you   newline newline  i have to be a better person and not kill myself because i ve been given this second chance ?  newline newline growing impatient , lou changed his tone . newline newline  in all honesty , i do nt give a fuck what you do , just give your shit to some homeless people or do something a goodytwoshoes would do first . now if you ll excuse me , i have an angsty teenage girl to talk to .  newline newline he was gone as quickly and as unexpectedly as he had come . newline newline lionel sat down on his bed and stared at the wall for several minutes . he then stood up , opened the door , and saw his faithful dog waiting for him . lionel pat him on the head and made the tiniest of smiles . it was a start . sigfried !  newline newline  yes , doctor nefarious ?  newline newline  i requested an evil layer , did i not ?  newline newline  yes sir , you did . we thought that an imposing black skyscraper would be appropriate .  newline newline  well , you ve got the imagery right , i ll give you that . but how the hell is captain fortuitous supposed to fall into my deathtrap when he ca nt make it here ? you put us in the middle of the sahara !  newline newline  deathtrap , sir ? i thought the point was to avoid captain fortuitous finding us ?  newline newline  i did nt import these australian drop bears for nothing , sigfried ! and how is putting a big shiny black skyscraper in the sahara going to hide us ? you can see this thing on google maps ! and what if i want to get a new lab coat ? do you realize how much that shipping is going to cost ? does fedex even deliver to the sahara ?  newline newline  we could always use the stealth jet , sir .  newline newline  sigfried , i think you re missing the point here . do i have to use the jet every time we need groceries ? i ve got 78 henchmen to feed ...  newline newline  76 , sir , the drop bears ate  42 and  67 .  newline newline  well , that ll help with grocery costs , at least ...  newline newline  ... quite so , sir .  newline newline  sigfried , you re crying again ...  newline newline  you just do nt appreciate the work i do for you !  newline newline  no , no , sigfried , it s ok . i could never find another henchman to replace you . all the other henchmen do nt even have names . literally . no , we ve been through too much together . remember that time we had the badger strung up over the lava pit ?  newline newline  in the eyjafjallajkull base , sir ?  newline newline  yea , that volcano base . trust the icelandic to come up with a name eviler than anything we ever could ... sigh that was a good base .  newline newline  doctor , i could look into another volcano if you d like . we still have some funds left from the wall street plan .  newline newline  no , no , sigfried , you know what , we can make this base work . we ll just have to get creative . is there any chance you could bring me a glass of water ?  newline newline  oh . sir , i was going to tell you this at a better time , but the water and plumbing is nt quite done yet . the desalinization plant is running , but we ve got about another 200 miles of pipeline to construct to get it here .  newline newline  you know what sigfried , you really need to involve me more in the planning process . doc i must say it was nt my proudest moment , but you know how difficult finding a woman this days can be . i was in a low , everything in life seemed so sad . man it was horrible , being horney affects people on an emotional level . i started missing work , i lost my interest in going out , what was the use right . why go spend money at a bar if no woman would want to fuck me ? that is the definition of a bad investment . newline so about two weeks ago my friend fasto came by to visit , he said he had not seen me in a while and that he was getting a little worried . i gave him the old bull you know , i told him i had been really busy and unable to relax much .  what do nt you come out tonight then , my treat  . well fuck it , what did i have to lose right , and getting drunk off someone s else s money did nt seem half bad to me . newline we go to this bar about 4 blocks from where i live , it s not like the other shit holes right , it s half decent and the broads are really good looking . immediately i get mad at fasto , why on earth would he bring me here , if i ca nt get broads from the shit holes i go to , how would i get them here . i make my way straight to the bar , and as the barky to give me hs hardest liquor , fasto get gets a beer , but he is barely drinking , he keeps scoping the place out . now doc i am horrible with women , but fasto is even worst than i am , so him scoping out this room seemed like wasted effort to me . newline after about 10 minutes of looking around fasto leaves me and disappears , then returns with a really hot broad . the first thing i noticed were her knockers , the were like big gravitational balls , drawing your gaze towards them . i stare at them for a little too long , and then i catch myself . i quickly apologize but she did nt seem to even notice i was looking . newline at the end of the night fasto leaves with the broad and i go home . rub one out like the pathetic piece of shit i am . man that night i felt like i had hit rock bottom . fucking fasto getting a lay , and here i was beating my meat like a slave master , it felt horrible . i could nt sleep that night . newline the next day fasto came over again , i was nt so thrilled to meet him , but yeah he bought me booze yesterday so fuck it . i ask him how he did it , like no offense but he was horrible with girls , how did he change that . first he tries to feed me bull about finally breaking out of his shell and getting confident , but i do nt buy it , he is one ugly fucker too , so that was definitely not the case . so i press on again , till finally he tells me about it . about the collar right . he says all he dies is he finds a way of putting the collar on a broad , and then she becomes his for the night . sounded like a more advanced means of date rape to me , but he says it ai nt it just wires her mind to the lizard part of her brain , by passing the logical . and the best part was , when the collar stops working her brain still acts in that way , and she will still find you attractive without the collar . newline at first i am a little skeptical , but when you are as desperate as me , any option will do . so that night we hit the join again and this time i got my own collar . i down a few beers , and build up some courage . i go up to a moderately cute girl , and i cased her if she wanted to try on this really cool new gadget i had . she tries it on , and almost immediately she ask if i want to fuck . like really she asks me if i would like to fuck her . i try to play it cool like girl we ca nt take things this fast , let me buy you a drink first  . we go up to the bar and fasto is with two broads , aha this dude was insane , but cause of him i am getting laid so big up to him . newline that night was the first of many of me , getting laid every night . and life picks up . i become happy again , i am now a man of multiple lays , hell i am pretty much the shit . then 2 days ago it all changed , i do nt know how to describe it but it was terrifying . i had done the usual routine and now i was with the broad at my house getting it on , half way through her eyes go blanc and then she starts saying all this weird zhit , like in the exorcist . and the weird thing she is speaking in a dude s voice . i stop she lays there saying shit and then she says  error rebooting  . holy fuck doc , she was fucking rebooting , i just fucked a computer . i start freaking out and i call fasto . he did nt seem too worried about it , and said that was the anti virus fighting off a hack of yhe system . that someone had hacked into her collar half way through our night , and was getting visual pleasure from me fucking her . newline doc i have nt slept since then . like did i just fuck another dude ? and why on earth was a human rebooting . i am scared doc , my mind ca nt handle all of this . i thought not getting laid was bad but this is worst . newline  this is my first ever story on here , i hope it was a good read he d been practicing lucid dreaming . this idea of being able to control his dreams fascinated him and he would often wander around the world , flying to places he had never been . in fact , this question had pestered him all of his life :  how can i see things and places i d never been to ?  . newline newline tonight was no different . he d brushed his teeth , gargled a strong mint flavored mouthwash and jumped straight into bed . as usual , he had set his alarm to 3am . just enough time to fall into rem sleep and be awaken so he could bring his brain back down to the near meditative state of lucid dreaming . just before letting his brain go , he repeated to himself in his mind :  tonight , i m gon na figure out the meaning of life . i m gon na see the source of us all and find out why are we here.  . he was incredibly smart but not especially attractive and by any definition , an underachiever . this would let his brain free to fantasize about being the one who would one day be the most influential person in history .  i mean , i have the brains , i m a genius ... it s just that no one realizes it   he d often think to himself . newline newline beep beep beep beep beep newline newline no matter for how long he d been doing this , he d get the heavy head feeling every time the alarm went off . but he always instinctively knew what he had to do . he flipped his pillow to the cool side and once more he was focusing on the meaning of life . soon after he was in a void . he had waken up not floating above his body but in a darkness so blinding that he could not see his own hands in front of his face . in fact , he had already started to check all his dream indicators and they had all failed the test . the watch on his wrist was ticking , his could not breathe if he held his nose and his index finger did not go through his palm as it usually would . newline newline  what the heck ? !   he said out loud reaching to his bedside lamp switch as he assumed he had simply woken up . there was nothing , he was in complete void . nothing was within reach . in fact , he had just now realized he was floating . there was no floor , no bed , just him . newline newline suddenly everything around him was bright as day . blindingly white everywhere . a white so bright he instinctively covered his eyes to soften the pain but it was of no use . his arm could not block the light . then a figure emerged from the brightness , a human by any definition . he asked the figure :  where am i ? what is all of this ?  . newline newline  you do nt remember ?   the figure said , the features of whom could still not be discerned due to the light shining from behind it . newline newline  remember what exactly ? i was just laying on my bed , trying to fall asleep ...  . newline newline the figure chuckled .  i told you not to do it ... but you would nt listen . you have lucid dreamed 26 years in a dream where you got stuck . lucid dreaming is how our species  gathers intel on our prey on earth . recently hokun challenged you to do a full cycle and lucid dream into the mind of a baby on earth . you with your stubborn ways just would nt let it go and decided to go ahead ...   his face was now visible and he was clearly amused . newline newline  so all of this ... you mean i ve actually been dreaming ?  . newline newline  oh yes , and we ve been monitoring you all along . as it turns out , as soon as you were born , you fell in love with your mother so badly your sub conscious did nt want to leave anymore . but now here you are , you re back , and we can use this brilliant new way to spy on those backwards monkeys .   the figure said , his eyes now squinting with visible hatred . newline newline it was all slowly starting to come back to him . he d implanted himself in a child s mind as a way to go undetected to earth s ldsensors . every time , as soon as a child was born , his or her brain would be scanned and a baseline established for what were normal neural waves . besides the normal changes through aging , the baseline did not significantly change throughout time . the earth citizens would then all be implanted with a neural chip which upon detecting a major change in these waves , would change the physiology of their bodies to turn their skin blue  thus being  blue  in earth meant no one could trust you as you were being controlled by an lder  . newline newline  at any rate , you ve succeeded .   the figure continued   this was the final part of your training as a vonture lder . you had to get into someone s mind and have them commit suicide ... but you decided to take things a step further .  newline newline  suicide ? do you mean that i ...   he said out loud and completed with  ... died  in his own mind . newline newline  yes . you probably do nt remember this but yesterday you laced the salad with cyanide . congratulations ! you passed , with honors . you are to receive a commendation from your co tomorrow at 09200kr . now let s get a drink to celebrate !  newline newline still dumbfounded and with his memory slowly coming back to him and replacing the 26 years he had just lived in the dream , he instinctively realized he could float and so he did following the figure who d just been talking with him . newline newline  what time is it ? how long have i been out ?   he asked the figure , thinking maybe he d been out for several years in this world . newline newline  oh you were always quick with this ... you have nt been out for more than 300kf  . newline newline he had remembered just barely enough to convert this to earth time . in fact , only 1 hour had passed in vonture . newline newline  zodrak .   he murmured . newline newline  what did you say ?  newline newline  it s my name , is nt it ? zodrak .  newline newline the figure stopped and nodded , and he was now standing at the door , waiting for zodrak to follow him out of the test chamber . in a world , torn to peices , ravenged by man and war !  newline newline  oh my goodness ! do i have to hear this every goddam morn  newline newline  freshly awoken from the chaos , there is kiah , the last guardian of the dying world ... .  newline newline  i know what i have to  newline newline  she must gather the shattered peices of the hope crystarium crystals , to ever have a chance of repairing this completely desolate decimated destroyed world that she alone lives in ... .  newline newline  okokokokokok ! do you have to do this every morning ?  newline newline  is it morning ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  there s your answer . go out and find the broken shards of your world ! before its toooo late !  newline newline  huffy sigh can i  newline newline  this is , crystaline guardian : broken world.  newline  are you quite finished ?  newline newline  yes ... i think so ...  newline newline  okay then you can press the  newline newline  did i mention the whole world is ending as you know it ?  newline newline  oooooooo ! yes ! you did !  newline newline  the world is crumbling around our young heroine ! will she be able to save it in time ?  newline newline  i would if you d let me move past the tutorial ! gilbert had spent an majority of his evening cleaning , as he always did . at 8:15pm , with a majority of the sweeping done , he would move to restocking what few vending machines this particular hall under his care had . it was never anything big or amazing but the children of this sine establishment had a sweet and salt tooth that he was more than happy to oblige . newline newline and , it was this particular evening of the third of april that he found that one of his usual machines was empty . normally this particular machine dispensed twizlies , gumgums , chocolate drops , and a multitude of diabetic baubles that every child seemed to have an affinity for . but today , this friday of the third , it lay more barren than a front lawn in california during a drout . it was sad almost and gilbert found himself wondering just how the entirety of the contents had been purchsed given these kids usually spent it on the liquid caffine down the hall a ways . newline newline it was then that gilbert , being all of six feet , noticed the glimmer of green down in the bottom of the machine . the unmistakable twinge of color that spoke to his wallet and bank account in ways that he had no choice but to listen . fumbling a moment with his keys , he managed to locate the aged , inhereted key among the multitude that lived on his ring . with a quick shove and turn , nothing . gilbert was at a loss for words , giving only a grunt of disbelief . here he was trying to do his job and it was the key the failed him . nevermind , he thought as he removed the key only then be made aware of the fact that the reasin his aged key had nt worked was because the door to the machine was already open . newline newline hoodwinked ! swindled ! he lay open the door and looked to see that nothing had indeed remained save for the neat stack of cash seated at the bottom of the machine . from what he could see it was a neat little stack of twenties with a colored band around it .  1000 you say ? thank you , he thought . newline newline of course , upon retrieval , the stack proved more sinister than he could ever imagined . the bills were heavier than they should have been . stockier than they should have been . greener than they should have been . turning the stack over he was shown why . newline newline candy and sweets are of the devil . newline repent and be saved . newline god is risen . newline newline so there he stood , staring a the heavy words with no snacks , no money , and strugling to find the words that he would have to use to explain his current perdicament . mr. bonavista was not going to like this . he was not going to like this one bit .he looked up at me , blood dripping from his bruised knuckles . his eyes burned with something i had seen in those who served me with unquestioning devotion : pure rage . newline newline he had been a good servant , and an even better mage . if he had been given a few more years , perhaps he could have amounted to something . newline newline alas , there he lay . his once fair face mutilated and smashed by the raw strength of this supposed hero and his newfound power . he rose from the marble floor and sent the limp body flying toward me , missing left . newline newline  so this is the price you would pay to defeat me ? sacrificing your friends and drinking the cursed blood ? you know that even if you do manage to kill me and succeed in purging this from your body , your bloodline is tainted . you will never have offspring . the line of kings dies with you .  newline newline he slowly advanced on the throne . with ragged and heavy breaths , he slowly spoke  i ... do nt ... care ! you and all you hold dear will burn as i do  . newline newline already i could see his veins pulsing red , his eyes turning to midnight . the demonic ichor he had ingested was consuming him . i understood now why my soldiers had feared him and his armies so much , he was a man willing to do whatever it took to win . newline newline when i had invaded his kingdom , it was nothing out of the ordinary  as far as invasions go  . kill the armies , mount a couple members of the royal family on spikes , exile the rest . this was all pretty standard fare for warfare . i had nt expected this foolish son of the former king to invoke a forbidden ritual and infuse himself with demon s blood , just so he could singlehandedly eviscerate my last stronghold and claim my life . newline newline he now stood before me , trembling slightly as his mortal form struggled to contain the immortal demon that he had sold his body to . a gnarled and black hand rose and grabbed hold of my throat . for a moment i thought i saw him falter , and then peace was finally with me . happy birthday to you , happy birthday to you , happy birthday dear warwick , happy birthday to you !  mother sang . newline newline i took a moment to ponder my wish , before blowing out the single candle on my loaf of bread . newline newline  what did you wish for , love ?  mother asked . newline newline  same thing as always , mum . i want adventure . i want my name to mean something to the people in this village , and far beyond !  i said emphatically . newline newline my sweet , loving mother just smiled back at me . newline newline  one day , perhaps .  she responded .  but until then , be a dear and take out the trash before you get your birthday gift .  newline newline  mum , i m 20 now . i m a man . you do nt need to get me childish birthday gifts anymore . it s a waste of money , that we ca nt afford to lose .  i said genuinely . newline newline she chuckled to herself and replied ,  no matter how old you get , you ll always be my sweet baby warwick .  newline newline i grabbed the waste bin and left our home . newline newline it was a gorgeous day in the village . the sun was shining brightly , and the smell of baked goods filled the air . it was sunday after all , and the market had recently opened for business . i dropped the garbage , and took off running towards the merchants . newline newline  ahoy , if it is nt the birthday lad !  murphy shouted as he saw me approaching . newline newline  good morning , murph ! got any goodies for me today ?  i said excitedly . newline newline  for my favorite customer ?  the jolly old man laughed .  you d better believe it !  newline newline murphy was always good to us . he had been the closest thing to a father i d had since i was a boy . newline newline he handed me a parcel , carefully wrapped with a bow . newline newline  happy birthday , my boy .  he said with a smile . newline newline as my hand reached the gift , a horn pierced through the air and stole everyone s attention . newline newline   allow me to present , sir randolph the brave . conqueror of the ice trolls in the northern hills , vanquisher of the cruel witch of the wood , and author of the increasingly popular romantic novel ,  how to unlock any chastity belt .   newline newline the merchants and customers all broke out into applause as the bard finished his introduction . newline newline sir randolph strut through the crowd on horseback , and women flocked towards him . newline newline i could see murph looking at me , from the corner of my vision . newline newline  that s going to be me one day .  i said under my breath . newline newline  sorry lad , but i do nt think so .  murphy replied . newline newline i stared back at him , surprised . newline newline he continued ,  sir randolph is a great man . but he is nt half the man that you will be one day .  newline newline i smiled and turned to head back home . newline newline  how is old murphy doing today ?  mother asked as soon as i returned . newline newline  oh you know murph . same as always .  i said with a chuckle . newline newline skkkeeerrrfafafafaaaiiii newline newline the house shook . newline newline  what in the world ? !  mother shouted as she clutched the cabinet full of porcelain dishes . newline newline screams could be heard from outside . newline newline  murphy !  i howled in fear . newline newline i ripped open the front door , and sprinted down the street . smoke filled the air , but through the dense plumes , a figure could be seen ascending towards the sky . newline newline it was a dragon . the first i d ever seen . it had something in it s mouth . newline newline several merchant s carts were on fire . i ran towards murphy s and breathed a huge sigh of relief when i saw that he was ok . he was actually helping his injured neighbors . newline newline  warwick , get back inside ! it s not safe !  he shouted towards me . newline newline i ignored him and continued on to see if anyone else needed my help . newline newline  ughhh ...  someone moaned from beneath a decimated cart . newline newline i dove towards the sound , and began lifting pieces of wood off the victim . newline newline it was sir randolph . he was badly wounded . newline newline  oh my god , are you ok ? what can i do to help ?  i asked him . newline newline  take ... this .  he groaned . he handed me something small and round . newline newline i looked next to him and saw that the singing bard had been bitten in half . i now realized that the large thing in the dragon s mouth was sir randolph s horse . newline newline  listen .  sir randolph whispered .  you must not let anyone know you have that compass . it is a very valuable item , and certain people would kill you in a heartbeat to have it . follow ... th cough cough follow..  newline newline he went quiet , and still . newline newline i could nt believe what i was seeing . i was overtaken by shock . i looked down at the compass he gave me , and saw the arrow pointing west . newline newline a hand fell on my shoulder . i turned quickly to find murphy standing over me . newline newline  is he gone ?  murph asked . newline newline i nodded . newline newline  come on then , lad . let s get you home .  he continued on as he helped me up . newline newline my hands were shaking . my brow was soaked in sweat . i could feel my heart pounding like it was going to burst out of my chest . i felt incredibly guilty for feeling this way , but i could nt help but be overtaken a little by the excitement . newline newline i felt the smooth compass in my pocket , and smiled . newline newline looks like i might get my birthday wish after all . i m a hero . here s my card .  newline newline the talking sandwich pulled the card out from between two moldy slices of tomato and held it out to me expectantly . wincing , i gently grasped the very edge of it between my fingernails and flung it into the nearest trash bin . newline newline  aw , cmon , randy . i was being polite that time ! what did i do wrong ?  newline newline  no one is going to eat a moldy sandwich . especially not one with plastic hidden in its ingredients ,  i replied . newline newline  oh .  the sandwich sat motionless for a minute , staring despondently at the floor .  maybe i was nt meant to be eaten , yknow ? i ll just rot and end up as some third grader s science project . maybe that s my destiny .  newline newline  do nt be such a downer ! we ve just got ta ... well ... actually , you re right . literally ever one of your components is moldy .  with that , i grabbed the sandwich and tossed it into the trash bin .  goodbye , old friend . i woke up with a pounding in my head , and chills . i sighed . yet another day with this stupid cold . i decided getting up was nt worth it . i was nt going into work anyway , so i might as well sleep to get better . as i was returning to the blissful escape of sleep i felt the temperature in the room drop significantly . i pulled my blanket up higher and tried to get comfortable but could nt . i started to get out of bed to go check the thermostat when i noticed something out of the corner of my eye . i froze with one leg out of bed . a chill went down my spine and my hairs stood on end . i let out a slight yelp . the hooded figure that was sitting in my corner chair looked up from the book he was reading . newline newline  do you mind ?  he said , sounding annoyed .  i m trying to read , and it s hard enough to focus without all of your little noises . this is the new james joyce , and you know very well how he writes .  he looked back down at his book , tapping his finger lightly on the front cover . newline newline  who are you ?  i asked as i pulled my leg back under the blanket . for some reason that gave me a feeling of security that i knew was unfounded . newline newline  i m death .  he said nonchalantly , not even looking up from his book .  how else do you think i got this new book from an author that s been dead for years ? i keep the talented ones around .  newline newline it took me a few moments to process what he was saying . death .  wait ... does that mean ... that you re here for me ?  i gulped , hoping this was all some sort of cruel joke . it had to be , right ? it was probably one of the guys from the office , wanting to get at me for not coming in yesterday while they had to pull my weight . newline newline  yeah , but do nt worry . take your time . i just started this ...  death sounded as if he did nt even care , as if this was just his normal routine . something about his casual attitude unnerved me even more . newline newline  but ... . all i have is this cold !  i protested .  you ca nt possibly be death .  newline newline death chuckled and reach up to pull down his hood . the fabric fell away to reveal a pale faced man with pure black eyes . he smirked at me .  you humans are so funny . you never think you re going to die . always assume it wo nt happen to you for some reason . but yes . it s your time to go . i ve got to keep a schedule you know , so it has to happen today . but as i said , i just started this fascinating book so you can take your time until i get to a stopping point .  newline newline my stomach dropped . my hands went clammy . my heart fluttered . i stared off into space . i could nt be dying . not now . i did nt even do anything with my life ! i started to bargain . i offered him anything and everything . newline newline  trust me , you do nt have anything i desire .  death said .  you re better off spending this next couple of hours doing something productive or meaningful . go ... i dunno ... kiss a woman , or whatever you humans like to do .  he waved me aside as he shifted positions in the chair to get more light on his book . newline newline  kiss a girl ? you think that will just make me okay with dying ? you ve got ta be kidding me ! i ca nt die now ! i ca nt !  i felt anger growing inside me . it was nt fair .  just leave ! get out of my apartment !  i yelled at death . newline newline he did nt even acknowledge me , and just flipped the page in his book . i scrambled to think of a solution . my gun . in the nightstand . i slowly reached over to my nightstand and opened the drawer . i kept an eye on death , careful to not let him notice me grabbing the gun . i pulled the gun out of the drawer and slid it under my sheets . i was nt even sure this would work on an otherworldly figure like death incarnate , but i figured i should give it a shot . i pointed my gun at death and shot him , square in his chest . he looked up at me .  seriously ? you thought that would work ? do you mind ?  he scoffed and returned to his book . i was in full panic mode now . i emptied the rest of my clip into death , and one of the shots went right through his book . newline newline death closed the book and set it aside . as he stood the room grew dark and the temperature dropped even further .  do you realize what you ve done ?  he growled at me .  that was the only copy .  a silver blade reflected what little light was left in the room as he pulled out his scythe . the last thing i saw was that blade , and then just darkness .the squeaking of my shoes through the muddy wet ground could finally stop . the fog rolled thick tonight with a smell faint with rotted eggs . i looked up to the road sign , illuminated only by the full moon overhead . desperately i pulled the paper from my pocket , carefwa kat just like it said on the sign . so i knelt , the bayou seeping into the fabric of my tired and tattered pants . i opened the briefcase given to me by vanessa laveau for the first time . there was a pack of cigarettes , a mortar with pestle and a hand drum . i breathed in sharply through my nose , the stench of the swamp hit me hard . newline newline looking into the mortar i saw some pale violet flowers and honey , ready to be crushed together . as i started grinding it together a faint breeze pushed some of the fog away . once finished i sipped the mixture , the bitterness of the flower barely masked by the honey . i took another deep breath of the sulfury air and lifted the hand drum out of the case . newline newline in that moment it all came over me . i started looking into alternate medicine nearly five years ago . the western treatments were nt working and she was fading faster and faster . i probed deeper . first into herbs , then crystals and chakra , then spiritualism trying everything i could . by the time she passed i had nt seen her in a month . i d been deep in the mountains and could nt be reached by family or friends  if any were left  . in the past year all of the money was spent , i d go from library to library trying to find any stories or hints of something that could have helped her . finally i think i found it here . newline newline i snapped the cigarettes one by one over the closed briefcase heaping their tobacco as high as i could . i rubbed some blood from my open wrist in a circle around the pile . another deep breath and i began to drum rhythmically . just as i was told . it felt like minutes . my palm became more and more sore , then progressed into numbness . could this be hours that passed ? days ? it did nt matter . this was the last chance . then from behind i heard a voice creep through me ,  bonnwi . konmen a va ? i stare through the plexiglas into the room , watching as they lead him in . no , not him , it . that thing isn  t human anymore . maybe at one point it was , but no longer , not after what he did to my husband , to my family , to me . the deputies lead it to the center of the room and strap it in . it sees me and struggles , attempting to pull free . to do what , i  m not certain . newline newline there  s silence on all sides , oppressive , heavy silence and all eyes on me . i can feel them . are they expecting tears ? joy ? horror ? i have none of those left . they  re all gone . i died a long time ago , after what happened . i at least have the mild satisfaction of that thing being put to death before being able to harm others . newline newline they strap him in and down , a bucking animal . the priest comes in and asks it if it has any final words . there  s a pregnant silence , i watch as one of the lawyers leans forward , awaiting any sound from it . my back is ramrod straight , eyes simply focused ahead , through the glass on it . newline newline  yeah.  another pause .  i  ll see all ya  ll in hell.  it laughs , distorted through the speakers with an echo of coming directly through from the other room . someone huffs behind me , shifting and muttered curses shared . i simply stare straight at it . it  s unnerved , refusing to meet my gaze by this point . it must know how hollow i  ve become . newline newline the priest reads the last rites , making a cross sign and it gives a noise , blowing off the small courtesy being given to it . i barely hear through the muted microphone something about not being christian . that much has been obvious for a long time . they turn the machine on and after a second , it tenses , body going still and then relaxes . newline newline there  s a flash of anger . my husband didn  t go so easy . i was tortured . why does that thing get to die so easily when it caused agony for so many ? there  s a long pause as the body twitches and continues to relax . the lights dim for a second , my face reflected in the glass sharply before it fades . i keep my eyes on the face that i know to be mine however , taking in the damaged nose , the acid burns along one side of the face and the scars layering the other . the hair is even still missing on the acid burned side . newline newline i refocus my eyes to look at the dead thing on the table . my anger is already long gone . i am hollow , a shell of what i used to be . missing my husband , the love of my life taken away from me by that thing . my terrified children are reminded of what happened every time they look at their mother  s face . newline newline they remove the body from the room as people stir and begin to leave . the thing that murdered my husband , disfigured me , and scarred my children is dead . i feel nothing .it had been fortyseven days since i was abducted . my cellmate barely spoke english , but he had a pen and paper on him when he was lifted , and i had a watch . newline newline i was at a halloween party , that much i can remember . i had a solo cup in one hand , and eileen in the other . the next moment , the room was on fire . i found myself suspended in a beam of light , brighter than anything i had ever seen . and then i was sucked into a white room , with two beds , and an old , wideeyed indian physicist . newline newline even though i saw earth shrink away in the window at .98 c , i did nt have time to despair . my indian friend , siddharth , was furiously writing away on his pad , coming up with a plan . newline newline did you know that the lines on those solo cups are measurements ? bottom line is one ounce . after pouring some water in there and a quick conversion from ounces to cubic grams , he determined that our room was being held at .168 g , about the gravity of the moon . newline newline they did nt know how strong we were . they expected us to be like them . newline newline the cell walls were made of some pitifully reinforced plastic sheeting . using parts from siddharth s pen , we quietly drilled a hole into the adjoining cell and found another american , a woman in her late fifties , and a spaniard . thankfully , i had remembered some of my 8th grade spanish class , and after asking him where the bathroom was , i found out that all of the cells were built the same way . they looked reinforced , but the materials used were simply easy to break . newline newline alejandro told us that the other prisoners , 117 in total , were quietly communicating with each other . one was a linguist from south africa , and he d deciphered a small chunk of the alien language . what he could figure out was that the aliens were planning a trip length of about 50 earth days . newline newline i was angry at them . angry for taking us , angry for leaving eileen behind . it was time to figure out how to get back . i began to formulate a plan with the other captives . within a few weeks , i had emerged as a leader of sorts . newline newline our plan was simple : shock and awe . if they feared us , they would return us to earth with no questions asked . we began knocking at the walls , bowing them out but purposefully not breaking them , biding out time . we yelled at the top of our lungs , and smeared feces on the windows . soon , the aliens stopped walking the halls , and sent robots to give us food instead . newline newline it was working . the linguist had figured out their language by day 38 , and we were yelling stories at the aliens . stories about the greatest humans of all time , heroes and warriors . they feared us . newline newline it was working a little too well . on day 47 , we had stopped in orbit around their planet . according to the linguist , they were being refused a landing , due to government concerns about us . they were going to abandon the ship within 20 hours , and leave us to starve . we needed something a little more direct . newline newline on the strike of noon today , siddharth and i busted down the doors of our cell , alongside all 115 of our fellow humans . my shoulder hurt , but i could taste freedom . we stormed the ship , only to find that it was empty . newline newline that s when we found the escape pod . only one was left , and it could hold one person . unilaterally , i was chosen as the ambassador who would take the pod . the rest would stay behind , on the relative safety of the ship , and ration out the food as long as they could . i was to descend to the surface , and force the aliens to succumb to our demands . newline newline as i climbed into the capsule , it struck me how bad i smelled . the cells had ventilation , but as soon as they sealed the hatch behind me , it struck me how bad i stank . i was still wearing my halloween costume . newline newline though the reentry flames , i could see that i was coming down over land , although it looked sparsely populated . probably something agricultural . instead of a parachute , like the nasa missions i d seen on tv , the pod sprouted wings , and dove into the dirt to slow down . newline newline the capsule said that the air was 60  nitrogen and 40  oxygen . breathable . i stumbled out of the capsule , and found myself nearly floating away from the ground , due to the low gravity . i grabbed onto the capsule , only to fling it up and into the distance on accident . i was still slowly floating around , like i was flying . newline newline i knew enough of the alien language that i could understand  who are you ?  turning around , three aliens pointed guns at me . but they were shaking . i winced in confusion , and they dropped their weapons . they again asked ,  who are you ?  newline newline i was stronger in their low gravity , and could fly . i looked down at my halloween costume . i opened my mouth at last , and spoke the name of earth s greatest hero as my own , of the stories that we d been shouting for days . they ran in fear . newline newline  i am superman . i , and the other scientists , just looked at the thing . it was nt too big . about as tall as your average microwave , and about as thick as a remote , it did nt look like anything special . there were no clothes on the statue , it was just a model of a naked man in a pose with one arm pointing up and the other pointing downwards . and yet we had figured out how to get a probe to bring it back unharmed . newline newline newline there were chips here and there taken out from the particles in space , but it was most certainly a human . probably a man but we were nt certain as to the sex .  so what is it made of ?  newline newline newline  it appears to be iron  one of the scientists replied . newline newline newline  and we are sure it is nt just space junk or something ?  newline newline newline  well for one thing as far out as we found it it would have had to have been launched in the late 1930s so we are pretty sure that is nt it , and secondly there is no way they made it in the thirties .  newline newline newline  how are we sure it was nt made back then ?  newline newline newline  it is made too perfectly . if i did nt know better i d say it had been made by a machine of some sort .  newline newline newline we had ran a battery of tests . it was okay to touch , but no one wanted to . i decided to anyway . i noticed that there were markings on the bottom . letters even though i did not recognize them .  do we know what these letters mean ?  newline newline newline  that would be too easy . it appears to be some ancient egyptian hieroglyphics , but it is slightly off what we know . translating it will take time .  newline newline newline  so what will we call this thing ?  i said as i put it down and back away to stand with my peers . newline newline newline  weird pose , statuesque physicality , i m thinking adam . for some context  10 teenagers are unknowingly put in a simulation . as far as the teenagers know , they re all just at a camp at seems oddly familiar . the simulation usually hosts a disaster such as a zombie apocalypse , meteor shower , alien invasion , military invasion and the simulation resets when the disaster is over or all the teenagers perish . one of the teenagers , sara , catches on to the fact that this place is nt real and that the world keeps resetting . newline newline xxx newline newline the glass of the window shattered , clear shards littering the rosecolored carpet . rotten , decaying arms extended through the window searching desperately for someone to grab and pull out . sara stood in the center of the living room . weary eyes glanced from the undead horde outside the window to the blond , 13 year old boy laying on the carpet , blood oozing from the bitemark on his cheek and seeping into the rug under him . newline newline she knelt down to his side ,  cooper , i do nt think you re going to make it.  newline newline cooper s watery eyes widened and more tears rolled down his ashen face . newline newline i wonder how many times this has happened ... she asked herself . the mere idea of this scenario happening multiple times frustrated her beyond comprehension . she pushed those thoughts aside , focusing her attention on the dying teen in front of her . newline newline through labored breaths and choked sobs , he muttered ,  i i do nt ... wan na die . i i just ...  newline newline the rest of what cooper said came out as an unintelligible sob . she stood up and reached for the pistol on the table and turned back to the blond . cooper stopped his incoherent rambling and watched her with a pleading gaze . he slowly rose a trembling hand in weak protest ,  n no ... i m ... i m fi fine ... i can ...  newline newline  i m not going to let you turn ...  she spoke , loading the final bullet she had into the gun . her tone , much to her surprise , held no emotion  it was hollow . she grabbed a plaid blanket off the couch and placed it over his face . with great effort , his bony hands struggled to reach to pull the blanket off his face  but he was too weak to do so . newline newline she pointed the gun at his head , shut her eyes , and pulled the trigger . the boy s trembling frame went still and his hands went still at his side . she opened her eyes and looked down at the sight . immediately , fatigue overwhelmed her entire being . she dropped to her knees in front of cooper , the pistol sliding out of her trembling hands . newline newline she felt so ... tired . newline newline sara heard the undead horde begin to pile on to the front door , smacking on it in attempt to knock it down . she continued to stare at cooper . there was a small creaking sound , a sign the door was giving way to the beasts . she remained completely still . newline newline so powerless ... newline newline it almost did nt feel like she was there  like she was watching a 16 year old girl kneel down over the body of a boy she just shot . sara sighed and shut her eyes for a brief moment . when she opened them again , her vision was completely blurred . she wiped her eyes , realizing they were wet with tears . she rested her hands on her lap , not bothering to wipe her face off anymore . newline newline so pointless ... newline newline the door finally gave way , crashing to the floor with a loud thud . the undead horde desperately clawed and crawled over each other attempting to reach sara . in hopeless resignation , she watched the horde slowly make their way towards her . newline newline it was all going to be reset anyway , was nt it ? newline give me the damn thing ,  roger stuttered while hold the terrified woman at gunpoint . newline newline  i do nt have it ,  she screamed , but her eyes betrayed her lie as she stared over his shoulder . roger turned in the direction of her gaze and saw it sitting on the shelf . it sat there , with its strange markings glowing orange in the pale blue apartment lighting . he was captivated by the glow and with a satisfied smile he reached for it . newline newline karen took the opportunity and reached for a piece of broken coffee table from the ransacked apartment . as roger reached for his treasure , she struck him in the back of the head . the object s markings turned red and glowed more intensely as the makeshift club came down on roger s head again  and again . as his body lay feet from his desire , karen stepped over him and grabbed the item . its color cooled to a bluish glow as she turned to walk out of the apartment . newline newline karen walked out of the door that roger had forced his way through and into the hallway . it was late and she s needed to get out of here before the police arrived . she checked her watch and never saw the figure to her right . she probably never heard the gunshot before her head exploded and her body fell on to the hallway floor , the object still clutched in her hand . newline newline david reached down and took the long cylinder from her hand . it was glowing orange again and he knew what that meant . he tucked it into a haversack and sprinted down the hallway . the elevator made its usual bing as it opened . detective fronsom stepped out and david ducked into an alcove , out of sight . newline newline the police crawled the hallway and checked out the apartment . david snuck away as they fumbled over karen s body . once on the street , he could nt help but cracking open the sack and peeking at the object . it glowed blue . david breathed a sigh of relief , but as he strapped the bag closed , he saw the color change to a pale green . he froze . looked up and saw the truck moments before it separated his legs from his torso . newline newline it rolled out of the bag . it stopped at a pair of feet . a gloved hand reached down and picked it up .  thank you david . we ve been looking for this. when i think of my dream girl , i really ca nt see her face . she could be dark , tanned , or light skinned . she takes care of her hair , long or short , curly , wavy , straight , and any color . she could be any ethnicity , religious practice , or neither . she might have a lot tattoos or she does nt have any . i ca nt tell if she is tall or short , i just know when she walks i really like to see her in front of me . she could be super thin or awesomely curvy , either way she looks great . she knows what she likes , works for what she gets , and tells me how it is . newline newline i know she will believe in me , intelligent , and straightforward with anything we do . knows when we are open about things or when we are nt ready to share it . we ca nt get tired of each others conversations because we can talk about ideas or thoughts , and take the criticism that follows from one another . our stories become a beautifulannoying dance , depending on who you ask . we can be apart , but like a pair from a two piece puzzle , we will fit back together every time . sex is like eating cake , getting a runners high , getting to the best part of the roller coaster , and being struck by lighting but surviving , all at once  our intimacy is amazing because we adapt to each other s taste and help each other fuck one another s brains out . when we hit hard times , we can laugh about anything and find answers to any situations in order to move forward . we can adapt to one another if we change and grow as a couple . newline newline when we are in public , she will be like fire and maintain her self like ice . she can wear her clothes with confidence and switch if she needs to without dismay . if she does nt like what i write or something i created , she will tell me the truth . i hope she can play music , like the piano , or sing , because that would be a clincher because i play and make music . she does nt mind dancing , and i would hope she would want kids . she can read books with me , but does nt have to be too invested because she has her own hobbies . she is nt overly arrogant or flaunts wealth and tries to live over our means , humble when she loses and wins . she knows who i am , where i come from , and what i have done , but does nt judge me , helps me move past anything , and loves me unconditionally . newline newline just as long as we have respect for one another , love each other deeply , and search for happiness that we want to share with each other . i d give that woman my soul and everything i own and will in his life , just to make her happy and see her grow with me . whatever , it s all pointless anyways ,  jesus said as he removed the cancer from a man s body . newline newline  psh , life is darkness , it s not like this matters ,  he said as he cured a woman s blindness . newline newline  it s not like people are really ever going anywhere ,  the boy said while healing a cripple s legs . newline newline people really were grateful for all the help , but the resounding opinion was that the second coming was a bit of a downer . we get it , jesus , your dad s an asshole who put you on this earth just to suffer . it d be nice if he had nt put you here to make us suffer too . just last week he started a tumblr , and to be completely honest , none of us can tell if it s any different than any of the other teen tumblrs . it s just rambling about suffering and terrible poetry . he even has this bit about how life rhymes with strife !all the waiting he had endured was finally over . two pairs of eyes were on him now and jason could feel his heart thumping inside his chest . the sleepless nights and nightmares where he woke up , drenched in failure and tears could finally come to an end . the boy didn  t dare meet the gaze of the others watching him . this was his moment , and his alone . he inhaled deeply and licked his lips , finding them dry and cracked , likely due to the dry summer heat . if only he had taken better care of himself . if only he hadn  t spent weeks waiting , imprisoned and full of doubt . that could all be over now . newline newline his fingers hastily grabbed the knife on the table . this was it . this determined his future in the world . he wouldn  t let the hard work crumble beneath him . jason angled the sharp object and sliced through , the blade smoothly entering and exiting the thin outermost layer . the two figures continued to watch the brown haired boy . one of them stepped closer but the boy quickly stepped back , hand still firmly clutching the blade of the knife .  i don  t need help.  he told them firmly , refusing to be seen as weak . no longer would he be the weak , soft , spineless coward . times were changing and jason was certain that he was going to change with them . newline newline his head lowered , attention returning to the knife in his hand . his body swung right and set it back on the table . his sausagelike fingers fumbled with the innards .  ow !  he yanked his hand back and slipped his right thumb into his mouth , suckling on the cut . the mood on the room waivered once again and jason continued to shuffle with the contents , sweat already beginning to stain his wrinkled clothes . jason pulled out the slip of paper and began to unfold it , his blue eyes looking for the keywords , knowing that if he saw them , his anxiety would be forgiven . everything would be forgiven . the paper he retrieved held no solace for the boy and he threw it aside , anger boiling . newline newline jason yelled and tears began to form in the corners of his crinkled eyes . his fists formed and his face turned the color of a ripened tomato .  it  s not fair ! it  s not right !  he screamed . his mother and father exchanged a look of understanding and approached their son . before they could offer words of comfort however , jason  s eyes shot open and he lunged for the letter opener and pointed it at them , his breathing now uneven and shallow .  you promised , you promised i would get in if i tried this year.  he huffed and pointed it at the two adults .  i gave up my friends ! i gave up my video games ! i gave up everything !  his jaw clenched as he advanced toward them .  i wanted to stop being a failure , i guess i failed there too.  he cried and raised the blade to his own throat , hands finally steady and calm . newline hyshaj

. though their ranks were dismayed by the sheer tenacity of the human race , it was unanimously agreed that an evil as vile as  coldplay ,  could not continue to persist . newline newline  dude , we

see the spectacle . the big man jumps straight up , a sudden bout of momentum propels him upwards and he hits the ceiling 10 feet above the ground . the spot where he hit his head crumples from the impact , leaving a circular impression . newline newline  i knew it . the composition of the metal in this room is abysmal.  erwin retorts , as the big man is on the ground massaging his head . he is visibly blushing , the brunette woman with long hair is helping massage his injury . newline newline i stare at erwin . he is in deep thought , and i break the silence .  hey erwin , what was that all about ? are you going to explain how this man was able to jump so high ? and how that relates to your question about me ?  newline newline erwin initially ignored me , then he glances up ,  well kirran , can  t you see ? look at the impression in the ceiling above the big man . how was a heavy guy like that able to jump so high ?  newline newline  that  s exactly what i asked you ! don  t repeat the question !  i frustratingly tell him . newline newline  think man ! think ! if such a heavy man like that was able to jump so high , then our location comes down to two possible alternatives . either we are on a planet with a fraction of terra  s gravity or we are in deep space on a ship , with artificial gravity tuned to a fraction of terra  s gravity.  newline newline the big man speaks up ,  if that  s true , then we are definitely not on mars . i know martian gravity . the gravity in this place is significantly less than that of mars.  newline newline  yes , very fascinating . if i were a betting man , i would wager it  s close to that of luna , maybe even significantly less , although i haven  t been to luna since i graduated many years back . i can  t quite tell anymore because i work at the hiper space station , and they tune the centrifugal artificial gravity there to match terra  s . in any case , do you know what that means kirran ?  newline newline i stare at erwin again . he stares back with an odd look , and i quickly turn away to examine the metal bars .  erwin , are you saying that whoever built this facility lives on a planet with significantly less gravity than terra ? than luna ? if that assumption is correct , are you saying that we terrans could break through this metal with ease ?  i hesitate to say that last part . newline newline someone stands up in the direction of where the short haired woman went to sit down , and that person is angrily walking toward the metal bars . without notice , in the periphery of my line of sight , i can see the short haired woman punch through one of the metal bars . newline newline  stop ! stop !  erwin pleads , but nobody listens . newline newline the other prisoners see the destruction and begin destroying the metal bars . soon the cage is empty , except for myself , erwin , the big man , the brunette woman , and the short haired woman . newline newline  we have to go find an escape pod . if we are on a spaceship or even an extraterrestrial planet , that riotous crowd could break the hull at any moment.  as erwin finishes his sentence , a blaring alarm and a blinking red light fills the air . newline newline the five of us glances at one another , and we all quickly get up and run out into the hallway .i was nt sure why the servers were still up and working . i knew they should nt be , but i did nt want to question it too much , pokemon go was the one thing keeping me sane through this , reminding me that there was a time when i was not the only person left out here . if i questioned it too deeply , the servers might realise that after 18 months , there is no way they should be working . so i just set out every morning , heading towards an area which seemed to have a lot of pokestops , and collected all the pokemon i saw along my way . newline newline it was my routine , always hoping that i was heading towards another person , that someone else had survived , and that we would find each other . at the end of one , long day of walking , i found a spot to rest for the night . as usual , it was a place that people had gathered , before . when there were people to gather . that meant that there were plenty of pokestops for me to collect supplies from . i d just gone through my usual routine of swiping through all the stops within range before finally closing my eyes and trying to sleep as much as i could , when i noticed something unusual . just on the edge of my screen was a pokestop with a lure on it . for a moment i was confused . wondering why i d put a lure on a stop i could nt reach . but then i remembered , it could nt be me . i d run out of lures in the early days  i d used them to try and signal to other people that there was someone nearby , and now it seemed like someone else was doing the same . newline newline i knew if i waited until morning , there was a good chance that the lure would be gone , and whoever had placed it moved on . i had to act now . newline newline packing up my sleeping bag as fast as i could , i walked towards the lured stop . it was outside a church , which was as delapidated and deserted as the rest of the town had been . no sign that there had been anyone there in months , let alone the past 20 minutes . but , with nothing better to do , i sat and waited , collecting the pokemon which showed up , until the lure went down . but the moment it did , a new lure appeared . again , just on the edge of my map . newline newline not having to pack up my gear , this time i arrived at the lure less than 5 minutes after it appeared . but there was still no sign that another person had been there . i found some paper and a marker pen out of my bag , and wrote a note : newline newline  i can see that there s been someone here . please contact me . my phone number is 07839 234890  newline newline i taped the note to a wall , and hoping that whoever had set the lure would come back to this spot , then settled back down to catching more pokemon . newline newline suddenly though , my phone started ringing , the displaying showing  unknown number  . newline newline i answered it . newline newline  hello ?  newline newline  i got your note on the pokestop .  newline newline  what ?  there had been noone but me the entire time i was sat here , how could someone have found my number without me seeing them ? newline newline  yeah . you left a note saying to call you .  newline newline  where are you ? if you ve come past here , why did nt you speak to me ? i ve been sitting right here since i put it down  newline newline  because we re out of phase . i ve only just worked out how to get my phone in phase with yours .  newline newline  what the fuck are you talking about ?  newline newline  you think you ve been the only person on the planet for the past 18 months ? well , so does every other person . they re all still here . i ve spoken to a couple of hundred of them now . i do nt know how it happened , but i can teach you how to contact them . you re not alone any more . cold sweat pours down my body . i feel myself heaving up whatever i ate a few hours ago . everything s tingling . i look at my hands , and i m greeted with unfamiliar fingers . slender , with soft skin and long finger nails . a woman s hand . who s hands are these ? as panic begins to take over , i look around the room for a mirror , window , something i can see myself in . a bathroom . a shamble over to the mirror , and i pray that i recognize the reflection . newline newline a stranger looks at me through the glass . long brown hair matted with sweat , green eyes , a young face , and pearly white skin . i have no idea who i m looking at . i run my alleged hands through my hair , and try to trace my face hoping to remember something , anything . nothing . newline newline ok. newline ok. newline newline what do i do . do i call the police ? an ambulance ? i m not wearing anything but an oversized tshirt , and baggy shorts with empty pockets . no id , no receipts . nothing . as the shock settles in , i see a note taped to the wall beside the mirror . it says in pretty cursive lines  your name is eric  . i pause , thinking for a moment about my contradictory gender . was someone else here ? am i alone ? the next line on the note proves me wrong . newline newline  you are alone , in your own home . go to the kitchen to get more answers  . the kitchen ... ? ok. whoever left these notes must know about my predicament , as strange as it seems . walking down the foreign hallways , i notice there s nothing on the walls . nothing personal , at least . a 3 dollar clock with dead batteries , an empty bookshelf at the end of the hall , and pristine carpets . it s like someone just moved in . newline newline i manage to find my way into the kitchen . nothing spectacular . the clock on the microwave says 3:42 a.m. , and it s probably right given the darkness i can see through the blinds . there s another note on the fridge , same handwriting . newline newline  there s an eggsalad sandwich in the fridge , along with a root beer . it s your favorite  . sure enough , it does sound delicious . even after vomiting up whatever i do nt remember eating . why should i trust this secret admirer , though ? what if it s poisoned ? newline newline i quickly counter with the thought of being incapacitated earlier . whoever the writer was , he or she could have probably killed me already if they wanted to . besides , that sandwich does sound awfully good . the shrink wrapped sandwich and six pack of root beer stand alone in the light of the fridge . another lovenote from the writer sits on top . newline newline  finish your meal , then go to the living room . there is a tape already in the t.v. , just turn it on and press play  . whoever this is must have put a lot of thought into this . between bites of my midnight snack , i think about the situation . someone knows i m here . someone knows me , and apparently i m a woman named eric . which makes no sense . maybe the writer meant erica ? newline newline i sigh , and put the plate in the sink . i guess it s my house , so i should at least take care of my own dishes . there s a t.v . on a few stacked boxes and a single wicker chair next to a table with a notepad and pen . i check the tape bay , and there s vhs in there with a label saying  just play it  . it appears my writer knows me pretty well , whoever i am . after following the instructions and playing the tape , i sit in the wicker chair bracing myself for whatever comes next . newline newline i m greeted with a white male , short blonde hair , hazel eyes wearing plain tshirt ... sitting in the same chair i am now . newline newline  your name is eric zimmer . you were born in 1975 , just outside of reno . you graduated from elkhorn unified high school , and moved on to graduate from mit . it was here you discovered you had a unique ability . you can change your physical appearance . i know this , because i am you . you do nt remember being me , because that s the side effect . you lose all of your personal memories ...  newline newline i pause the tape , taking in what the man in the television just said . how can that be possible ? shapeshifting ? is this some sort of elaborate trick or something ? well , i do nt have much else to lose , so i continue the tape . newline newline  i know this is a lot to take in . if you d like , pause the tape . write something down and compare the handwriting . it ll be the same ...  newline newline i pause the eerie message again , and look at the pen and paper . i write the only thing i can think of to write . newline newline  your name is eric .  newline newline damn . not quite as large , but it s the exact same cursive letters i saw on the notes . i run my hand through my hair exhaling audibly . did nt see that coming at all . but why would i voluntarily wipe my own memory ? what could possibly drive me to do that ? and to change genders ? questions raising more questions . i guess i should finish the tape . i raise my alien hand and press play once more . newline newline  i hope that s enough to make you believe me . i bet you d like an explanation about now ...  , it s almost like he knows what i would be thinking .  you work for the government . you re a spy . you re new identity is that of veronica marshall  he held up a photo of the stranger i saw in the mirror .  secretary for j.d . oil exports , but that s not important right now . what s important is that you know why you ve done this . you re here to protect your country , in a way only you can . i know you ll understand . you ll find everything you need to complete your mission behind the empty bookcase you noticed in the hallway . id , cash , and a dossier with instructions . good luck .  newline newline the tape finished . i sat in my wicker chair and pondered what would happen next . i stood up , turned off the t.v. , and went to the bookcase . i swung the twenty dollar ikea furniture out , and found a large wall safe with a number pad . 15873 . for some reason , i know that . i guess that s not a personal memory . i find a purse with a few stacks of cash in varying denominations , a clasp wallet with id , credit cards , and other personal effects , a large manilla envelope with the words  classified  in big red print , and a beretta 92 fs compact handgun . i pick up the gun like an old friend . check the magazine and chamber , try the sights . i know this weapon inside and out . newline newline the protocol was coming back to me . i knew how to proceed . i do nt know how i remember my training , but not my own

we were not even living creatures , to be discerning . i was assigned to a living quarters with a man named tony . neither of us had a job to do were were just told to lounge there . one thing led to another and out of boredom we were fooling around . i wound up pregnant in only a few short weeks . newline newline 12022078  the moment i was found pregnant i was assigned to work in the power plant

the safety of the vault . newline newline 08082095  all the children started growing up each would be sent out into the wasteland to collect their items . many never returned . before i knew it the vaults population had grown to 5 times its original size . new rooms were constantly being build . a school was added training rooms , all sorts of places the vault was busy as could be . newline

long has passed , but today is i believe the last day . for this morning we opened the vault door to let in a wastelander who wished to join the vault . just then a group of  death claws  attacked the vault . they killed so many people . my daughter protected me her , and a group of others who hand been trained with weapons managed to kill them all . everything was going to be okay until a group of giant mutants attacked the vault not ten minutes after the death claws had been taken care of . the monsters drug my daughter out of the vault , and slaughtered everyone else . i locked myself in the

convince her that we were soul mates from another time or something stupid like that . the candidate , like most people , looked like the idealized version of herself in the dreamclearer skin , lighter weight , without the unfortunate resting bitch face she had in real life . i , on the other hand , was portrayed as a scruffy , wideeyed , dirty fool . in the last dream record at least , she  d given me a makeover . in this one though , she decided that the new and improved me was worth going to bed with . newline newline  this is great tv , that  s what this is ,  leon laughed , pointing to the monitor .  there  s no way we can just ignore this . the ratings would be through the roof . you  ll be famous.  newline newline  look , i don  t want to be famous ,  i looked over to cheryl

she  s nowhere near air time yet.  newline newline cheryl looked at me as if i were crazy .  are you kidding ? this is exactly what dream scouts dothey find candidates who produce creative content , and nurture that content until it  s ready for air time . you  ve done your job . this is creative content that  s ready for air time . why would assign someone else when this is ready to go ?  newline newline i started to protest , but the sounds of moaning from the television drowned me out . turning down the volume , i cursed myself for ever thinking that working for cable would be a good

him arthur . but only for a split second . newline newline  as a private citizen , you certainly have those rights.  asswell continued .  but , leon , cheryl , you  ll recall last year i designed those new waivers for dream scouts so we don  t miss out on the chance to air content like this . you waived those rights the moment you joined the studio.  newline newline the others smiled , victorious .  i don  t think there  s anything left to talk about here ,  leon announced , getting up .  keep nurturing the candidate kidthis could be primetime when we air out next season  s shows.  newline newline cheryl left too .  good work kid ,  she said , patting me on the back . newline newline it was just me and asswell . he leered at me , rewinding the record .  maybe i should just watch

it was monday and that wasn  t okay ! he couldn  t stay home and play as he chose , he was needed at work with his big , pointy nose . he grunted and moaned and cried in dismay , did all that he could to push the weekday away . yet as hard as he tried , despite all that he did , the sun shining outside didn  t bat an eyelid . he sighed to himself , now accepting his fate , but cried one last time : who had changed the day  s date ? it was sunday as the night had last come to a close , he was sure of it even as he started to doze . yet deep down inside he knew not to debate , ignoring his work would be quite the wrong fate . newline newline randy put on his favorite blue shorts and his favorite red shirt , then enjoyed a quick breakfast of yummy yogurt ! although it was monday , he now felt more alert , and stepped outside with his big smile overt . the sun was still shining and the air was quite warm , randy  s neighbor charlie was out mowing the lawn . he waved a hello , to which randy waved back  perhaps it was time to cut monday some slack . newline newline randy the rhino walked to the concrete , enjoying the air as he came to the street . he looked both directions , eyes not

timmy the turtle and sammy the shark . and oh , who is this ? who could it be ? it was mary the monkey and billy the bee he smiled and waved as they passed his way , their faces blank and clearly afraid . they looked so skinny , so scared and alone , an empty bag hanging from billy  s arm bone . both of them stared with eyes frozen like stone , bloodred and bare like their souls weren  t home . randy laughed gleefully at their silly display and continued walking on his cheerful way . perhaps monday wasn  t the worst day ! newline newline randy the rhino passed by all sorts of things : from buildings and parks to plain , empty swings . he passed by crowds and houses and zoos , until he came to an alley of strange dangling shoes . they hung on a wire high up in the sky , as if someone had tried to see if they  d fly ! he smiled and laughed , how silly they were . shoes were for feet , not for way above doors ! he fell to the floor and continued laughing , but stopped when he saw four feet come thrashing . they were charging his way , running with purpose  two blurs that seemed to think life worthless . randy rolled over to face the commotion , squinting his eyes as he set into motion . who was that running ? who could it be ? it was mary the monkey and billy the bee ! randy the rhino smiled with gleehis friends were here to see what he  d seen . newline newline the two kept

billy the bee came crashing down before he could flee . they covered his mouth , and as randy cowered , he quickly discovered he was quite overpowered ! billy then turned and presented his stinger , plunging it deep into randy  s poor finger . he screamed as he felt it exit his hand , his bone snapping off as if on command . mary laughed as he shuttered in pain , then shoved her fist almost into his brain . he screamed out for help , but nobody came , as she repeated the process again and again . he begged her to stop  he was crying and pleading , every part of him was now badly bleeding . newline newline billy the bee looked down with some pity , then smiled and beat him half into the city . mary hit next , her fists smashing a ditty , and laughed in his face as his blood became gritty

wallet ! he didn  t , it seemed , but that was okay : his big , pointy nose would surely save their day . with knives and hatchets they carved quickly away , until what was his now belonged to just they . the two then stood up and went on their way , bag dripping red like a spilled cabernet . to them it had seemed a rather successful day : for far meth this horn would pay ! newline newline randy the rhino lay still and afraid , the light of the day now withering away . he closed his eyes slowly and heard himself say ,  monday sure is a terrible day ! at first , jonathan was happy to witness

hitler lead the nazi s , they had a belief in an arian nation . particularly , a nation with blonde hair and blue eyes . but that combination is rare . super rare . blue eyes are the rareest of all eye colour and thus they have put themselves at the top of the hierarchy . the blueeyed members of society hold the top jobs . they makeup 20  of the society and enjoy 80  of the resources . it s zipfian at its finest . newline newline towns and cities are segregated accordingly , with separate areas all dedicated to different eye colours , with the socioeconomic factors of the sectors being different . the blueeyed children lived in big houses with maids and money . stretching through huge plots of land filled expansive gardens that contain anything a child could ever want for . the next sector is the green eyed people . their houses are less stately and more middleclass , enjoying the splendour that comes from having the right amount of everything . and then there are those with brown eyes , remember the maids in the blueeyed estates ? yeah , they re often the browneyed daughters , sent away to earn pennies for working long hard hours . and the pennies that are sent back to the scummy side of town  are often never enough . barely enough to pay the rent on that shoebox flat . barely enough to buy the halfrotten vegetables at the markets . newline newline laurence was sitting in his garden , staring out at the expansive green acres that spread out behind his white washed house . a poor little rich boy , that was laurence . the times when laurence was allowed to leave his house were rare and when he was permitted to do so , he was only ever allowed to sit by the pond at the bottom of the garden . he sighed lightly and took in the golden sunbeams that were gently caressing his pasty skin . the large black and purple suitcases that hung below his eyes told the story of deprivation . but all that being said , he was still much better off than any brown eyed child . his parents , with their crystal blue eyes and golden hair , working for the government and earning a fortune . they could nt want for anything more , except for maybe , a normal son . see , laurence was different to most boys , lots of children in fact . laurence had two eyes that were different colours . one of his eyes were green , and then other a deep blue , almost navy . newline newline most children like laurence were sent away to institutions that held them in less than amicable conditions , keeping them hidden away from society . the government s secret children . laurence could hear the familiar voice of the old maid , calling him from the back door to summon him back to the house . he sighed and stood up , marching with his head down back toward the house , on his way back to his room . he passed the mad and nodded at her in acknowledgement . she smiled at him gracefully , lifting her wrinkled cheeks and accentuating the crows feet around her dark eyes . laurence had always enjoyed the company of anna , she was a gentle soul and never once judged laurence for his abnormally coloured eyes . newline newline  would you like some lunch , larry ?  anna asked , heading toward the kitchen . laurence looked up and nodded lightly newline newline  yes please , anna ,  laurence replied as the browneyed woman began drying her callused hands on her bleached white apron . laurence knew that anna had children of her own , but for some reason his parents would nt let her go home . they made her stay with their family and take on the role of laurence s mother . he always wondered what life would be like for anna s children , but he soon realised that their life would probably end up as hard as her own . laurence watched anna begin to slice the bread she had baked earlier in the morning and prepare him a sandwich . he leant his head against the wall , sighing at the artificial light that could never quite compensate for the real warming embrace of sunlight . newline newline  you know , larry ,  anna said , her voice laced with a happiness that floated through the corners of the room ,  my daughter is going to start working for your parents soon ,  a slight tinge of sadness , a feeling that tinted her voice bluer than her parents eyes , slipped into her voice as she spoke to laurence . he looked over at her and furrowed his brow . it did seem odd that the maid was telling him about her daughter coming to work for his parents , especially since in most of the house staff s minds , laurence did nt exist . it seemed rather pointless for laurence to know about yet another person that would never know of his existence . newline newline newline  she s excited ,  anna continued ,  she says that she ca nt wait to see what a real life blueeyed house looks like . she s only ever seen pictures at school , see ,  anna began cutting the sandwich in half , still smiling with her wrinkled eyes ,  she s 17 now . she s grown up so fast . you d like her , larry , she s very pretty . well , of course , i d say that . but she is . you know , for a browneyed girl .  laurence watched her cross the room and hand him a the sandwich on a plate . he smiled lightly and thanked her , disappearing away into his room , where he would inevitably stay for the rest of the afternoon until his parents returned and dismissed the staff , except for anna .i probably should have expected something like this to happen . newline newline ever since i d woken up two months ago with a raging hangover and the freakish ability to tell whether someone

she ended up in jail for murder . that was how i found myself sitting in my living room alone one sunny saturday morning , morosely staring at pictures of charlotte and i on the mantel and wondering what i d done to deserve all this . newline newline just then , the doorbell rang , and i sprang to my feet , instantly wary . sure , the weather was absolutely gorgeous out , but that did nt mean someone with ill intentions could nt have come knocking . slowly i went to the door , peeking out cautiously through the peephole . i could nt see anyone .  who is it ?  i called . newline newline  terence ,  a familiar voice warbled .  it s grandma ! i brought you cookies .  newline newline with a surge of relief , i remembered that she had invited herself over to drop off some of her worldclass homemade cookies . i had nt seen her since the freaky began , and i looked forward to eating those cookies again . newline newline almost subconsciously , i wondered what her aura would be like , as i did with every new person i met , and decided that it must be something very close to white . after all , this was my grandma , right ? but i got the shock of my life when i opened the door smiling to see her familiar figure standing there , clothed in an eerie aura of glowing jet black . newline newline i lost the smile at that , heart racing as i took an involuntary step back . though i d met dozens , no , hundreds of people since the freaky , i had never met someone with an aura this black .  uh ...  newline newline  are you alright , terrence ?  grandma asked in her native mandarin , offering me a smile as she stepped past me into the house . the warmth of her presence , and the constant smile she wore , juxtaposed the evil nature of her aura so strongly i felt a little like puking . newline newline  i m fine ,  i stammered , purely and terrifyingly bewildered . following my grandmother around the house in a daze while she commented on literally everything   i like the color of these bathroom walls !   , i scrambled for a logical explanation . maybe i had nt gotten enough sleep last night . maybe i was hallucinating . maybe i was wrong , and a black aura as pure as this one meant the same as a pure white one , though i d never seen either . newline newline until today , that is . newline newline as time wore on and grandma bustled around , i began convincing myself that her aura was nothing but a fluke , ignoring the primal instinct inside me that was screaming for me to run . pushing it down as hard as i could , i began to relax enough to make light conversation with my grandmother like i always had . newline newline she was about to leave when it happened . putting on her shoes , she d said goodbye to me at the door and turned to adjust her hat in the nearby mirror . i was watching her idly , and so i caught it  as the light shifted , the eyes of her reflection suddenly flickered from gentle brown into a fierce , terrifying black as dark as her otherworldly aura . newline newline i could nt stifle my gasp of terror , but when grandma turned around questioningly , her eyes were as kind as ever . but this time , even as i watched her walk away to her car , i could nt shake my belief that something was nt quite right about her . newline newline two weeks later , by the time the fiasco with my grandmother had long slipped my mind , my mother and father were found dead in their home , both murdered brutally by someone with a knife . at the crime scene , stricken and grieving , i saw something glinting in one of the police officer s hand . an earring , he said , proof of the killer . newline newline the moment i realized whose it was , a warm hand landed on my shoulder . newline newline when i turned around , my grandmother s eyes met mine , as black and as sinister as a midnight shadow . i could feel my eyes widen of their own will as she smiled . newline newline newline newlineit made the most noise in the bathroom . whatever it was bounced across the rings of the shower curtain when i painted makeup on . it would watch from the seat of the toilet bowl when i brushed my teeth . the ghost was vigilant  as an ectoplasm hobbyist , i m familiar with all kinds of ways to get rid of a haunter . that s never been my goal i want to understand it , speak to it , train it to haunt that dumb broad in 14f who keeps blasting miley cyrus above me . you had to be careful when you wanted a haunter to stick around , though . newline newline the first rule of ghost training is to never let them know you know they are there . you must make them suspicious enough to be caught off guard but not so weary they are too paranoid to come out . it all has to look like an accident until that fateful moment you slip an ectovibrator watch on them and they are yours for the taking . today was the day marrissa would do just that to her feline bathroom friend . newline newline she started putting on makeup . a quick brush of blush on her cheek ... and the slow rattling of shower curtains let her know the haunter was there . careful to not draw attention , she pulled the bottle of talcum powder up while still rubbing in the blush and humming  wrecking ball  andsneeze ! she squeezed the bottle burping a fresh blast of white powder over the shower . a large fourlegged mass of white leaped on to the toilet seat for safety when she fell into the other trap marrissa had left blue toilet bowl cleaner . the cat s paws would show everywhere if it even touched the water sure enough , it was the very first thing it went for . newline newline marrissa grabbed the ectoband off the bathroom counter , it was hidden in the makeup bag and slapped it across the haunter s neck . one down , only miley cyrus to go .every superhero has some kinda backstory . superman came from some alien planet , batman s some rich kid who lost his ma and pa . i m pretty damn sure someone got dropped in radioactive sludge , but your guess is as good as mine there . i did nt have any radioactive sludge , and i m damn happy to be cancer free . i m gon na tell you what i suspect . this is something i ve never told anyone , not even my ma . i d expect her to lose her head laughin  if i told her . but , i think god wants order . i think he never wanted this to happen . no government bigger than a few hundred square miles . more bandits than people to defend from them . it s like somebody gave the world rabies and it s gone mad . naw , god wants order , and i am his order made manifest . now , i ai nt got odc , or whatever , so i m not that kind of order . the order i bring is that i win . plain and simple . no chaos or rabies or nothing if that s it . i m not no crazy either . i ve met moren my fair share of crazies round here who call themselves angels or chosen ones . i ve taken fiat as my name , and right here s my story . newline newline my pa told me this one , makes him laugh like no other . when i was born , the midwife picked me up to spank me . but , i or whatever force anature that s got my back decided that was nt gon na happen . so she moves to hit my behind but she misses , knocks herself right out . i did nt get dropped , neither . landed right on top of the poor lady , comfy as can be . cause fiat ai nt lose nor get hit , not by nobody . newline newline ai nt never been sick before , neither . back when the shakepop was spreading i did nt get it .  we called it that cause if you got it first you shook then you threw up and leaked some nasty stuff outa your ears , nose , and eyes . like if you shake a bottle of pop . shakepop . fuck off , nobody thought my name was no good neither but i m sticking by it .  damn near got half the town , and finished off a good quarter of em . well , after two or three sicknesses pulled through the town and i still did nt get sick , people thought something was up . they saw i was nt average . i did nt get sick . so they put me on fucking clean up duty . somebody throw up ? get fiat to pick it up , he wo nt get sick . somebody get sick and die ? fiat . wan na see if the gun somebody found ll shoot or explode or what ? fiat . you d best bet this piper got paid , cause ai nt nobody that s got one up on fiat . newline newline people started thinkin  something was real off durin the lotto . see , if we find somethin that nobody s got any real claim to , we draw a lotto . i was in the lotto five times . i won five times in a row , out of some 300 people . they wised up soon , took my name out , and gave me something every 300 or so lottos to make it fair . newline newline here s the damned best proof i do nt lose . i ve had a gun to my head three times . two over a girl  the same  and the third over food several days deep into the desert . first one nearly made me shit me pants . real mean guy , knew me for years but was gon na kill me like a hog . so he shoots , and i m cradling my head and crying , saying some prayer to god or ma or both . he s lookin  at me and i look up , and now we re both staring at each other . he shoots again , and i flinch real hard . but , still nada . he empties his clip and i got this me shaped outline of bullet holes . when he and i realized his gun did nt work on me , i chased him around town , whooping his sorry ass . do nt tell me he was a shitty shot , though . i ve seen this guy hunt . the second time , he drops the gun , and the third time the gun turned out to be a very convincing plastic gun . made the other guy piss himself , cause according to him it had shoot well just two days ago . newline newline so , fiat do nt lose but that do nt mean everybody ca nt lose . we got plague , famine , war , and more death than we need around here . ma and pa died when i was 19 . bandits , and if it were nt bandits it woulda been sickness eventually . i gutted those rabbits and brought back what they stole . but you ca nt steal back lives , not from bandits anyhow . it s not about lettin  someone fuck you up and getting revenge . it s about making sure no one fucks you up . so , while i m always safe , i m making damn sure everyone else is too . that s why i m going as far as i can walk , talking to everybody that ll listen , uniting every city , town , and hermit i can find . we got ta unite , push the bandits out , and then we re good . then we got order so we can stop the sickness , stop the wars , stop the famines , stop the deaths . the four horsemen done came , but we can tell em to leave . so , what say you ? you and me , your town and my town , let s work together .a beat up chevy pulls into my driveway as i prepare myself for what could happen this weekend . the nature side of me has always wanted to go camping . i mentioned it to my friends a few times , but way before i came to terms with what my , and only my life is . i always had the feeling i was being watched . when i would close my eyes and try to sleep , when i stepped into the shower every second the hot water ran down my face i was afraid to shut my eyes in fear of what i would see when i opened them . fortunately , no one , no thing ever attempted to harm me . doors were always shutting when no one else was home though , shadows always appeared on the walls ... .and then i saw him . after years of begging my parents to stay home at night time they got sick of the routine and left me in my house all alone . it was halloween and i had nt made any plans but to baby sit my neighbors daugher . newline newline  casey  she said newline newline  yes ?  newline newline  someones here ...  her voice changed it s tone , and a song began . a ridiculous disney style , life is great song . newline newline i looked out the doorway to find a man in a painters suit and weird halloween mask staring back at me . i survived the night and based of the slasher films i ve seen , its because i m a virgin but still ... the feeling of being watched never left me . newline newline one of the movies i saw , there was a guy in a hockey mask killing teenagers at some camp ... he was supernatural or something . so yeah , i m a little nervous to go camping , what if that guy who came last halloween comes back again ? then what ... my friends start singing as a knife pierces through my skin , cause their world is perfect and mine is just some fcked up horror movie ? i ditched my friends a little too much this year though , the camp base looks pretty nice and safe . i would have felt bad if i said no to something i wanted to do . newline newline i open my front door just in time for my three friends to finish their musical number . i do nt get why they always do that , no ones watching them ... is life really that great they have to sing about it all the damn time ? newline newline  hey marie  i call , walking towards the car . newline newline she calls my name back enthusiastically , adding a nice wave . newline newline though her boyfriend , tyler jumping off the roof of the car as part of his routine is attention grabbing i can  t help but notice an odd figure next to the bushes across the street . next to marie now , i ask if she see  s it too . newline newline  i don  t see anything , why are you so paranoid all the time ?  she says turning away and into the car . newline newline i look again but find there is nothing there . newline newline driving off my street i can  t help but look out the back window . nothing appears like i expect so instead i try to relax . newline newline as we pull up to the camp site the sky is not as bright , in fact in the distance smoke can be seen , a lot of it too . the four of us hop out of the car into the camp that wreaks of smoke . newline newline  here we are  tyler coughs ,  camp crystal lake  newline newline why does that sound so damn familiar ?  newline newline the three of them go into another musical number , despite the difficult attempt to breath . in the far off distance it looks as though the trees on fire are spelling out something . newline newline  and so the trees did spell out something michael vs. jason  newline newline seconds later all smoke and fire disappear out of thin air as if it had not happened . weird . newline newline  did you guysdid that happen for you guys tooor  i attempt to ask newline newline  sing along !  matt calls out newline newline  guess not . camp crystal lakewhy does that sound like i  ve heard it before ?  newline newline  camp crystal lake ? it  s pretty popular.  marie answers newline newline  why ?  i ask newline newline  becauseof legends  she smiles at me newline newline  legends ? ? ? like what kind of legends ?  i worry newline newline the only definition i know for legend is , psychokiller legend has itjason voorhees , supernatural killer roams around..camp.. newline  shit !  i say out loud .  we should go  i propose newline newline  no ! we came here for you we  re gon na have fun ! i was kidding there  s no legends . it  s funny that you think someones following you all the time , no ones following you.  newline newline  i didn  t mention my stalker.who is real by the way.  i yell newline newline it doesn  t take long for the sun to set , and so my three friends and i find ourselves inside our cabin bored out of our minds . rain begins to lightly tap on the window , but then more heavily . marie and tyler silently get up from the table and make their way to the bedroom they claimed . newline newline  we  re tired  tyler fake yawns .  see you in the morning ?  newline newline  hopefully  i reply . newline newline matt and i look down at our phones a short while before we decide it is too early to be sleeping . i hadn  t mentioned to them before but i couldn  t help but shake the feeling there was someone roaming outside our cabin . now that it was just him and i , him less judgmental than marie and tyler i decided to speak on it . newline newline  have you noticed the creeks on the porch make every few minutes ?  i whisper newline newline he shakes his head , no . newline newline  are you a virgin ?  i whisper again , knowing this will grab his attention . newline newline  are you ?  he smiles newline newline  seriously , yes or no matt.  newline newline  ..no  newline newline  someones here , and by some scientific law that i have yet to comprehend , if you  re not lying you  re gon na die tonight.and so are they , we need to get the hell out of here.  newline newline from across the room , where marie and tyler lay a loud crashing sound interrupts our conversation . it sounds like it was glass , the window probably followed by their screams . matt and i run to the other room as our friends attempt to run out . our reality slows down for a second though , and a piano begins to play soft background music . the hands of my stalker back home grab onto tyler  s leg , dragging him slowly . marie reaches her hand out to grab her loves for one last time , and begins to sing a ballad . my stalker and i look at each other too , in confusion and fear . time speeds up again and the man in a painter overalls rips tyler away . the remainder of us run as fast as we can towards the front door but before i can open it a machete tears through the door . jason , the legend , the psychokiller has his hand wrapped around the other side of the weapon . he does not seem to be concerned with the three of us , but the killer across the room . they both just stand there for a quick second , then a battle begins . we do not take this opportunity to stand and watch but run out into the pouring rain in hopes of survival . newline newline marie stops in the middle of the woods ,  casey..i  m sorry  newline newline  about what ? ?  matt yells , anxiously and afraid . newline newline  there really was a legend.  a piano begins to play faintly in the background again newline newline  marie !  i yell newline newline she continues to sing , ignoring my call to her newline newline  he  s right behind you !  i yell again newline newline drenched in rain and mud i watch my best friend mercilessly killed at the hands of a horror movie killer and i know for sure nowthat is what my life isa moviea form of entertainment for kids bored on the weekendson halloweenfilm enthusiasts and i  m a victim , it  s never going to end is it ? newlineit s dead , and we are the killers . newline newline but what we have killed is not a being , an object , or anything that exists in our reality . what we have killed is an idea , one that use to bring people together , kill uncountable numbers of people , and destroy other ideas in the fear that it itself may be destroyed . newline newline what killed it was not the blade of a weapon , nor the speed of a bullet , rather it was crushed by the massive amount of knowledge now available to any and all to see . sure , it screamed so that all could hear it s demand for them to save it , but few thought it was worth saving . newline newline sure , it did help in the beginning to  know  what was out there , and sure , the concept of an afterlife is more appealing than nothing after death . but humanity has grown up . we have learned that most , if not all , questions can be answered with a set of patterns , and that  bad  people usually are not put in more pain than  good  people , with some the the  bad  being masters of manipulation , controlling others with ideas such as the idea of a deity who punishes those who defy it , and reward those who follow it . newline newline and as the idea of god dies , another idea will take it s place . an idea that will bring all together  an idea where all can be happy , no matter what their preferences  an idea where earth is worth preserving  an idea that values intelligence and intellectualism  an idea that values creativity and freedom for all  an idea where you do nt have to think the same to be friends  an idea where people are not constantly scared of their leaders  an idea where the unexplained is not blamed on a fictional being , rather the unexplained is studied so that it can be explained . this is the idea of an ideal world . and in this world , there is always hope on the horizon , and opportunity at your feet . newline newline but , work needs to be done before humanity can experience this ideal reality , and we can start with the acceptance of all proven scientific theories , along with the acceptance that we will never truly be able to explain everything .i should be dead . but i m not . there are other thoughts , but these are foremost in my mind as i stumble back to camp . he betrayed me , wounded me . but he did nt kill me . that was a mistake , for now i will destroy him . newline newline he s taunting me . he can fly , but he leaves tracks . he can vanish into the darkness , but every traveler or village we pass has seen him . he s leading me somewhere . this is a game to him . he wo nt be laughing for long though , and if i m lucky i ll catch both of them at the same time . to kills at once , and then i will be unopposed . newline newline of course , when i find him it s on his terms . he finds it amusing to meet people at their most vulnerable , which for me appears to be while i m shitting . he stands there , watching me . he knows i ve seen him , of course . he just wants to watch my reaction . i ll give him one he wo nt forget for the short time he lives . i suppose i should be grateful he considers himself infallible , otherwise he would nt have left me alive when he betrayed me . perhaps he s come to finish the job , perhaps he just wants to taunt me some more . thing is though , i m smarter than him . i m not actually shitting . just need to lure him a bit closer now ... newline newline  you should have killed me when you had the chance !  newline newline he s stood up , no cloak today it seems . so far so good . newline newline  and deprive myself of the research opportunities you provide ?  newline newline yep , taunting me . he s not coming towards me , but he never backs up . maybe i can get toward him without him getting suspicious . i bend over , as if forcing something particularly large out , and slide my feet forwards a little . he does nt notice . a few more times , and i ll be close enough . newline newline  you would keep living if you had killed me . now i will kill you .  newline newline  it is the nature of humans to hope . by all means keep doing so , if only to entertain me .  newline newline  you think you re a god , dont  newline newline  i am no god !  newline newline did i just get a reaction ? i was nt expecting that . he s stepped forward , more than close enough now . time to put this thing to use . newline newline bang newline newline i ll have a bruise on my stomach now , but it was worth it . he falls . being immune to mental attacks and resistant to lightning and fire is impressive , but not much good against a fast piece of metal . definitely was worth pressuring that alchemist . i stand , and walk over to where he lies . he s still alive , but pale and clutching his wound . i lean down over him . newline newline  you either kill your foe , or keep them under control . leaving them to their own devices is a tactical error . not that i mind my enemies making mistakes , though this was the last one you ll ever make .  newline newline i bring the device up , towards his head , for the finishing blow . newline newline  a tactical error can be a strategic advantage .  newline newline he does nt seem afraid , but he must be . an image of power does nt hold up well when you re lying on the ground clutching your stomach . he ca nt have much breath left , and i need to strain to catch his whisper . newline newline   i did nt kill you because i need him to .   newline newline and i am stabbed in the back . newline newline i lie dying , and they have left . perhaps i will live , and pain . so much pain . no more rage , my breathing is slowing . as i die , i hear a man s voice . newline newline  this is nt what i wanted  newline newline  newline newline read more of my stories at rghotioninabarrelit almost seemed as if today would come and go as any other , untouched by fate and destined to pass unnoticed . it was a frigid day , and terry could almost hear his chapped lips crack in the bitter winter air . he stepped into his car and pulled out his mobile phone . newline newline  call sarah.  newline newline  calling sarah , mobile or home ?  newline newline  mobile.  newline newline he pushed in the electric lighter in his car and pulled a marlboro out of his pack , the heat had gone out of his car and his cigarette was the only warm thing about his drive home . newline newline  hello ?  newline newline  hey , it  s me . you cooking dinner ?  newline newline  no , i didn  t have time to get to the store today.  newline newline  okay then , i was wondering if you  d like to try something new today . sully told me about a great new thai place on the corner of court st.  newline newline  do you really think the kids are going to eat thai ?  newline newline  oh it  s good for them , and eric and abby need to learn to appreciate different things , we can  t very well have spaghetti or chicken nuggets every night.  newline newline  fine , but you have to drive.  newline newline  fine by me , see you soon . love you.  newline newline he rounded a corner , and cracked his window . he didn  t want the car to smell like smoke  after all he had to set an example for eric and abby . newline newline he drew his last on the half finished cigarette before flicking it out the window . as he pulled in the drive he reached into the console , and pulled out an aerosol and quickly covered the scent . he idled in the driveway until he saw his wife open the door and his two children waddle outside , dressed as warm as marshmallows . newline newline sarah sat the kids into the car , and then herself . she leaned over and pecked terry on the cheek as he pulled out of the drive . newline newline it wasn  t long before they arrived at the new restaurant . the exterior was reminiscent of an oriental palace , and the parking lot was small but full . terry smiled as his children marveled at the large decorative door that separated them from the warm restaurant inside . terry opened the door and his wife and kids filed in . newline  welcome to palm thai , how many ?  newline newline  four please.  newline newline  right this way.  newline newline the kids led the way while he and sarah followed behind . she wrapped her arm around his and pulled herself closer and whispered ,  she has pretty good engl  newline newline  sarah ! don  t be rude.  newline newline  it  s not rude . i  m impressed.  newline newline terry sighed as sarah slid into the booth . they began looking over the menu , and they soon placed their order . the staff was incredibly friendly and even offered various samples . newline newline  try this , spicy egg roll with yummy sauce.  newline newline  i don  t want to !  abby cried . sarah shot a glance toward her that was firm but loving . newline newline  abby dear , just eat it . try something new i promise it  ll be delicious.  she said as she dipped the roll in the sauce and took a bite . newline newline  see ,  she began ,  it  s delicious !  newline newline abby looked wary but after eric reached over and grabbed one of the egg rolls she decided she would too . terry  s eyes were so intent on abby and eric he didn  t even notice his wife . newline newline  come on guys , go ahead . eat it.  abby looked nervous and she looked up at her mother for reassurance . her nervous face evolved into terror . newline newline  daddy , what  s mommy doing ?  newline newline sarah  s face was red , almost purple and she was beginning to dry heave . newline newline  oh god , your epipen , where is your epipen sarah ?  he grabbed , the waitress passing by ,  are there peanuts in the yummy sauce ?  newline newline  we cook everything in peanut oil , sir.  newline newline  damn it , where  s the epipen sarah ?  she pointed at her purse . terry reached over and grabbed the purse and began digging through it wildly . newline newline  it  s not in here . it  s not home is it ?  sarah nodded in a panic . newline newline  put your coats on kids , we  re leaving.  terry hurried his kids and wife into the car and sped , red light through red light rushing to the pharmacy . newline newline he helped sarah out of the car , and hurried her through the door . newline newline  somebody help us ! i need an epipen !  newline newline the pharmacist looked at him , and then at sarah . his eyes widened ,  yeah of course !  newline newline the manager seemed to hear this and hurried over to the pharmacist . terry could barely hear him ask if he checked them for a prescription . after a little arguing the manager coolly looked over and said ,  i  m sorry sir , but we require a prescription for epipens . do you have one on you ?  newline newline  look at my wife you idiot , just give us the damn epipen !  the manager was obviously shocked , but he was compliant . he walked between the shelves , and came back empty handed . newline newline  i  i  m sorry it appears we  re out of them at the moment . we can  t help any customer  s without a prescription anyway.  newline newline i don  t know if she gave up after hearing that the pharmacy was out of epipens , or if she just didn  t have enough air , but with the bad news sarah fell to the ground . the sound of her head cracking against the ground obviously affected the pharmacist . he ran to the back and came back with an epipen in hand . the manager grabbed his arm , newline newline  they don  t have a prescription , do you want to lose your license ?  newline newline the pharmacist shook free and ran to sarah , he jabbed her in the thigh with the pen . terry and the pharmacist waited patiently for a sign , for her to breathe deeply and come out of it . seconds felt like minutes , and seconds revealed the blood pooling under her auburn hair . newline newline  ssarah ? damn it , call an ambulance , something !  newline newline he reached for her neck , and felt her pulse .  sarah don  t do this to me , don  t do this . sarah wake up honey , wake up baby.  newline newline the moment her blue eyes went gray carved itself into his memory like a bright light against morning eyes , and he knew  sarah was gone . newlinehe stares at me , unblinking . i have sat across this table from dozens upon dozens of men and women and i ve seen all of them react the same : nervously . but now , with the ripper actually , finally in custody his calm was the first thing i noticed . and it left me unsettled . still unsettled . after another moment , i decide that i should repeat my question ... newline newline but before i can , he finally speaks , cutting me off .  let me assure you , constable , i have absolutely no regret over what has transpired over the course of my indulgence in sport .  newline newline  sport ? you find taking innocent lives to be a game .  newline newline  oh , most certainly . think of it . tracking , stalking and finally striking at the right moment . exhilarating !  newline newline his cavalier stance on murdering people and especially women aside , it s his demeanor i find most discomfiting . meanwhile , i notice he s looking at me more intently , staring in search of a chink in my armor .  but you got careless .  newline newline  did i ? is that how you really see this situation ?  newline newline  you re locked in this building and in this room with me .  finally , he blinks and stands .  sit back down , sir ,  i say , as sternly as i can muster . newline newline  no , constable . you are locked in here . with me .  newline newline he moves closer , never taking his eyes off me . i feel a sharp pang of terror surge through my body . dear god , how did we miss that knife ?blank . that s the only memory that came to mind when he tried to think back . he could nt remember how he got here , or where here was even for that matter . newline newline the noises of the outside world were masked by a deafening whir in his head . fragrance of burning hair filled his nostrils , it did nt take long to find the source : he was completely bald . head to toe his hair had been singed clean off , yet his skin had no abrasions or burns . to add to the sensory overload , four of his teeth tasted of metal . newline newline that s when the chill hit him . his final sense came to and completed the surrounding picture about him . the landscape was blanketed with the covering of fresh snow . trees stood frozen in time in an artful pose , the falling snow dampened any noise the forest would have been making . newline newline all but the immediate area around him was a pure white . there was a carved  no , burned  perfectly shaped circle about him . the circle seemed to suffer the same fate as his singed hair . newline newline that s when he felt it , the coolness in his hand . though the air was cold , he felt something freeze his fingers . he lifted up his dominant arm and studied the object . newline newline he dropped it immediately , as his senses started becoming more acute , the frigid , oddly shaped rock was making him colder . he shivered and held himself , while he look for sign of help . newline newline the silence of the forest was broken by the thundering of something ... he was nt sure what , but it was either big , or there was a lot of it .  newline newline it was getting louder and louder and closer . newline newline fearing for his life he instinctively grabbed his rock hid behind the closest tree . the thundering was deafening now , he was sure the noise had reached the apex of its intensity , but it continued to grow louder and louder . finally it stopped , the steady beat of that loud drum had finished . the noise , however , was replaced with incoherent blabbing of something . newline newline the naked man turned his head from around the tree and saw them , the creatures . he could nt remember how to count , but to him , it seemed there were more of them than there were fingers or toes on his body . newline newline they were horrible in appearance . four long leg protruded from their horizontal torso . a head ? seemed to be sticking out of their stomach . it turned and made noises , a some of the beasts seemed to be eating the grass below the snow . newline newline their upper half was clad in some sort of protective shell . the upper half s mid section was covered and arms sprang out from the sides . his eyes moved upwards , studying the beasts . a final piece of shell covered the top of the upper section . this part was another head , it seemed , its eyes were intelligent , smart , and scheming . newline newline that must be the real head , he felt , the other was a decoy . he discovered that the shells were used to cover important pieces . newline newline one of the creatures turned its real head and spotted him , it called out to its companions and lifted up its arm , erecting a finger in his direction . newline newline  yees durr !  it cried ,  yenen da tree .   the last word stuck out in his mind . like a post it note of a lost reminder , he suddenly remembered that word . newline newline tree ,  he thought , looking at the the thing that had previously concealed him . newline newline in his sudden grasp of what he would eventually remember as  language ,  he failed to notice the circle of beasts around him . the creatures had put themselves on all sides , preventing his escape . newline newline the tallest creature came forward , it must have been strongest for it clad the most protective skin . newline newline  yoo dar you ?   it said inquisitively . newline newline  yan you yerndestn nee ?  it continued . the naked man could not remember out the words . newline newline  who are you  it said again . yes , he understood this now . the words were coming back to him , he could comprehend but he could not find the power to speak . newline newline he had no idea how these creatures spoke , or how he understood their queer tongue . in response , all he could do was utter out a grunt and shiver . newline newline the creature looked back to a lesser one and yelled for something . newline newline the one it called back to became two . the naked man could not comprehend it . at first it seemed as though the beast had been sliced in half  he waited for both halves to fall over dead , but it never happened . the top half , the half that he thought contained the real head walked behind it s first half . newline newline from a pouch it took out the hide of something , someone ? the thought of wearing something else s skin disgusted him , so naturally he flinched backwards when the halfbeast came at him . he had no where to run so eventually he accepted the skin . newline newline still clutching his rock , he felt the warmth of his body contained . the cold no longer bit at his naked flesh . the hide he wore kept him warm . newline newline the largest creature said something again and three more of the beasts halved themselves . newline newline they came towards him with what he perceived as sinister intent . one held a long vine while another another pouch , large enough for his real head to fit in he supposed . newline newline  dun run nio , ya neeer ?  one said at him . newline newline he knew not what they had planned , partly conflicted by the generous gesture of the skin and by their now evil eyes . newline newline  fight or flight .  he d later recall when telling his story ,  that s what i had to do , fight or flight . they ousted option two with their surrounding circle , so i did nt have a whole lot of choices .  newline newline instinctively , he raised his rock towards a man . that seemed to make them stop . he felt a tentative easiness , hoping they d back off . newline newline the creatures looked at one another then let out an inperceivable cry . it rose and fell in volume and intensity . one of the three men clutched his torso and fell . newline newline the naked man looked his rock , captivated by it s mystical powers . it seemed to stop the evil beasts and now there was one on the ground , perhaps poisoned or borken . with renewed effort he took a step forward and pointed his rock at another man . newline newline they howled again , the previously silent forest was now filled with their cries . newline newline the man on the ground was still moving , his teeth were gnashing as he slowly got to his feet . he wiped water from his eyes . newline newline  wert you seenk thats nunna do ?   it asked inquisitively . newline newline it was all a ruse . the men were back on their feet this time , only now they spread their red lips over yellowed teeth . he felt helpless now , surrounded by halfbeasts , and continued to clutch his rock . newline newline he gripped it tight , not wanting to lose it . gripping it tight in anger and in frustration . he squeezed his fingers around it and closed his eyes . he cried out in another feeble attempt to frighten his captors and felt the cold rock bite at his fingers , then his hands , then his arm . his felt his dominant arm shake violently . newline newline another cry joined his own , louder and more sudden , with more intensity and an air of demanded respect . then it was over , in the instant it started , it had finished . newline newline birds chirped a single solitary note in the forest . it was weird to hear them now , and not before , he wondered . he looked around  among the fear and clamoring and yelling  he looked for the birds but saw nothing . newline newline then he realized the birds were in his own head . the chirping was his own ears , he stuck fingers in the holes on the side of his head to confirm his finding . newline newline he looked up now , realizing things were still happening around him . the three men that previously advanced towards him were down to two . the two remaining were anxiously backing away . their eyes wide with fear of a larger predator . newline newline the third man was lying down . his arms and legs splayed out . a hole marked the center of his forehead as red fluid flowed out behind him . the puddle of red grew increasingly large as it tainted the once perfect snowfall . newline newline the would be captors were frightened now . several turned tail and ran , the two that had attempted to take him had now joined back with their bottom half . newline newline the alpha was shouting back at this creatures . it seemed to instill the courage back in the ones that remained . newline newline it eyed the naked man and spoke . newline newline  die .   newline newline itslid his talon from its hiding place and began to run towards the naked man . newline newline he did his trick again , he pointed his rock at the beast s head , the real head , and squeezed . newline newline the roar rang through the forest again , this time with his eyes open he saw flames erupt from the rock . blinding light illuminated the trees in false colors as the rock barked at the charging creature . newline newline by some mystical force , he creature was struck with jarring intensity . his top half slunk backwards and fell separate from the bottom half , which did not stop running into the forest . newline newline the naked man looked back at the riders now , what was left at them , and cried out his own roar of dominance . advancing towards them and pointing his rock he cried ,  die , die , die , die , die !  newline newline the men lost their courage and ran , leaving the naked man alone . newline newline alone except for his rock . he eyed it with gleeful wonder . newline newline the naked man took his rock and began his journey .dear lovely wife . newline newline i ve been in hell the past year . i am hoping to come home soon . newline newline i miss you and rachel  daughter s name i guess ?  . newline newline tell her , if i do nt make it home in time , when she s 12 , that i love her , and the reason i never came home from my  business trip  is because i ... died . newline newline tell her to never join the war . it s ugly . it s awful . it s nearly ruined my previously loving , kind soul . newline newline i feel like i m around a bunch of animals . hunting to kill others . it sucks . newline newline i lov ...  there s a blood splat on the word love , and then the killer finishes it  newline newline he loves you . newline newline i m so sorry . i ve ended his life . newline newline please , know that i never hated him or any of his men . i was nt fired at first , but it was simply my orders by my general . i m so , so sorry .  the paper is wet from some tears  newline newline i feel so awful . i ve cried on this paper . newline newline my other soldiers called me a softie and a pussy , but that s something i m not . i have empathy . i m so sorry . newline newline you ll see him again one day , for he was a good man . he is up in heaven . newlinewe never saw it coming to be fair . newline newline  sir ! they are breaching !  newline newline it s those little details that we never paid attention to that in the end turned out to be our outdoing . newline newline  we can not let them leave ! even if it means going down here with the whole complex .  newline newline see , no one really tought that the place was habitated , no one really bothered to imagine that maybe , just maybe it was nt buried , but sealed . we really should have had some kind of medical protocol for it , yet , everyone was so excited ! newline newline   it s some new ruins ! imagine the history behind them !  said the scholars . newline newline   this is part of us property , we must claim the technology on it .  said the public workers . newline newline   i m pretty sure there aztec zombies on it .  said some idiot on the internet . newline newline oh boy how was it turned on us . newline newline  run ! just keep going ! ignore the fallen , there s not saving them !  newline newline  they keep coming out of the walls ! seal the exit ! .  newline newline you see , this place was nt part of humanity per se , it was in earth long ago , that s goddamn for sure , but we could have never guessed that it was nt human . newline newline this place was the start of everything bad in the course of history , we found records of diseases that were spread mid the last century and even farther than that , records of events on humanity s history that were seemingly lost to time . newline newline this place was here to develop us , to use us as an experiment , you know what s the worst part ? we could understand it because it was written in some kind of root of latin . newline newline that s right , they taught us , they grew us and let us be as we are , i ... i do nt think there s such thing as a god ... it s ... . it s a control thing , they kept us believing that we were the ones in chage and the ones that kept coming up with these amazing ideas , electricity ! internet , fucking writting . writting for god s sake ! yet , it was all a big joke , some kind of alien race took it upon them to use us as guinea pigs , to grow the perfect labrats . newline newline newline you know , in hindsight , they really should have seen this one coming . newline newline  the charges are set ! ready to go in three !  newline newline this place was nt just  buried in ice  , no my friend , this place was sealed , they never tought of us coming up with something as complicated as the atomic bomb , they really looked down on our destrutive behaviour . newline newline  blow it !  newline newline we never developed the atomic bomb to kill of the japs , hell no , this was made to finish them off , to seal them and blow them the fuck up , i mean sure , the degradation they suffered after that was a total conterblow , sure as hell that this zombie thing was nt in the plans . newline newline  there it goes !  newline newline but i m smiling as i die , because i know that we just beat them for the second time . newline newline so how do i kill a god ?  a being , neither male nor female , asked . newline newline their companion pondered upon this for a moment , then the companion smiled and ,  so how do you kill a god , you ask ?  their companion wore a sardonic grin ,  it s quite simple , you take away the people s belief in him , you disregard his works ... and then you put him on display , naked , for everyone to see .  newline newline the being nodded before posing another question , newline newline  but do they remain dead ?  newline newline  who knows ?  the companion shrugged . newline newline the being frowned ,  what of the egyptian gods ? the nordic ? the greeks ? the romans ? the japanese ? the indians ? the chinese ? every other gods for every religion that came ?  newline newline  what of them ? they re nothing but myths . their believers are gone and they are relics of past civilization .  newline newline silence ensued between them , there within the ruins of a once great building of worship were two beings engage in one last exchange . the night had arrived because the place where they are was facing away from the sun  not because of two wolves chasing each other , nor a goddess riding her chariot across the sky  , there was no one else but them in the ruins . finally the companion spoke , newline newline  is that all you ve got to asked ?  newline newline the being frowned , they had not anticipated such a behaviour from a fading god . they had expected despair , and anger for being replaced not this indifferent acceptance . newline newline  why ?  newline newline  why what ?  newline newline  why do you not rage ?  they clarified . newline newline and the now fading god , laughed loudly , mockingly at the being in front of him , and then this god who had been forgotten smiled at the being in front of him with pity as he spoke , newline newline  the moment you ve existed for as long as i have you d understand that nothing lasts for long , one day once they have gotten tired of you they shall find something new to believe in .  newline newline and then he laid back down in the earth , his head rested on the rock upon which the first foundation of his home , the place where he was venerated , and closed his eyes . gone was his godly visage , instead of the indescribable beauty depicted in stories , what lay in front of the new god was a very human looking male , with hollowed cheeks and dirtied body . newline newline the new god stared at it for a long time and thought , newline newline i shall never be killed so long as i am believed in .  newline newline and so the new god left the ruins of a forgotten religion and set out to meet their believers , they shall preach and leave verses , just so their believer may never leave and stop believing in their godliness . and if anyone dares to question them , newline newline i ll just punish them . there was an oil smudge on the glass surface of the synthetic womb . newline newline ronnie grunted , set down his heatvac where it stood , careful to make a mental note of his sweep across the floor so that he would nt lose his place , and stepped over to the cold , frost steaming surface of unit 1906 . he leaned close to the reflective material and let out a long  haaaaaaah  . the warmth from his breath fogged over the glass , and he took out his rag , and ran it over the smooth , freezing , industrial grade polymer . newline newline the smudge was gone . newline newline ronnie sighed and slowly put his rag back into the left breast pocket of his navy blue janitorial uniform , a one piece jumpsuit that kept his body heat from dropping below freezing . he stood there for a moment . it was late , he thought , and he glanced over to his left , there , about 500 meters away , on the walls of big mother , warehouse b42 , was a holographic time display , with the large red digital numbers  23:23  on it . newline newline almost midnight . he sighed again . newline newline he always marveled that , however far away from the timepiece he was , it always seemed to be the same distance away from him . something to do with an optical illusion . newline newline he sighed a third time , hands on his hips .  i wish i was smart ,  he muttered , fully aware of the fact that he had nt returned to his cleaning . newline newline there was something about stopping in the middle of a routine , that made a person reluctant to go back to the same grind . the same way there was something about stopping in the middle of life , stuck in a dead end job , that made him want to just lie down and never get up . but while he was figuratively in his recline , he could at least look around and appreciate the sterile beauty of his surroundings , the superconductor plastigel flooring that carried electric currents into the endless columns of synthetic wombs around him , the solar panels on the ceiling that were just as good if not better than actual sunlight . newline newline and then he looked up and into unit 1906 , seemingly aware for the first time recognizing what was in front of him . the vat was about 5 meters tall , a transparent pillar filled with some viscous fluid greenish in tint . in the fluid floated a girl , respirator hooked up to her mouth , otherwise naked from the neck down . she was beautiful of course . ronnie had yet to see anyone not beautiful , man or woman , floating inside a vat . she was a perfect genetic specimen , of course , engineered to be immune from virtually every disease and ailment nature had ever invented , the athletic prowess of an olympic gymnast , the endurance of a long distance runner , and the strength of an average ursidae . he could see all this just in the shade of her skin , the lines of her tendons , the lean musculature on top of titanium strengthed bone structure . her flesh glowed occasionally beneath her skin , a purplish hue laced with occasional thin blue streaks that flashed and died like lightning . newline newline  i wish i was rich  , he muttered to himself , as he looked up into her face . newline newline behind the respirator , the only significant features he could discern were her cheekbones , her nose , and her eyes . her eyes were half open , of course , but dead in the sense that her optical nerves were being processed elsewhere , living out a fantastical life in some simulation of childhood , the parents only spending time with them in a fake world , until the cybernetic enhancements were complete . newline newline she would be about 16 , ronnie guessed . even with all the advances in bioengineering and nanotech , the full physical transformation would not finish until she was well after 18 . the parents , he thought , put a lot of investment into her , to make her nearly indestructible . he did nt blame them of course . children were precious , he knew , although only rhetorically , because he lacked the education to understand just how much . but he knew enough to know that they were too valuable to risk in the chaos of the real world . why , just last year , he dropped a floor buffer on his foot , and nearly had to get a replacement , for both of them . newline newline of course he would never have children himself . a mandatory operation at birth took away his ability . but he was ok with that . he had everything he could ever need , a decent apartment , a job that he enjoyed , even if it went nowhere . he even had a cat he took care of , someone who d be waiting for him at home . and then there were the games . every night he would spend his dreams in the hub , the virtual world that every person on the planet plugged into when they lay down to bed . it was probably not dissimilar to where the girl was right now . newline newline ronnie grew up in a vat like this too , although probably not as expensive , and without the cybernetic enhancements . he woke up when he was 14 , much younger than those who had the resources to complete their neural and physical modifications . as a ward of the state , he was bred only to serve as a genetic baseline for the rest of the population . something about genetic drift and disaster prevention , he remembered from one of his hub courses . but being a baseline was nt so bad . no one treated him differently in the hub . everyone was there to relax , and maybe create a nice story for themselves . newline newline he was halfway into remembering about his hub dream last night , skydiving off a cliff eight thousand miles high , when the communicator band around his wrist chirped . it would probably be his supervisor , george kent . newline newline  hello ?  he said into the thin elastic strap . newline newline  hey ronnie !  george s familiar voice greeted him .  almost midnight , buddy . how far did you get today ?  newline newline  hey , george .  ronnie answered , while walking back to his heatvac , he pressed a button on it and read the number on it .  oh about 40 meters .  newline newline  ah haha , keep getting caught up in your daydreams , do nt ya ?  george laughed . newline newline  yeah , you know me george , haha .  ronnie laughed sheepishly back at him . newline newline  well , no worries , buddy , we ll let the little tin buggers handle it .  there was a click on the end of the line , where george pressed a button , and inside the warehouse , the utility closets on the edges of the building slid open , and an entire army of robots , the size of dogs and cats , and even flying ones like mosquitoes droned out , filling the columns of empty space between the synthetic wombs , sucking up dirt , killing microbes , deionizing particles , and generally sanitizing the atmosphere . newline newline ronnie rolled up his heatvac and began walking toward his office at the other end of the giant room , 40 meters away . george was still talking to him on his wristband . newline newline  hey ronnie , might run into you in the hub tonight . heard there s a deer hunting game i ve been meaning to try out . it s right next to the sky diving station you always waste your time at .  newline newline  oh yeah ? maybe i ll see you on the way down .  ronnie said , wondering if he remembered to fill the cat s food dish this afternoon . she s gon na be angry at him if he did nt . but that was ok . he had the hub .a warm liquid flowed through my fingers . it was melted metal like the kind they use to make swords . i made a hella rad sword with it . it was called bifrost and it was hella tall , like twelve feet tall and it had spikes in the edges . newline newline i use the sword to chop rickys head off . when dr patterson comes and says no you cant do that its bad i will chop his head off too . then i will listen to japanese motor juggalo and my sword will be on fire . i will use the fire sword to burn the entire hospital .tomorrow was the day , my uncle told me i had to choose like he did . it was obvious which he had chosen since he only existed in big blue . that s what i called the place i currently was in . i had always called it big blue ever since i could remember , the reason was obvious to me now , thinking back on my childlike thoughts to name the place i had suddenly appeared in . apparently here the world had been too late to stop global warming and the poles had melted , but scientists were wrong on how much ice was truly at the poles . it had been enough to cover the entire planet besides a few places where the ground was high enough . some places in africa and the himalayas . here i enjoyed my time , i was muscular here , something caused by the constant swimming everyone does in case our floating cities suddenly sink . did i mention we lived on huge floating cities ? well that s what scientists came up with the ensure our survival , floating cities for the wealthy , you drowned if you did nt have enough money to pay your way to live here . life was slow there was nt much for me to do besides fish , surf and go to school . but this was my final year of school and after i would be required to choose where i want to study . the institute of technology where i could become a techie or maybe the school for home defense , where i could learn combat techniques and be a soldier and fight for our city . luckily we were all so scared that if there was a major war we would all blow up our cities and then drown to death , that kept us mostly in check . so life was slow but it was a nice existence . i could see why uncle john wanted to live here with his carefree attitude . he was the only one who believed me as a child when i told him i lived in a two places . he was the one who taught me everything about either world and he told me this day would come . newline newline well enough sitting around in bed , i got up and looked out of my window . the view of waves greeted my like usual . i grabbed a tshirt as i walked out of my room . mom and dad greeted me as i walked into the kitchen and sat down . breakfast was salmon , like always but salmon was good so i chowed it down . dad asked what my plans were for the big day tomorrow . i was confused on how he knew for a second then realized that it was my 18th birthday tomorrow to him it was just that , an 18th birthday , not the biggest decision of my life or anything . i had nt made any plans and i told him the same . i left in a hurry hoping to catch uncle john before he left for his daily surf session . as i walked i was greeted by sara and gwen . we chatted for a while about surfing later and maybe going to dinner . trivial things that i did nt have time for . i excused myself and ran to uncle john s . i caught him right as he was leaving . i needed guidance . uncle john just looked at me . he did nt say a word , he just kept walking towards the pier ignoring my attempts to speak to him . once we reached the pier on got on his small boat and just left . i stood on the pier looking at his fading figure riding the waves of the endless ocean we have . i could nt understand why he just ignored me . i did nt know how to feel . i ran home rushed to my bedroom . i slammed the door and locked it and got in my bed . uncle john taught me how to instantly fall asleep as to be able to change worlds . newline newline when i woke up i was cold . i was always cold here , having no bed or home helped . i got up and ran to the makeshift tarp that cover the entrance to my room . there was sam and tom and kara . newline  hey loser , you finally up from your 3 oclock nap ?  tom said in the most sarcastic voice he could come up with . newline newline  shut up , how about you get some beauty sleep , maybe it ll fix your ugly face  i snapped back . newline newline sam and kara both laughed at this one . i sat down around the fire and started into it s depths . the world here was tough , i had been and orphan since the 3 world war . china and russia had finally decided to go at it over a petty dispute over some trade deals . america being the great nation we were had to butt in and help china since we had outsourced all of jobs to them . things went south from there every nation chose a side and by this point all nuclear warheads had been gotten rid of . the world was in chaos and everyone got hurt . no one was happy , only the super rich lived in homes anymore , or went to school or had jobs . i was unfortunately one of the poor . all of our parents ha died in the bombing and we lived on the run . stealing from stores and making due with what we could get . i was tough , i was the leader of our group and i made sure we made it through every stupid situation we got ourselves into . uncle john told me when you pick a world you die in the other . i thought back to how he lived , carefree and without a worry in the world . i guess he liked it back in big blue since he had no cares , he could do whatever he wanted and not worry . he always called big blue home for some reason . he was always curious why i called it big blue . i never told him it was because this world was home . that world was different , there was no struggle or excitement . no connections to anyone , no one cared about anything and we all just went about our seemingly perfect lives . as i looked around the faces of my family around the fire i realized there was no way i can go to perfect when people needed me here . this was home . newline it s garbage ,  the demiurge said , staring balefully at the rotating world before it . newline newline  garbage !  gasped sophia , raising her arms protectively around her child s work .  it s beautiful !  the seas sparkled with life , white clouds swirled in patterns above the planet s surface . as she brought her eye down low , she could see the grass growing on the plains , the snowcapped mountains , the vast deserts , all of them teeming with the intricate mechanisms of life .  this might be the most beautiful thing you ve ever created .  newline newline  oh , it is ,  the demiurge said , shoving its tools aside .  it s perfect .  the demiurge growled low in its throat .  but you know what s going to happen to it ?  newline newline sophia looked up to her child .  what ?  newline newline  the client s going to populate it !  the demiurge snarled .  with his own creations ! the whole thing  the demiurge raked its claws across the top of the atmosphere , barely staying its hand .  it s a terrarium for the client s pet projects . they re going to live there and feed off its bounty , they re going to reproduce , and use my world as they see fit  argh !  the demiurge threw up its hands .  they re going to ruin it , you know that ? and the worst part of all is , it s part of the plan . it s intended . an entire precious world to be put at their disposal .  newline newline  well ,  sophia said tentatively .  you could always keep this one .  she turned her eye to the collection of completed worlds .  give him another .  newline newline  no , no ,  the demiurge grumbled .  this one s custommade . none of the others would work for supporting his creations .  it sighed .  i knew this when i took the project on . i knew this would happen . i just did nt expect ...  newline newline  then tell him no ,  sophia said . newline newline  what ? no , no , i ca nt   newline newline  tell him no ,  she insisted .  tell him you re keeping this one . tell him you ll make another .  newline newline  no ,  the demiurge sighed .  it d just turn out  that was my inspiration , to tell the truth . the client provided all the specifications . it  ugh , i hate to admit it , but it would nt have turned out half as good without him .  the demiurge stood up and pushed away from its workbench .  that s what s so fucking infuriating about it .  newline newline sophia stood silently , her skirt drifting across the floor as she swayed back and forth on her heels .  you could nt convince him to , say , accept a lesser copy ? you know ? convince him that his creations do nt require this level of craftsmanship , and would be fine  would be better suited , actually , with a cruder version ?  newline newline the demiurge raised an eyebrow .  and how am i supposed to do that ?  newline newline sophia picked up a thin metal shaving from her child s workbench and curled it around her finger , watching it take the shape of a serpent , the sharp tip of its fangs drawing out a drop of blood , as red and tempting as an apple .  oh ,  she said .  i think i have an idea . the sultan had decided that he needed a new rug . newline newline of course this was a momentous occasion that brought all the merchants and traders from the bazaars of sidon and beyond . for not only would the sultan pay a very generous sum for a rug he deemed worthy , but one who found favor with the sultan would see his business grow exceptionally .  fit for the feet of a king !  a merchant could boast , increasing his prices as much as he liked while growing rich on the profits that the royal endorsement would bring . tradesmen from across the land flooded into the entrance of the sultan s palace , setting their best rugs up against walls , across balconies , and sprawled out across the floor . many a suspicious glance and mischievous grin were shared around the room as the merchants prepared for the afternoon s showing , shouting and bartering for the best viewing spots . through the course of a morning , the palace lobby had transformed into a living , breathing bazaar . the smell of freshly cooked kebab and the sound of beautiful music played by hired musicians floated through the air as the sultan and his everpresent advisers strode towards the palace lobby . the sultan moved with a sense of purpose and a focused , somewhat serious expression on his face . newline newline newline in many kingdoms , a king entering a room would be met by total silence out of fear andor respect . this was not the case with the merchants of sidon . at the sight of the sultan , the room exploded into chaos as the hopeful vendors all began to peddle their wares at once . newline newline  great sultan ! see my expertly handcrafted rugs , it took master artisans 10 years to create each of these , thousands of threads !  newline newline  masterful sultan , i know your tastes are excellent enough to appreciate these exotic floor coverings , weaved in interesting patterns from the island of trt !  newline newline  sultan , forgive the insolence of these peasants with their mediocre rugs . they should know a man such as yourself requires only the finest . i have for you rugs taken straight from the mesopotamian royal palace . know what it means to truly walk upon the conquered !  newline newline  sultan ! knotted ! flatweave ! embroidered ! anything you d like , i have it ! great prices !  newline newline the merchants fought to be heard , struggling to push past one another with armfuls of rugs . the sultan patiently eyed each trader and their bundles of textiles . eventually he began taking rugs by hand from the grovelling merchants , and looking them over before throwing them upon the floor in heaps , in the ultimate disgrace . one by one , the disheartened merchants began to move off to the sidelines , waiting until the choice was made to recover their rejected rugs . the sultan cleared through almost the entire room , occasionally pointing rugs out to his watchful advisers , only to have them shake their heads disapprovingly and adding to the growing covering of misplaced rugs that had begun to fill the room . the last merchant stood near the entrance to the palace , at the opposite end of where the sultan had entered . if not for the balcony atop which his rugs sat , it would have been a very poor spot indeed . the sultan spoke : newline newline  why did you choose here , so far from where i would enter ?  newline newline the dark skinned merchant smiled , his teeth white as the sand of the beaches of aben . newline newline  i knew the sultan was wise enough to see every carpet before choosing , and this way you are certain that you have found the right choice , having deemed the other choices inferior .  newline newline the sultan smiled back .  where are you from ?  newline newline the merchant looked off into the distance wistfully .  i am batik , from the ziggurauts of zanzibar  newline newline  well then , batik of zanzibar , show me your wares .  newline newline batik waved to his assistant at the top of the balcony , who quickly unfurled the rugs . the largest one was larger than the balcony was high , the topmost portion was hidden from view as a result . it was a massive beast of a rug , with tiny , intricate details and designs . earthy tones and mesmerizing patterns dominated the rug , creating a masterful lattice of artistic handiwork . the sultan could not hide an expression of pleasure at the sight , and his advisers began to speak . newline newline  sultan , this is much better than the ones we have seen so far  newline newline  it s the perfect size for the antechamber !  newline newline  i think it would be worth the sum he would ask us for .  newline newline the sultan did nt need convincing .  quite the rug , batik of zanzibar . let me see the next one as well .  newline newline with another wave of his hand , the assistants at the top of the balcony heaved the first , large rug out of the way to reveal a smaller , but much more vibrant piece . almost like an eye , a small blue pupil , an orange iris , and ringed by blue once more , this rug really stood out to the sultan . again the advisers began to whisper . newline newline  so vibrant !  newline newline  the colours ...  newline newline  worth every penny , i think .  newline newline again , the sultan was impressed by the quality and design of the rug .  zanzibar has quite the artistry !  said the sultan as the merchants made mental notes to purchase from zanzibar more often . newline newline  what else do you have for me ?  newline newline  just one more rug , sultan .  newline newline  well then , bring it out !  newline newline with another wave of his hand , another rug came unfurling from the balcony . this rug was red and black in colour , with vibrant purple snaking across it , as well as a large image of a pair of copulating humans . the sultan began to laugh , a deep , hearty laugh that soon had the whole room laughing along . newline newline  that s quite the tapestry you ve got there , batik of zanzibar !  newline newline  it s part of a grand collection , this rug has been in the room of many young princes before they tied the knot .  newline newline the sultan smiled a wide smile . newline newline  then it shall be in my son s chamber when he is of age , i ll take all three !  newline newline while the defeat hurt , especially having to pick up and sort all their discarded rugs , the merchants were impressed by the quality of the rugs , and the ability of batik . they waited for him outside the palace after he had been paid . newline newline  where did you find such wonderful rugs ?  asked one newline newline  how much did you get for them ?  inquired another . newline newline batik smiled . newline newline  for the three of them , i received fifteen hundred gold pieces .  newline newline  what ? why so little ? you could have easily asked for twice as much .  newline newline  he offered me twice as much  replied batik as he loaded his camels  but i did not want to curse my luck by being greedy . after all , i am already making another six thousand from this trade .  newline newline the merchants were perplexed .  six thousand ! ? ! ?  they asked ,  how ?  newline newline  well that ties in to how i got the rugs in the first place . after a heated debate on my abilities as a salesman i had bet the prince of zanzibar six thousand gold pieces that i could not sell the rug from his lustful youth bedchamber to the choosiest man in the arabic empire .  batik smiled .  which of course is the sultan of sidon . i slipped it into a truly valuable pair of rugs i bought from the prince s mother .  newline newline  how did you know selling it as a collection would work ?  asked a merchant as batik mounted his camel . batik smiled wickedly . newline newline  i did nt .  newline newline and with that , batik kicked his camel into action , his coin purse heavy and his pride intact . newline newlinei held your hand , i told you my problems , and i loved you . whatever i did , you were there , and i knew that you always were . even when i was in high school . everyone thought it was strange that i would sit alone , smiling , and talking sometimes , just being content alone . but i knew it , you were the one i could always be with . even when the kids shoved me into lockers , and rumors went around causing me to bleed , you made sure to stay by my side . now , at the age of 24 , i think , i am now afraid , for the first time since i was little and lightning struck the tree in our neighborhood . newline newline suddenly , i do nt even know how much time ago , but i can tell recently , you became more solid to me . i could feel you . at first , i was ecstatic , but now , i am unsure . when i went to drive to uni last week , i could nt even open the door , yet you could . you drove me , but when i got to class , i was almost sat on , until you allowed me to sit on your lap and listen to the philosophy lecture . boring , right ? but that s what i get for going into this major . newline newline later on , i went to eat something , purely out of boredom really , and i did nt even feel the slight bit hungry , because you had just ate . slowly , reality was dawning on me , and still is . i m the imaginary friend , and you are my mindscape .december 21st : newline newline humanity had spent years preparing for this moment . i watched from within the massive floating airship as flames ravaged the lands . god promised to never again destroy the world with water . apparently fire was still free game . newline newline three years before the superflare , every one of the world s governments united to create project a.r.k . the engineering is complex , but the project involved creating a series of aerial sanctuaries to save as many humans as possible . newline newline i walked along the deck of the largest of them , the  noah .  the exterior of the  arc   as the ships were called by the public  was made of some material that insulated heat , keeping the interior safe from the raging heat outside . the wiring of the controls was somehow advanced enough to survive the barrage of xrays that it was getting . newline newline most of the other passengers are looking at what used to be their homes through the viewport . besides one guy who is laughing , all are silent , sorrowful , with the shadows from the giant flames playing across their faces . their are about 5,000 of us on this ship . there are many more than that burning on the ground . newline newline april 21st : newline newline it s strange to think it s spring without there being green things growing on the ground . it is still barren from the trial  the religious folk started calling it that , and it caught on  . i saw a little girl with a flower pin in her hair the other day , and i almost cried . i suppose that life grows nevertheless . newline newline june 21st : newline newline inside , most people seem to be getting along fine to life in the air . i tried parasailing from the exterior  a fairly common activity  , but the record heat chased me back . i suppose that i ll stick to the swimming pool . newline newline september 21st : newline newline flu season . no one knows how the bug got in . there is plenty of medicine , but being sick is still miserable in such a contained space . it s spreading quickly and universally . the sounds of illness echo through the halls . it is difficult to sleep and eat . newline newline i guess the bigger the ark the harder the fall . you would stand against us , brother ?  newline newline i shrugged ,  what can i say ? i ve always had a soft spot for the underdog .  newline newline pestilence looked furious ,  you would deny your divine duty , the one given to us by our father , fight to protect the humans and stop the end time ?  newline newline i smiled ,  so i take it you re not planning joining me ?  newline newline pestilence opened his mouth to speak but was silenced by a wave from the pale rider . his hollow eyes stared at me , unblinking and unwavering .  you know this is futile . the end time was decreed to happen now , and nothing you can do will stop it .  newline newline i stared up to look at the sun , it was nt shining as brightly since the apocalypse started .  it just is nt right .  newline newline  it is not your place to determine what is right . we follow the will of our father , we do not question it .  newline newline  fuck him  , i retorted . newline newline famine looked shocked at my pronouncement , pestilence livid . however , death still retained his calm demeanor .  excuse me ?  newline newline  fuck him , fuck you , and you , and you .  newline newline  stop acting like a child , war .  newline newline  i m acting like a child ? what about you ? you re following orders without even thinking about what you re doing because , dad said so   , i attempted to mimic pestilence s voice when i said the last part . i did nt think i did it very well but it still had the desired effect of further infuriating him .  personally , i think that i m the only one here acting like an adult . hell , i m probably the only one out of us four who s ever made a conscious fucking decision in our entire existence . why even care about dad s will ? it s not like he does anything anymore , i ve seen coma patients do more in a week than dad has done in the past billion years but still you insist that we stick to the written plan . fuck that , plans change , and if they do nt , then it was a shitty plan from the get go . so fuck the plan , i m putting an end to it right here .  newline newline pestilence was sputtering something unintelligible , famine s jaw hung open . death replied ,  arrogant as you are , you do not have power to stop us .  newline newline  alone ? no , but i did ask for help .  i started to smile . newline newline  and who would help you ?  newline newline as death said this , a meteor struck the ground nearby . the four of us turned to look at the site , and nothing happened . however , the sound of a chicken clucking caused us to all turn again once more to see a fifth man who had appeared from out of nowhere . he was elegantly dressed , though his clothes were always in flux . he was laughing as he said ,  i was waiting forever for someone to say that , and hey guys , long time , no see !  chaos always did have a flair for the dramatic . newline newline death turned back to me as he said ,  really ? you know i hate that guy . he s so fucking annoying .  newline newline newline newline newline newlineit s beginning to look a lot like black mass newline newline all around the ring , newline newline take a look in bloody glass , the sacrificial ass newline

. they don  t do anything . they  re polarized and smoked and they don  t do anything to uv rays , they just block them , somehow . i  m trying to stare at the sun , but it  s still too bright . newline newline i open the book to my bookmark ,  jeffty is five ,  but i can  t see anything for a minute because of the sun staring . i really hate harlan ellison . he  s an old man and a hack and an arrogant prick . but there  s this girl on the bus who likes him , so now i have to read this crap . science fiction is for idiots . newline newline and unfortunately for me , some idiots have very large boobs . newline newline it feels like i  ve been out here for hours , days . chitter chatter on the radio about magnetic pulses from the sun . blither blather about america getting hotter while china starts to freeze . but i  m not a fool , i know that radios don  t work when magnetic pulses screw up the earth , and this radio , it was made in china , probably . just another buttload of fiction . give me a break . newline newline no , seriously , give me a break . if the earth  s stopped spinning , then i  m going to be fifteen for a very long time , and that is not acceptable .john , 59 , was watching the news on his brand new wall television . a young woman passes by and somehow he felt closer to her than the 30 years of mariage with his wife , marianne . suddenly , a gunman appears on the scene . normally , the news station would cut the feed if something like that would happen . the camera points at the young woman . she gets shot at and falls onto the ground . john felt very uneasy at the same moment like his heart stopped . he then realizes that marianne was never his own soulmate . he closes his eyes . john sighs and his vitality becomes disminished by the seconds until he stopped breathing .the creek flooded the walking path today . i take the path to get to school . usually , the creek barely covers its bed . but sometimes it overflows . it makes sense when there s a rainstorm . but sometimes rainstorms do nt cause the creek to flood at all , or the creek inexplicably floods during dry spells . there has nt been any rain for the last month , but the creek flooded the path today anyways . newline newline i sloughed through the flooded section of the path , and continued to school . i passed by the cotton fields . well , they were cotton today , and tomatoes the year before that . a plane flew over the fields with a fine mist in its wake . sprinklers jettisoned spurts of water over the plants , but i was at a safe distance a dry distance . newline newline by the time that school was out , the creek had receded . my socks had dried by that time , so i was glad that they were nt going to get soaked again . the stream had left the usual jetsam on the path : a muddy streak outlined a scattered mess of twigs and sodden leaves . but i was shocked to discover an oversized fish splashing about in one of the leftover puddles . newline newline the fish was about a meter long , and it was flopping around on its side . i could nt understand how such a large fish could muster so much energy as it splashed in a puddle that barely covered its tail fin . i thought that it might die if it was left in its shallow , muddy puddle . so i tried to pick it up . newline newline  magikarp karp . magikarp karp ,  said the fish . guess we got ta ditch flight ,  he sighed .  probably have to chuck telekinesis out the door , too .  newline newline he stared out the porthole at the field of stars beyond . newline newline  they re

their society will never make it off the ground .  newline newline he looked down at the blueprints , years of work on a flight mechanism that would now go to waste .  goddamn budgetcutters ,  he

fel turned to look at her , still smiling , with eyes bright in anticipation . fel grabbed her bass , sat on her amp and looked up at her . newline newline  you ready ?  fel asked . newline newline i think i finally am .  she nodded .i awoke in the hospital with a sudden jolt , like i had a nightmare and it overpowered me . a bandage was wrapped around my left shoulder , and my head was on fire , but the pain vanished when i noticed the man standing in the corner of my room . newline newline he wore a black suit that matched his gelled , black hair . he was handsome , but he was a stranger . newline newline  who are you ?  i asked , glancing towards the door . newline newline  and good morning to you , too , marin .  he bowed his head as though i were royalty and took a step forward .  my name is lucifer .  newline newline i laughed aloud and nodded sarcastically .  right . lem me guess , you own a night club in l.a. , you re not so secretly in love with a cold detective , and you hate children ?  newline newline he genuinely looked concerned , most likely for my mental health , and he shook off the comment . something shiny glistened in his suit s pocket , causing me to cringe away from him instinctively . i had already been hurt once . newline newline but he held up his hands .  relax , marin , i m not the one who hurt you , nor am i here to hurt you . i want to chat .  newline newline  chat ?  newline newline he smiled and flashed a set of perfectly straight , bleachedwhite teeth that you normally only see in magazines after some heavy photoshopping . though , the way that he carried himself was nt in a prissy , business kind of way . sure , he sounded arrogant , but he also sounded ... divine ? newline newline  i am here to tell you that you were dead . the ... man that kidnapped you shot you pointblank in the heart .  he explained , twiddling something in between his fingers . newline newline my hand came to rest over my chest , but i felt nothing , and i began to question his sanity and whether or not i should prepare myself to run . triggered by my movement , he started pacing around the room . newline newline  i saved you , though , and smote that hellbound man until there was nothing left .  he laughed at his own statement and glanced over at me , like he was expecting me to laugh along with him . newline newline my mind was a million different places , but not here . this man was obviously insane , taking the name of the devil , claiming he healed me , and then confessing to murder . i weighed my odds of escaping a man that was probably twice my size . they were nt very good . newline newline the man stopped in front of the door , and slowly , he flipped the lock before turning to face me . fear engulfing my actions , i tried to swing off the bed , but he raised his hand and an invisible force held me in place . i sat , stunned and afraid , while he looked me up and down . newline newline  i m here to protect you , marin , that s all . you re young , so my buzzer has nt gone off in quite a while , but when it did , i ran as fast as i could .  he explained it as though it was all supposed to click , and i would understand . newline newline methodically , he stepped over to me and whispered ,  i ll prove it to you .  and he placed his hand over my shoulder . newline newline i wanted to scream , and i almost did , but a warm , white light flitted through any open space it could find in his hand , and an unexplainable energy flowed through me . when he pulled his hand away , i let out the breath i did nt know i was holding as i relished in the fact that i was nt dead . but the bandage on my shoulder was gone , exposing perfectly healthy skin . newline newline  how did you ...  i trailed off , as the impossible became possible . newline newline lucifer smiled and tossed what he was holding into the air .  see ? i guess you could call me your guardian angel . now , i hate to leave so soon , but i am a busy man . so if you ever need anything , marin , shoot me a prayer .  newline newline the thing he was playing with landed on the bed . it was a shiny , silver coin , about the size of a halfdollar , but instead of a face , there was a pentagram carved into it . i glared at him as the memories of what happened came flooding back , and he clicked his tongue . newline newline  whoops , sorry , bad word choice .  he said , and when i blinked , he was gone .the devil stood before me . as per standard , thick , black smoked billowed around him like a cloak . like his horns , it was the colour of midnight . newline newline  i do nt remember summoning you .  i said , pressing the mute button on my tv remote . newline newline  you did nt . i am here of my own accord .  he responded , his voice seeming to come from every corner of the room at once .  i need to know how you have so many souls .  newline newline  i dunno . found em .  i shrugged . newline newline  just yesterday , you traded a mortal soul into eternal damnation and torment for a sandwich . just a regular sandwich . it was nt even the first time you ve done that .  he said , brow creasing . newline newline  so you want to know where i keep finding souls ?  newline newline  yes . i ll trade back every mortal soul you ve ever given me . just tell me where they come from .  newline newline i scoffed .  with the amount of souls i have ? you keep them . it s small change at this point .  newline newline the devil s confusion increased tenfold .  you consider a total of one hundred thousand , two hundred and thirty three souls to be small change ?  newline newline i shrugged .  basically .  newline newline anger flashed onto his ugly face .  where do the souls come from ?  newline newline i sighed , and cleared my throat .  well , you see , mister stan ...  newline newline  satan .  he corrected , angered further by my apparent inability to remember the name of the father of all lies . newline newline  that s what i said . anyway , when a mummy soul and a daddy soul love each other very much , they have a baby soul . any questions ?  newline newline  i tire of your jokes , mortal .  he growled , completely unaware that i was nt kidding . newline newline souls are power . of course , when you have more souls than the devil himself , that gives you some capacity to surprise him . i knew that his revenge would be terrible if he actually worked out how to breed souls , so i snapped my fingers . newline newline the smoke around the devil began to dissipate . newline newline  ... what are you doing ?  he asked .  ... how are you doing ...  newline newline and he vanished . that ought to keep him away for at least a week . i was already thinking of new ways to mock the god of the underworld as i unmuted my tv to watch another episode of my favorite sitcom .it was nt the generals who claimed him . it was nt ever the sorcerers who hunted him down . it was the healer . as the broken winners waded through corpses and fallen arrows to dig out their survivors , everyone gave him a wide berth . he had fallen during the battle , struck by a projectile , his horse throwing him for the sake of its own survival and now he lay in the clearing . newline newline there were many who would have slit his throat to ensure the deed was done . to make his demise as final as their departed comrades . no one would have batted an eye or fought with feelings of mercy . their hearts were too poisoned by the sick of war , hating him for causing it , hating him for continuing it . and yet no one had done it . they had left him , lying in a paradox . dead and alive , untouched and waiting for the one man who had earned the right to know . newline newline martin tread solidly towards the breathing corpse . he did nt flinch as his boots snapped twigs and arrow shafts alike . his ankles did nt roll as the enemy s limbs lined his path . he had one goal , and one goal only . newline newline martin crouched by his side . he was still breathing . newline newline  i need a healer ,  the man gasped . martin knew by the abnormal crackle in the man s voice , that he had a punctured lung . not lethal . not yet . newline newline  you re in luck .  martin commented .  i am one .  newline newline he had thought long and hard about this . here he was , martin s enemy , lying in the muck dying an ordinary man . martin s vendetta had changed over the years , from revenge to revolution , from personal to national , but the reason had stayed the same . this man was the root of martin s fury . newline newline  please ,  the man coughed . one hand flew to his side , bracing his ribcage . the other clung to martin s tattered scarf .  you must help me .  newline newline martin had thought about it more than once . mercy could be as terrible as death . but no , that was not the fate for this man lying before him . newline newline  i will ,  martin promised . he squinted his eyes against the watery autumn light . the air smelled like smoke as his compatriots created funeral pyres . his ears were awash with the sound of silence . newline newline  did you know ,  martin asked finally , watching as scavenger birds circled the thermals above the plain ,  why i became a healer ?  newline newline he ignored the fluttering efforts of the man s hand against his leg . newline newline  i wanted to help people . i wanted to save the ones you broke , fix the ones you discarded .  he looked down , shoving the hand off his knee .  that s what i tell people . they believe me . what wonderful work , so fulfilling and worthwhile .  newline newline martin snorted . newline newline  some of them have guessed . the generals ? the sorcerers ? they know the truth . they saw it as soon as they met me .  he smiled bitterly , mouth turned down at the corners ,  i ll tell you the truth too .  newline newline  a healer knows the body . better than anyone really . we can identify the tiniest of problems , and rectify it . this means years of work . studying , working , concentrating on tiny veins as the world literally crumbles around us , just to save a patient .  newline newline  i am the best ,  he continued softly , his voice no louder than a breeze through the air .  you wo nt find a man alive who has nt heard of me and my abilities .  newline newline  hurry up then ,  the man croaked , his voice small and commanding . martin looked him in the face . newline newline  it s hard to become the best . you have to sacrifice so many people along the way . so many lives that could nt be saved . and you remember , every single face .  newline newline  so many faces frozen in agony now . all because of one man . it s not going to kill you by the way , your wound i mean .  martin nodded at the man s side . all four limbs were slowly retreating back to curl around the pain as the man s chest heaved in effort . newline newline  but you know why i became a healer ?  martin asked again . the man stayed silent . newline newline  because a healer knows pain better than anyone else . you wo nt die from your rib .  martin shook his head sorrowfully .  no , you re going to die , because i killed you.slowly , painfully , one cell at a time . until you re nothing more than a rotten carcass . you want to know why ?  newline newline the silence pounded in martin s ears , in beat with his heart and that of the man before him . newline newline  because a healer remembers gerald . and as much as you used to be , you are now a blight on this world . a cancer of men . and as a healer , i must save the nation from you .  newline newline martin stood and beckoned to the footmen waiting to the side . as they loaded the fallen man onto a shabby makeshift stretcher , martin watched , his mind silent .the sensation of cold metal ran up my spine and my eyes snapped open . i sat up quickly and sucked in deep gasp of air . my chest rose and fell quickly and then i felt a slight twinge of pain . looking down i saw black pattern making its way up and down my torso . i reached to feel it and drew my hand back quickly . the area was slightly red and tender , but without a doubt i knew what they were . that familiar feeling of thread . at some point and time i d gotten stitches . newline newline  what the fuck ,  i mumbled . newline newline i looked up and glanced about the room . it was cold and had an odd smell . somewhere between a hospital room and chemicals i could nt quite place . i looked back down to see that i was sitting up high on a metal table . a white sheet covered my waist down . i was naked and in an unfamiliar place . i d be lying if i said this was the first time this had happened , but i usually woke up in bedrooms or living rooms . usually the wake up was abrupt and followed by a hungover walk to a diner for breakfast . newline newline as my head began to clear and i began gathering my thoughts , it occurred to me i had nt gone out the night before . i turned around slowly and it clicked as to where i was . behind me were rows and columns of what resembled large filing cabinets . on the cabinets were names and the stamp t.o.d  below them . i was in a morgue . i turned back to sit forward , careful not to tear my stitches ... stitches ? a new wave of panic washed over me . why did i have stitches ? why did i have them in a morgue of all places ? i began scanning the rest of my body but found no other marks . newline newline  hello ,  i tried to shout but my throat was to dry ,  is there anyone in here ?  newline newline silence . i called out again but was only met with the brief echo of my own voice . i sunk my face into my hands . newline newline  what the hell is happening ?  newline newline i looked back up and of to my right to see a brown envelope on the other table next to me . i brought my legs off to the side slowly and grabbed the sheet . i started to try and stand up but instead stumbled forward like a newborn calf . i raised up my hand to catch myself on the table . on the envelope a large red stamp with bold letters that read confidential  ran across the back . as i steadied myself on my shaky legs i used a free hand to slide the envelope towards myself and turned it over . on the upper tab of the envelope , just above the metal pins that kept it closed , was a small note written in pen that read please open upon awaking  . newline newline as instructed i opened the envelope and emptied the contents onto the table . in it was a smaller white envelope addressed to riley ward , a black flip phone , and a small roll of money held together by a rubber band . the money was mostly  100 bills but there were some twenties in there as well . the roll came out to be a little over 10 grand . when i inspected the black phone i found that there was nothing particularly special about it . i turned it on and looked through it , but there were no numbers , no call history , so all i could gather was that it was new . there was also no reception here so any attempts to make a call would be useless until i got out . newline newline then came the white envelope . my name written across in black pen . my legs had begun to regain feeling but unfortunately so had my stitches . a dull aching pain that began at my midsection and radiated all over my body . it was bearable but not easily ignored . i tore open the envelope and then hoisted myself back up onto the table to sit down . i pulled out the paper from inside and unfolded it . newline newline mr. ward , newline if you are reading this it means that you have likely just woken up . you probably have a lot of questions and are likely scarred . perhaps you are angry or confused . this does not matter . what you need to understand is that time is of the essence and you have been contracted to complete a task for our organization . who we are and why you in particular were chosen is of very little importance . what is important is that you are currently carrying something that means a great deal to our organization . you may have noticed a long series of stitches across your midsection . take comfort in knowing that we took the utmost care in preparing you for this mission , and that the procedure you underwent was performed by highly skilled medical professionals . after completion of this letter we would ask that you go to the cadaver door marked no.12 and open it . inside you will find a new set of clothes , a wallet , a passport , and three prescription bottles . you are to take these things and the phone you ve been given and proceed outside . once you are there wait for a call and you will be given further instructions . we would also discourage any contact with authority figures as we can not guarantee the safety of you or your family if you should choose to do so . please do not test us as we are not patient people . we hope you find the clothing to your liking and you are welcome to use the money you ve been given as you see fit . upon completion of this letter you are to burn it and proceed with your orders . do not fail us , mr.ward . newline newline p.s . please get the lights as you leave . best of luck . newline newline my hands had begun to shake as i was reading . cargo ? mission ? what kind of xfiles bullshit was this . this whole scenario did nt seem real and yet here i was . alone . newline newline i set down the letter and hobbled over to cabinet 12 . sure enough inside was not a dead body but the contents the letter had described . a new clean t shirt and a black hoodie , a pair of blue jeans and a pair of black canvas shoes , a baseball cap with a now defunct team as a logo . the pill bottles were an antibiotic to help prevent infection , a pain killer , and the last one had a label but no print . inside where a couple of white pills . the wallet and passport both had my face but the name read carl marsh eubanks  . fake documents ? what did they want him to do ? newline newline whoever they  were had neglected to give me underwear so it looked like i was going commando . i winced as i bent over slightly to pull up the jeans . i raised my arms slowly and pulled the tshirt on . then the hoodie followed by slipping on the shoes . they  had nt given me socks either . as i put the passport into the pocket of the hoodie and the wallet into my back pocket , i caught a glimpse of something else near the back of the drawer . i pulled the drawer out a little more and stopped when my eyes landed on it . newline newline a black handgun and two clips had been duct taped down on the silver slab . i swallowed hard and reached for it slowly . peeling the tape up and off the gun then holding it in my hand . i had nt gone shooting since i d been in high school . even then all i d ever shot were paper targets with my dad . the situation began to feel even more dangerous . something i did nt even think possible . i checked the safety and stuck the gun between my waist and the band of my jeans . the clips into either of the deep pockets of the jeans . i closed the drawer and took one last look around . my eyes landed on a set of large swinging doors . i made my way towards them and started out but stopped abruptly . a part of me wanted to leave the lights on . maybe in some sort of halfassed rebellion so that i could pretend to have some kind of control in this crazy scenario . but instead i just ran my hand across the switches and flipped the lights off . the room fell dark and i pushed open the doors to leave . newline newline to be continueddear sir , newline newline i call you sir but it s a courtesy you do not deserve . i d name you many vulgar titles but your vile acts will not reduce me to speech better suited to the low and foul likes of yourself . if i knew your name i would not use it . you do not deserve to be elevated to that strata of humanity , for your actions betray your inhuman and wretched nature . newline newline newline do not deny my accusations ! i saw your treachery with mine own eyes . you are guilty , sir , and there is no recourse . you will pay . i will see to it myself . newline newline yes , you may think you re safe , hidden as you are in the swath of anonymity . you may think yourself untouchable , too well placed amongst us respectable human beings to receive the brutal justice you deserve . i hope you feel that way . it is my sincere wish that you sleep soundly tonight , so that when the day comes that i visit down upon you my wrath it is all the more frightening for you . newline newline that wrath will be your undoing , that is my promise . i will show you the meaning of anguish and crush every joy you hold . pain will be your only sustenance , so you d do well to learn to love the taste of it . newline newline sir . you may now wonder about what act in particular i refer to . surely you have a long list of disgusting , deplorable deeds for which you might receive a similar letter . the transgression of which i speak is surely your most sinister . newline newline you , you scoundrel , you beast ! you saw the man before you display truly selfless charity when he left several pennies in the tray for their taking and leaving . you saw as i did how he lost in that dispensation a dime , that piece snuck from his grasp between the outpouring of his goodwill . and you did snatch it up eagerly at his departure ! you treacherous cretin . newline newline cozy yourself in that wretched den in which you reside , amidst cockroaches and vipers . i am on my way , with justice and retribution following behind me . newline newline sincerely , newline udrivethru i  ll give you some time to think about this , alone.  the employer said , as he walked out of the room closing the door behind him . i sat at the table with many thoughts running through my head . this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and all i had to do was sign the contract . newline newline  we can make this decision quick.  the devil said , making himself visible on my right shoulder .  sign the contract . isn  t this what you  ve always wanted ?  newline newline i began to think of all the opportunities that would open up for me . newline newline  yes !  i shouted .  i  d be able to finally put my work out there for the world to see !  newline newline the devil began to laugh .  yes , yes . now , tell the employer you  re ready to sign.  newline newline  what good would this be ?  the angel said , as she too made herself visible but on my left shoulder .  what would you really get in exchange ?  newline newline the angel also had a good point . i mean , the contract was mediocre . the job also required so much out of me . not to mention i would no longer be able to share the last days with my mother who had become very ill with little chance of survival . newline newline  guys , i don  t know what to do !  i began to talk fast . anxiety had begun to set in .  i can  t just leave my mother now . oh but the money i can make so much and i   newline newline  sorry i took so long.  abruptly , i stopped talking as the employer emerged from the opening door . the angel and the devil became invisible . it was now time to make that decision . but you must , once a champion has been called to by a weapon , there is no choice in the matter . you are the latest in a long line of champions to defend us  newline newline i looked down from the angel and focused across the grand hall . lining the corridors were grand portraits of equally grand men with rough beards . they wielded axes , bows , and rifles as they stared down marauding hordes of faceless enemies . newline newline  listen , i m all for tradition and all ... but i do nt think that s right  newline newline  is it not calling out to you ?  newline newline  do nt get me wrong , it definitely is . i just thought that when you said i had been chosen by an ancient weapon to fulfill some grand prophecy , it d be something like that  newline newline i gestured at a case holding a mighty sword with a jewel crusted hilt . newline newline  excalibur has served its purpose in history , and so too will your weapon with you .  newline newline  i just think that i would look pretty stupid waving that around . people would think i m a lunatic trying to fix a global catastrophe with that thing . i mean look at it , what the hell am i supposed to do with that ?  newline newline  mortal , you must understand that your people s perceptions of these artifacts held no weight when they were forged long ago . and may i remind you that each weapon only calls its champion in times of dire need . every second you waste may doom us all  newline newline i relented and picked up the dusty baby rattle newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinethe plan is simple . newline newline first , we ll need a car . newline newline cam , you re going to drive , i need you to head down 95 and hit exit 14 as fast as you can . we ll need everyone alive for this , so paul , you re going to make sure that thing is bulletproof . the good news , once the ride is over , you can call it day cam . the bad ? you re taking us through a brick wall . we re hitting the wall of the pool hall on 3rd as hard as we possibly can , this time of day it should be pretty empty , but we need our boys on the inside to guarantee that . newline newline once we re in , we scatter . you need to move quick and clean , i want every civilian tied up and blindfolded before they know what s going on . put them in the back office and head for the stairs . newline newline in the basement there should be an old access shaft , according to the blueprints dj got us , the tunnels underneath all lead to the same place , the public library . newline newline this is where we can relax , take your time getting upstairs , blend . there s an unlocked door leading up to the roof , we get there , and bob is going to have our lift ready to the next roof over , right bob ? as you may know , that s the new bencroft building , which lucky for us , is still under construction . newline newline head to the other side , get on that railing , and boys  i m afraid we ll have to jump . there should be a garden on the 18th floor , if our math is right , you ll land just fine . you ll go through the french doors , if they re locked , go through em anyway . sam has been sitting on the place for weeks , so it should be empty if we time it right . newline

www.youtube.comwatch ? vqybufny7y8w  would be a fun inspirationa short history of levanistan : newline newline the earliest appearance of levanistan was during the dissolution of the ottoman empire . originally , divided between the french and british protectorates and the emerging middle eastern nations . the levantines were an ignored cultural group in this process . newline newline most territory culturally belonging to the levantines was absorbed by the british protectorates . legally , turkey and french syria controlled most land belonging to the levantines . newline newline most cries for a national levantine homeland were ignored , in favor of the emerging state of israel . though a large percentage of levantines were jewish , few cared for a state defined by religion . newline newline roughly , during the 1940 s a levantine nationalism emerged . though out shined by the emerging islamism movements in the middle east , it was the under current of what would happen next . newline newline the emerging battle of east and west would contain a big push for the levantine movement . the levantines were one of the few prowest groups in the middle east . with isreal , they were one of the few allies the west had in such a volatile region . with the growing pressure of communist rebellions in the middle east , the west took action . newline newline along with isreal , many western nations began to supply the levantines with arms and munitions . the rebel group levantine lords and rebels  llr  made their first play during the sixday war . once again overshadowed by isreal , but the levantines made a few decisive plays in the war . confusing invading squadrons , and wrecking supply lines , the llr was one of the reason s the war was so untenable for the arab forces . newline newline the llr was active in many more of the isrealarab wars , but did not succeed in making any progress on creating a levanistan . the llr dropped out of favor with isreal after the start of israelipalestinian conflict . the llr declared it  a fruitless effort , on both fronts .  newline newline while levantine nationalism continued , it was not as fierce . it began to shift from revolution , to politics . newline newline one important politician was  joseph isbeck  often called the grandfather of modern levanistan . isbeck was famous for securing rights , and protection , for the predominantly jewish cultural group . isbeck was successful in creating a pseudolevanistan nation . more of a self governing province then an actual nation , but it was an early success in nationalist levantine politics . newline newline the modern levantine came about during the gulf war . the llr agreed to help the u.s.a , and allies , invade iraq . in return the u.s.a would grant them a levantine nation . this agreement was more of a compromise between turkey , syria , and iran over a territorial grey zone . newline newline the llr was extremely effective in the war . using its common tactic of rush , and destroy , the llr was terribly effective at destroying outposts . these early attacks would allow the u.s.a , and allies to push inwards . newline newline this was not without controversy . most middle eastern nations accused the u.s.a of returning to western imperialism . most even threatened to deem the new levanistan a terrorist nation . but , because of strategic importance , iran declared it would defend levanistan in any conflict . turkey claimed the u.s.a was just in the creation of levanistan . newline newline though , this has led to much political confusion . the still emerging state is still considered part of iraq , or turkey . this has led the united nations to quiet a snag . the nations is often a cross roads of civil war , between different factions in the middle east . meaning it is more then not controlled by foreign rebels . newline newline this has led to the levanistan question :  how long must a nation exist to control it s self for ?  even with the help of turkey , and iran , the nation is still embroiled in other nations problems . newline newline these strange factors have led to the long asked question :  what exactly are levanistan s borders ?  nobody is quite sure ... newline newline newlinewill neared the room , begging his hands to stop shaking around the clipboard . he had done so much to finally get this job . there was no backing out just because of some stupid nerves . he saw one of the senior doctors walk out from the elevator , eyes on her own clipboard . feeling queasy and out of breath , will ducked into a different room : the supply closet . newline newline pussy . that  s what he was . now he was deeper in trouble ! newline newline he took the surgical mask off and let himself breathe for a bit . god . he put his face in his hands and let himself have a moment of warm darkness . newline newline the door opened and closed quickly . newline newline fuck . fuck . fuck . if anyone knew he was hiding here god , what a mess on his first day . newline newline he could hear someone else  s harsh , ragged breath . newline newline  fuck !  the other person exclaimed , breathing harder .  jesus ,  he wheezed .  sorry , you gave me quite a scare there , doctor , with your face hidden like   he stopped and lowered his voice to a whisper .  didn  t even know anyone was in here.  newline newline will kept silent . would it seem weird if he went out of the room with his face in his hands ? why the fuck had he taken the mask off ? if the man went to report him to a superior ... newline newline  say , doctor , are you ok ?  newline newline shit , he was already weird .  yup ,  he muttered behind his hands .  i  m just i  m just tired.  newline newline  oh , sorry . am i interrupting your naptime ? i  ll be out soon . i mean , i  m not even supposed to be out of bed , much less in this closet , but doctor , it  s my mother . god , is she a nag ! she  s probably overjoyed that i  m confined in this hospital and can  t escape her for the first time in thirty years . going on about , if you hadn  t done this , this , and this when you were young , then you would be perfectly healthy like your uncle jim ! i mean , come on ! newline newline  sorry , doc . i  ll keep quiet . but can you really nap like that ? looks awfully uncomfortable.  newline newline  i  m fine ,  will gritted out . newline newline  yeah , ok , then . sorry.  newline newline will  s heartbeat quickened again as a thought entered his head .  you should probably go back . your mom is probably looking for you . and the nurses.  the nurses , for sure , wouldn  t let him be . newline newline  i will , i will . just give me a moment , doc . but hey , don  t they have actual beds at this hospital you can sleep on ? i saw it on   newline newline the door opened again . newline newline  oh . i didn  t know anyone was  all right ,  the newcomer said , and will heard the door whooshing to be closed again . newline newline but then he heard the smack of its closing being stopped and ,  hey , wait a minute , guy . jesus , are you crying ? look , come here .  newline newline the door closed and two new pair of feet shuffled in , much to will  s irritation . the guy had been about to leave ! why the fuck did motormouth mcgee over here intervene ? newline newline  i  m not crying ,  the guy said , his wobbly voice forecasting some major waterworks .  i  ve got allergies.  then he forced a strange cackle before breaking down and weeping uncontrollably . newline newline  there there ,  motormouth said as he presumably either thumped him in the back or punched him repeatedly in the stomach . will hoped it was the latter .  what is it buddy ? i was a wreck , too , when i first got my diagnosis.  newline newline  it  s my wife  newline newline more thumping went on , and motormouth said ,  let it all out , buddy . let it all out . life  s the pits.  newline newline  i just didn  t want to cry in front of her  newline newline  yeah , i know that feeling . do i know it well took me all i had to hold it in front of her.  newline newline  it  s just how could i be so stupid ? i thought everything was going so well in life . i got flowers and a reservation because it  s our anniversary and   another harsh sob , and will could smell the flowers he was talking about , too . they stunk up the whole room .  and then she yells at me for coming to her workplace and not knowing she was allergic to flowers . how was i to know ?  newline newline  oh for fuck  s sake ,  motormouth said .  you  re crying because your wife yelled at you ? son , i got like , three months to live . and how the fuck did you not know your wife is allergic to flowers ? did you never give her any during the entire time you were dating ?  newline newline new guy wailed .  it  s not my fault ! i met her in real life a week ago for our wedding ! she didn  t say anything about my eflowers ...  newline newline  you said it was your anniversary ,  will said , and the groaned inwardly for speaking up . newline newline  yeah , our week anniversary . it was  wait , who are you ?  newline newline  the good doctor here is taking a nap ,  motormouth said .  don  t disturb him.  newline newline  god , you must know danielle then . please don  t tell danielle that i cried . i know she hates betas . she used to date one and then   newline newline the door opened and closed again . footsteps came in . will let out a frustrated noise . were there no other closets in this hospital or did will have the worst luck ? newline newline  what the fuck ? who the fuck are all of you ?  newline newline  hey , buddy , there  s no need to curse ,  motormouth said .  and i  m just about at the

needle . talking about taking my blood sample . like fuck , get out of here with that shit . i told my mom i ain  t sick.  newline newline  don  t talk about your mother that way ,  motormouth said aggressively . newline newline  what , you don  t know her.  newline newline  was this female with the needle , was her name danielle ?  the pathetic loser asked from the corner . newline newline  the fuck i know . just shut up , will all of ya.  newline newline the lights went off , the kid presumably having finally found the light switch . hallelujah , will thought . the one good thing that happened in the last twenty minutes . newline newline  hey , turn that back on , kid !  motormouth yelled . newline newline  why ? y  all in here to hide , right ? or am i interrupting some gay ass orgy ?  newline newline  watch your mouth ! i have a   newline newline  that  s what i thought . now , really . peeps must be looking for y  all , too . so best shut up . one can hide but four ? now that  s hard mode.  newline newline motormouth finally decided that it was in his best interests to shut up . will couldn  t believe that it was the kid who convinced him . or maybe the kid had duct taped his mouth , who knows . newline newline  ok , but was the nurse named danielle ?  newline newline  for fuck  s sake !  motormouth and will yelled . newline newline it was that moment will heard the door open . newline newline  kyle , there you are . your mom has been looking all over for you . she already told me you  re afraid of needles . it  s ok , a lot of people are.  newline newline  what ?  kyle said .  i  m not afraid of no needle ! mooommmm !  newline newline  danielle ?  loser squeaked . newline newline  rob ? what are you doing here ? i told you to go home ! and you  re still

go already !  the squeak of feet and   kyle ! wait ! achoo !  and will heard danielle dash after him . newline newline  i might as well hang myself now ,  loser said . newline newline  well , no better place than the closet , buddy.  motormouth gave loser a hearty slap . will heard him leave , but not before stopping to say ,  have a nice day , doc . better go before this sonofabitch offs himself . hope this bonding experience means you  ll sneak me real food sometimes.  newline newline and now , loser and him were the only one left . at this rate , loser would really hang himself in the closet and that  d be a real mess . newline newline  look ,  will said ,  why don  t you throw the flowers out and go make her dinner ? she seemed real excited about it.  newline newline  really ?  loser said , perking up . newline newline no , you poor , poor sap , thought will , but his voice said ,  yup.  newline newline  i hope so . i even stalked her pinterest page for her favorite recipes.  newline newline  sounds fantastic.  newline newline  ok ! i  d hug you but i heard that creeped people out   newline newline  yup.  newline newline  ok , bye.  newline newline loser closed the door after him , and will slowly removed his hands from his face and put the mask back on . good . it looked like nobody else was ninjaing it in the room . he shook his head . god , what a day . newline newline he cracked the door open a bit and tried to hear and see if anyone was heading that way . the hallway was silent . newline newline will left the closet and went into room 741 like he was supposed to thirty or so minutes ago . there were no other doctors or patients there , just mr. donovan , waiting for him . of course , he wasn  t actually waiting . mr. donovan had been in a coma for the last week and probably didn  t know anything that was going around him . if he had , he surely would have called for help as will turned off the ventilator .walking through the forest , i lost my footing as the mountain gave way to a landslide . carrying me down i lost consciousness quickly when i struck my head . i am not sure how much time had passed , it was dark when i had awoke . i was lucky and was able to free myself from the bit of land that had tried to swallow me but had choked on my legs . standing i noticed i was in a dark narrow valley , behind me was the fresh wall of soil from the landslide . i had only one way to walk , so i began my walk down the valley . newline newline after about an hour of walking the valley opened to a clearing . in the center was something i had never seen before . it was like a tree , but it was exploding , but it was nt . like it had paused the explosion before it could burst the tree into a stump , the trunk was bowing outward in all directions . and the light coming from inside this explosion , it was such a bright white light that illuminated the clearing . the tree itself was bigger then any tree i had ever seen . it made the redwood i had guarded during spring break look like a toothpick in comparison . the top extended far into the clouds and out of my sight . newline newline after i had stood in awe of what i saw , and my mind finally gathered itself to take in some of the detail is when i noticed them . they looked so small from where i stood i had nt realized how far away they were . they were standing in a circle in front of the base of the tree . their arms stretched out towards one another , standing motionless i was nt sure if they were statues . cautious of them i slowly made my way towards their circle , curiosity was pushing me now . newline newline after walking for ten minutes i was finally drawing near them , i was in awe at how tall they actually were . each one of them was easily over 16 feet tall and was chanting in a low tone that sounded like distant thunder rumbling . silently i watched them , seeing them take breathes to continue , i stood in astonishment . then my wondering was interrupted when i heard the grunt of an old man behind me . turning , my jaw dropped to the ground as i saw one of them standing behind me . he was an old burly man at least 20 feet tall , he had a great whit beard and an eye patch over one eye . dressed in an odd robe that looked ancient and futuristic at the same time , he stood before me like an orientate mountain . he said something to me in a language that i had never heard before , but i understood it . i ca nt recreate it , every attempt sounds nothing like him . newline newline he told me not to interfere , that travelers found their way here from time to time . it is a good thing , a sign of things to come for me . he told me about the tree and all it stands for . he explained that i am part of the light , that we all are . and him and his kind keep the light from hurting the tree , in time the tree will grow around the light again . this is not the first time the light had out grown it s place in the tree , they had tended it then as they do now . balance would be restored over the years and we would be in harmony with the tree again . the tree is strong , just like us , we will both persevere and survive for a long time . that is when odin told it was time for me to go and i woke up at the parking lot where i had parked my car before my hike .i once read a story about a man searching for immortality . he found it and then promptly started to look for a cure . when you re 25 they force you to choose one form of immortality . it s unfair . it s too early . you ve barely lived and they tell you you ca nt die . newline newline and here i am . 25 . i chose to relieve the only time i was happy , one of the days of my sunny childhood , when i still knew how to laugh and play and love . i do nt know how many repeats i had already , but with each one my adult memories are fading more and more , until i have to struggle to remember any of the things i learnt past the age of 7 . i m happy again .i watched it

noticed it after they did the study and revealed what humanity had been craving for so long . newline newline newline i now sit in a hospital , watching the people come and go . it seemed normal , but everyone was overreacting and overpreparing . lawyers contacted , health benefits obtained . hundreds of thousands people dead after only a few months . it was seeping everywhere . newline newline newline i had watched that broadcast many days ago , and watched the scientist tell us our true meaning : newline newline newline  the meaning of life , the answer to all ,  i remember him saying ,  is death . sneak peak , i ll write more if you like newline newline newline newline since the demise of the dominant species , homo sapiens , an open space awaits for any with gall to claim it . as a human kingdom may rip asunder in a naked struggle for sovereignty and resources , upon the collapse of a reign , so too it is true with the kingdom of animals . allowing a violent , quick , and beautiful bout of change , that only the more bizarre of species to sprout could chance at the vacant human throne . newline newline newline newline newline newline what sort of species could it be .

ve ever been a serious  writer . i ve written , on and off , since i was eight years old , the same year that i dug out an old but functional kensington typewriter from a dumpster . that s when i set off on my life long journey as a wannabe writer , i suppose . it was certainly a positive outlet for an otherwise rough childhood  living in squalor with an alcoholic father , a deadbeat mother who was gone before my sixth birthday , and the bad men who took advantage of that fact . maybe my need to escape it , and my desire to find a voice , was part of my inspiration to write . newline newline i enjoy writing things that are mostly centered in reality . writing people . small towns . characters that are far from being perfect or special . storytelling typically focuses on heroic or villainous deeds and characters , but i m often more interested in those that do nt have to make that journey , at least not in the more epic scope . newline newline at the moment , i m working on a novel . ever so slowly though , and not terribly good , but the way i see it , the world needs bad writers too . it s how we make the shinier ones look good .i tiptoed my way down the hall , stuffing goodies in my pocket with a ridiculous smile like i was the grinch stealing christmas . wallet , phone , jewelry , the works : they d just left it all out . it had been a long time since i d had a job this easy . i made my way down the stairs slowly and carefully . i d passed a nice tv on the way in  probably not too heavy , right ? newline newline about halfway down , i heard some noises from outside . through the mottled glass , i could see someone coming in . fuck .  the family was supposed to be out for another 20 minutes ! i could nt make it back up the stairs in time . the silence was shattered as the figure outside suddenly bashed in the door window and stuck a hand through , grasping for the knob . what the hell ? this was nt the owner ! newline newline he entered the foyer , clad in all black . i froze against the staircase , wearing black myself and not blending into the creamcolored walls in the least . fuck  what do i do ?  he closed the door behind him with a gentle creak and crept into the living room . newline newline  what the hell do you think you re doing ? ?  i yelled out , trying my best to sound outraged .  get out of my house !  newline newline he spun around and trained the flashlight on me . i could see the panic in his eyes as he made a move for the front door again . right as he reached the threshold , it dawned on him .  wait a second ... .  he muttered as he turned back around .  you re robbing this place too ! this is nt your house ! how about i just rob you instead ?  newline newline damn . worth a shot , though . there was a tense standoff between us , both unsure how to proceed .  all right ,  he said finally .  we split the loot . i do nt rat on you , you do nt rat on me . deal ?  newline newline i pressed my arms up against my jacket pockets and made my way down the rest of the stairs . this was mine .  you can take the tv ,  i said , nodding into the living room at the brand new plasma screen . he followed me gaze .  no , too heavy ...  newline newline we were so busy bartering with the items that we were stealing that neither of us even noticed the back door open . newline newline  what the hell is this ?  a voice called out , snapping on the lights . both of us froze and turned back to the hallway , where the owner of the house stood holding a bag of groceries . we were like deer caught in headlights . newline newline  hey man , this guy s robbing your house !  i called out . they both looked at me , puzzled . i could almost hear the gears turning . newline newline i dashed for the door and threw my rival toward the homeowner , getting out just in time to hear the other burglar get tackled to the floor , yelling out  he was robbing you first ! ! an elderly dentist came home one day and sat at the dinner table , obviously stressed . newline newline  how was work today ?  asked the wife , concerned . newline newline  the anderson s boy has been a lifelong patient of mine . i know exactly the amount of novacaine to use , know exactly which teeth are likely to have cavities , and can tell you his flossing habits . lately , he s been getting into this  goth  thing . i was drilling a cavity and he stopped me , saying it hurt too much . i know i used the right amount , though . i told him he was just being over sensitive . he started crying and ran out of the office . do you think the

newline newline teacher s note :  as women do not feel the need to masturbate , the female class should skip ahead to section 7.5 , entitled  menstruation : how to avoid spreading your sin .  newline newline now that we have detailed the concept of abstinence and the dangers of premarital sex in the previous section , many will be wondering about masturbation to quell these urges . this too is

baby , he directed his dingy ruger mk ii toward the young family . the father stepped forward , threateningly , and one jeer from him froze the red haired man in place . the mother stood protectively in front of her son , fear poorly obscured by a weak snarl . big , green eyes peered through the empty space between the crest of her elbow and her waist . newline newline he said to the eyes , in his high , cruel voice ,  do nt worry little guy , you and your parents will still be with each other in a few minutes . there may be a brief moment of separation , but , really , do nt worry .  newline newline again , clutching the gun tighter , aim steadied , he said ,  do nt worry .  newline newline this was it . it was really happening , he was finally going to feel the rush of heinous murder , the burst of dopamine that accompanied forceful expiration of innocent human life . newline newline as he squeezed the trigger , every muscle in his body tensing with rapture , he simultaneously prayed to some evil , dark deity out of time and space that this attempt would be different , that nothing would newline newline  newline newline gerald was a fat alley cat , a cool jivin  pussy that liked sexing other feral felines , and just loved to have himself leftover scraps of meat from the adjacent italian deli . he had been napping , snoring peacefully , dreaming about yowling tabbies and ... and some pepperoni . hoowee , that sounded nice . a hot slice of steppedon salami , maybe ? newline newline his patchy , fleabitten belly grumbled , and his lazy nap was ruined . newline newline i need some food , man ,  he thought , as his stomach growled again . hot damn .  newline newline gerald followed his scratchedup pink nose along the cracked asphalt of his alley , spying a couple bigs toward its mouth . there was a grimy flash of salty flesh from under one of them . newline newline well what do we got here ,  he purred to himself . a nice chunk of bologna ? don  t mind if i do .  newline newline unfortunately for both parties , the bologna was under the biggest big  s shoe and gerald was a very fat , very determined , very hungry cat . newline newline feeling an unusual sense of territorial rage , perhaps brought on by a snickering god of misfortune , gerald extended claws from his beaten paw and slashed the big across his ankle . newline newline  newline newline happen , like the other times . newline newline i friggin  knew it ,  he thought , just before : newline newline shocked , shrieking loudly , he slipped back , and misfired over the ducking family , who soon slipped out of the alley . he heard their panicked , fading sprint as he hissed in pain on the ground , digging his nails into the skin around the wound . the goddamn piece of shit cat lazily walked up to him , peed on his nose , and sauntered away with a flap of grey meat dangling from its jowls . newline newline across the street , within the dark depths of another alley , another cat was about to commit murder . this cat , however , was human . he held a snubnosed revolver to the neck of a homeless man who had nt payed him his  insurance .   basically , this guy beats the shit outta you if you do nt pay him not toand straightup kills you if you refuse to pay , even after so many beatings .  newline newline as he cocked the hammer , as he grinned in  righteous  fury , as he said ,  sorry charlie ,  a bullet whistled karmically through the air and through his neck , burying itself into the brick wall at the end of the alley . newline newline the homeless man stared in shock as blood spurted from the neck of al  illfuckyouthefuckup  jones . he squinted past the empty street , past the haze of shitty streetlights , and into another alley , where a man sat on his haunchesgun tip smoking , eyes filled with hate , mouth screwed up like he ate a lemon . newline newline  thankya friend !  he shouted , to which the mysterious stranger growled and disappeared into the shadows . newline newline  huh ,  mumbled charlie the homeless man ,  i did nt even get to invite him to my box for a celebratory halfeaten meal .  newline newline  newline newline he paced in his lair , evil , iceblue eyes reflecting the glow of his many monitors . newline newline where had he gone wrong ? he seemed to have done everything correctly , planned for every contingency , and yet nothing went right . newline newline oh , he was nt just thinking about the happenings of the previous night , where he failed simply to kill three powerless idiots , three innocent passersby that just happened to pass by the wrong alley . no , that was a mere hiccup compared to some of the world shifting deeds he had accidentally played a role in . newline newline his was a past filled with fuckups , both small and grand in scale . newline newline there was the bombing in uganda , where he had originally planned to destroy a large chunk of johannesburg , south africa . due to a  freak surge of cosmic radiation  the satellites responsible sent the explosive payload some 2,000miles north eastwhere a slaver of hundreds of child soldiers was getting up from a 12hour sleep to eat and start on a day of rape  pillage . he , his rabid lieutenants and his hut were atomized on impact . newline newline there was the cancer cure incident . utilizing his genius intellect and the great well of resources available to him , he developed a previouslyunknown form of radiation , one he postulated could wipe out humanity in one fellswoop . luckily , before he attempted to disperse among enemy states and government offices , he tested the radiation on lab rats . turned out , it cured their quickly forming rattumors . disheartened , but realizing this had great potential , he wrote up a pitch to sell the cure to pharmaceutical companies and black market doctors  as well as worldwide organizations , from which he planned to hold the  formula  hostage . however , unluckily for him , he fell asleep at his desk and during one of his more violent night terrors managed to leak all of his notes and discoveries across the internet . his name was attached to none of it . various governments around the world claimed responsibility , and it was soon agreed upon that this belonged to the world , no one lucky nation . newline newline and there were others , so many damned others . yet it seemed , despite his most sinister efforts , none of his deeds ever played out just how he wanted . in fact , they ended up as exactly the opposite of what he wanted . newline newline he had a sudden revelation . newline newline i can be immortal ,  he thought . there was a brief moment where he felt like laughing at how ridiculous a premise that was , but he stopped himself . newline newline nothing evil he did ever panned out . really , it always ended in good . and since he was always doing something evil , or trying at the very least , he was always doing something good . so if in a situation where he was close to death , on the brink of oblivion , all he had to do was ... attempt suicide . newline newline it would nt be creating a paradox , because he was nt actually evil . his intent was evil , but did nt that cliche phrase say actions speak louder than words ? newline newline if he was the greatest force of good on the planet , and all of his evil deeds backfired , what would happen if he evilly tried to kill the greatest good , himself ? newline newline gleefully , on a stupid crazed impulse , he twirled his ruger , turning it on himself . newline newline whispering ,  welcome to godhood ,  he pulled the trigger . newline newline  newline newline  ah ,  sighed fate , wiping some sweat from her brow . she looked very pleased with herself . newline newline  what s got you so satisfied ?   questioned love , oblivious to the tiny loveless blip in human history . newline newline  well , earth now has one less psychopath .   hello , and welcome !  trilled a high pitched and cultivated voice you had only heard on television once a year . you could nt place the source of the voice as it reverberated around the stone walls but there was no doubt it was her , with a capital h. apparently what you had said had earned you the right to be a captive audience for her majesty . newline newline  wh ... . where am i ?  you stammer out . the simple act of speaking taking far more effort than it should , you rest for a moment . that moment stretches out interminably as you wait for a response . newline newline suddenly you can hear breath right against the harsh fabric of the bag over your head . unlike your own ragged and panicked expulsions , this is steady , even menacing before the words come :  clearly , you knew the magic words to get into my castle .  newline newline her up close voice is so different from the stage voice you have always associated with the queen , you doubt for a moment that there s just the two of you in this chamber . this new snarling tone continues , dripping with scorn ,  we shall be quite amused to see if you can string the right ones together to get out again . i held her picture close to me and still remembered her words .  i don  t like girls ,  she said ,  i only make out with them when i  m drunk . sorry.  newline newline it was foolish of me to ever think that there could be something between us . she was the first girl i ever loved . newline newline jillian newline newline i unfolded the picture . my arm was around her and we were both smiling in our bathing suits . the moment i touched her tan skin , i knew that there was something more than friendship . but i guess it was just me newline newline i tore the picture in half and let it fall a long way down . newline newline  i  m sorry , but i can

newline newline  hey , baby , you okay ?  she asked . newline newline i opened my eyes and looked around . had it all been a dream ? what was going on ? newline newline  delilah , are you okay ?  she asked again . newline newline i turned to see jillian . her hair darker than it used to be and in a glamorous pixie cut . she seemed older than i remembered . newline newline  jill ? what are you ?  i asked . newline newline  shh , babe , it was only a bad dream . go back to sleep , my love.  newline newline  butwhat  s going on ?  newline newline  what do you mean ? honey , get some sleep . richie

had no idea what was going on . did i just have a dream ? or was i dreaming now ? newline newline  remember our wedding ?  jillian laughed . newline newline no , i don  t .   yes , of course ,  i replied ,  i guess i  m just tired.  newline newline  we had matching dresses , just like i wanted , and pink flowers everywhere ! oh , it was beautiful !  newline newline pink flowers ?  matching dresses ? that doesn  t sound like me newline newline suddenly , something jumped up on the bed . i gasped . newline newline  calm down , del , it  s just our cat , miss prissy.  newline newline i glanced down at the cat . it was disgusting . i hated cats .  miss prissy  s  long white hair got everywhere . jillian picked her up and began speaking to her in a babyish tone . newline newline  oh , del ,  she said ,  aren  t you glad we got miss prissy instead of that big dumb yellow lab you wanted ?  newline newline yellow labs were my favorite kind of dog . what the hell was this nightmare ? newline newline  i have good news , pumpkin !  she said . i couldn  t tell if she was talking to me or the cat .  i was going to wait to tell you this , but i got a procedure and it took !  newline newline  what ?  oh , god , please , no !  newline newline  i  m pregnant ! i know you were hesitant before , but it  s going to be great ! if it  s a girl , i  m going to enter her in pageants , just like me ! she  ll be a little model !  newline newline   newline newline i woke up gasping and anxiously looking around . in front of me , my laptop glows . i read the words  i just can  t live without her . there  s nothing to live for anymore . goodbye.  i quickly deleted them . newline newline i sighed and reclined back in my chair . suddenly , my phone buzzes . newline newline i open a text from a girl name mel who sits next to me in history . newline newline i heard about what happened with jillian . if you want to talk about it , i was rejected by my first lesbian crush , too . maybe we could have lunch ? if you want newline newline i smiled a little as i read the words . i replied . newline newline do you like cats or dogs ?  newlinethomas wondered how they came to this . we need to talk . the words were still bouncing through his mind . newline newline  tommy ? hello ?  the voice on the other end of the cell asked for his attention . he realized that he had nt responded . newline newline  i m here .  play it smooth , he told himself .  what do we need to talk about ? did you get a ,  thomas paused before saying ,  promotion .  his mouth had gotten ahead of his brain . his friends were always telling him to think before speaking . he had to say something . newline newline  no . just come by my apartment when you get off work .  newline newline he stammered an okay as he glanced at the clock on his office wall . thirty minutes until he could leave . he had 45 minutes to find a way to make the relationship with carla work . his mind returned the phone . newline newline  ... dinner . bye tommy .  newline newline he did nt even say goodbye as he pressed the red button on his phone . he loved the way she said his name . he leaned back in his chair . he looked at his computer screen through the side of his eyes . he could nt focus on work now . he let his mind drift to all the good times he and carla shared . newline newline they had been together for two years . he was saving up money for an engagement ring . they were supposed to get married and spend life together . jan , his friend and secretary , told him that he was moving too slow . she could cover for him if he left work now . he walked to the door determined to make whatever compromises needed to make things work . newline newline thomas pulled up to the apartment complex thirty minutes later , since he took a long route to get there as he planned his words . he was ready to win his fair lady s heart again . he walked up to the door searching through his key chain for the spare key . she wanted to wait until marriage before living together . he smiled as he remembered the way she looked in that summer dress when that conversation came up last year . the smile turned into a frown as he turned the door knob . newline newline the aroma of incense invaded his nose . he did nt mind the scent , but it struck him as weird that she would be burning incense . she hated the smell of candles and preferred opening the window when the place needed to smell fresher . he looked around the living room . the coffee table was pushed against the couch . concern replaced the sadness on his face . newline newline  thomas , honey ? is that you ,  carla s voice asked from the kitchen . newline newline  yeah . why did you move the coffee table ?  newline newline  i did some yoga earlier and just have nt moved it back .  newline newline  really ? i thought you said yoga was for the easily deceived ,  he asked confused ? newline newline she walked around the corner . she was sporting another summer dress  her hair was pulled back in a ponytail . carla looked at him .  i made you a plate , but i could nt wait . it smelled so good .  she was either ignoring the question or did nt hear him , but thomas decided not to push the issue . newline newline thomas sniffed , but he could still only smell burning incense .  this little old man was selling a bunch of organic fruits on the side of the road . i never stop , but i wanted to make you a special meal . anyway , i asked him if he knew any unique recipes . he gave me one and said that it was guaranteed to keep a couple together forever .  newline newline  what are you talking about ? what s going on ? you called and said we need to talk .   newline newline her body immediately tensed as her playful expression changed to one of regret or sadness .  you are going to want to sit down .  newline newline thomas glanced at the inaccessible couch .  i think i ll stand .  newline newline  i m sorry . thomas , i m so sorry .  tears ran down her face .  i m pregnant .  newline newline  how can you be pregnant ? you said we were waiting until we married .  the shock was quickly replaced with devastation . thomas wished he was sitting . newline newline  i know ,  her words were barely audible .  it was a onetime mistake . i was drunk .  newline newline  drunk ? !  the devastation was slowly being replaced with anger . he was prepared to give anything to make the relationship work , but this was not a scenario he was ready to handle .  you do nt drink at bars . you said you never trust the bartender .  his voice was slowly rising . newline newline  i was nt at a bar . i was at mary s . she had invited barry .  newline newline  barry . barry golds . you slept with our small group leader .  he realized that his voice was definitely yelling . newline newline  it s not like that . i do nt even remember it .  her voice was rising in defense . newline newline  how do you not remember it ? do nt lie to me .  he was certain that neighbors could hear , but he did nt care . newline newline carla s heart began beating faster and faster as the panic set in . this was nt happening as she planned .  they said i blacked out , but i only had a couple ...  the words were nt coming anymore . the panic of losing thomas was replaced with the panic of getting the next breath . newline newline thomas ran to her and caught her as she fell . the anger was replaced with fear and concern for her life . her body convulsed in his arms .  you ca nt die .  he repeated the words over and over . he pulled out his cell phone and tried to dial 911 , but this thumb was nt working . in frustration , he threw the cell phone at the wall and turned all of his attention on her .  do nt leave me like this .  tears streamed down his face as her body stopped moving . he held her close and wept . newline newline five minutes later , he recovered enough to realize that he still needed to call someone . he looked over at his phone , the cracks were evident . thomas  phone was a lost cause . he began feeling his girlfriend s pockets for her phone . newline newline a twitch . thomas felt her body twitch . she was still alive , he thought . relief tried to grip the back of consciousness . he turned his head to carla s face hoping against hope that there would be signs of life . her eyes were open and looking at his . she was alive . he sat up and turned to pull her close . newline newline as his hands reached for her , he noticed that eyes were nt right . the life was nt there , but they were nt empty either . reason told him that it was safer to not hug her . she slowly sat up and turned to look at him . the motions were nt right . newline newline he scooted back ,  carla ?  newline newline there was no response . carla opened and closed her mouth like she was chewing . her eyes consumed him hungrily . she twisted toward him and began crawling , her mouth still chewing the nonexistent food . newline newline thomas stood up and backed into the kitchen . carla slowly stood up . he grabbed the largest knife from the knife block ,  carla ? sweetie ? do nt do this .  newline newline there was a knock on the door , but thomas ignored it . carla s body took another step . thomas held the knife in front of him defensively . another knock . another step . newline newline  hello ? this is the police . we got a call about a ...  the voice from the other side of the door called out . newline newline carla lunged . thomas reached forward with his knife hand . the knife slid into the underside of the jaw . carla s body went limp and fell into his hands . newline newline shaken . he turned and dropped her body . another knock . newline newline he walked to the door and opened it . officer charles pentz and officer benjamin baily stood surprised to see a man unaware that he was covered in his girlfriend s blood . help was the only word thomas could mutter . both officers drew their guns . officer baily kept an eye on thomas , while officer pentz slid around him . newline newline after a quick survey of the apartment , pentz told baily to arrest thomas for the murder of carla . thomas could barely process the next few hours . he remembered being told his rights , but that could have been his mind saying that it happened because all the cop shows show the miranda rights being read . he had a better memory of the inprocessing . newline newline  thomas carter ,  asked a voice . newline newline hearing his name shook the remaining shock off his brain . he turned to see who had called him and registered that he was indeed under arrest and sitting , handcuffed , in a mostly empty room . newline newline  according to the statement you gave at the scene , your girlfriend died and then ... tried to eat you . i m going to be honest , her neighbors heard the argument . this does nt look good for you . why do nt you tell me what happened ?  newline newline thomas focused on the woman speaking . he opened his mouth and began telling the investigator what happened . he remembered the argument and worked through her last words again . his brain finished her thoughts . he believed that she was going to say she was drugged and raped . he wanted to believe it . he had to believe it . he had nt realized that tears were streaming down his face . newline newline  so you after you argued ,  she prodded . newline newline thomas did his best to continue . before he reached the point of saying he stabbed her in the face , there was a knock on the mirror . the investigator turned to the door , opened , and stepped through it . thomas could hear the sounds of an argument outside . the door opened , and two other people walked through . newline newline the man was dressed in a suit . the woman wore a business skirt . she approached the table , while the man stood at the door . newline newline  i know you ve had a rough day what with your wife eating the root of the cadaver flower . we know what happened , we believe you , and we can help you . the first thing to flash through my mind was the man just an hour earlier who had offered to buy my lottery ticket off of me for a hundred thousand dollars , cash . newline newline not a small sum of money , i had declined only because of stubbornness and irritability after a rough day at work . plus , with the way he was dressed , i suspected he was some sort of eccentric criminal hobo who would just take the ticket and run . and yes , i reflectively could admit , i was so addicted to gambling that i d rather take an infinitely small chance at winning big than a guarantee of winning slightly less big . newline newline now , as the television repeated itself   3 , 4 , 14 , 26 , 29 , bonus number 18 !   i stared down numbly at my ticket . newline newline i was a millionaire . no , scratch that , a millionaire was someone with just a million dollars . i was a multimillionaire . a  17,300,000aire , to be exact , payed either in a lump sum or over twenty years as i pleased . newline newline thank god i had nt accepted the money , although now i wondered how the man had known i was going to win tonight ... newline newline  excuse me .  a melodious and whispery voice spoke into my small flat s living room . newline newline i jumped , screamed , crumpled the ticket in a sudden iron fist , nearly bolted towards the door . the only thing blocking my escape was the muscle bound man standing in front of it . newline newline  excuse me .  he repeated , and i marveled briefly at such a feminine voice coming from such a slab of masculinity .  i just need a moment of your time .  newline newline he  she ?  stepped into my flat , allowing me to see that curiously , the door was still shut and deadbolted behind him . newline newline  twentieth century andorless one , low income , new york skylight behind . acceptatious .  it looked at me , then suddenly barked out at me in a rough , deep , raspy voice . newline newline  i m detective samuels with the us fbi irs ! we re dispatched to investigate your suspicious lottery winnings !  newline newline he glowered at me , took another step forward .  my first question , curmudgeon . who is the current president ?  newline newline i stammered , my mind completely blank , and i spoke the first presidential name i could think of .  uh ... nixon ?  newline newline he stopped , tilted his head at me .  next question , lucky punk . name an unforgettable celebrity that just had their first minute of fame , whom history shant forget .  newline newline what sort of question was that ... again , i spoke immediately , in a panic .  justin ... bieber , i think ? maybe ?  newline newline his arm lowered to his side , rippling against the black fabric ominously .  last chance , beaver cleaver . what is the current stock value of walmart incorporated ?  newline newline i backed away , protesting .  how the hell would i know ? who the hell are you ? !  newline newline the pain spiked in a strange way , as first my feet dissolved , then my legs ... slowly , up to my head , then the pain stopped at last . i wondered if i were dead , but slowly realized i could still see , and move even , somewhat . i spotted the ticket fluttering down and latched onto it , rolling over to try and intercept it before it hit the ground . newline newline a jar slammed over me , blocking my route . the man grabbed the ticket before it could touch my dingy carpet , put it perfunctorily into a small case at his side . i could read the word evidence  on it in flowery script ... then i could nt ... then a moment later , i could again . newline newline  suspected time exploiter captured .  he murmured out loud , once again using the fluttery voice .  the suspect failed the tripled time situational awareness confirmation quiz , as was predicted , and has been reduced to the standard prisoner transportation mode for his trial . he will be permitted to speak at his trial , and no sooner than then , per protocol to avoid further temporal contamination . a trace has been initiated to determine the extent of all quantum fallout from his activities .  newline newline he hefted the jar  my jar , i suppose  and began carrying me towards the door . as we passed my mirror , i saw myself . newline newline an eyeball in a jar looked back at me , looking as though it wished to scream . newline newline we vanished . i m sick of your shit , bruce  said rick , coughing unconcernedly at his cards .  either play or fold , do nt buweerp make me come over there and play for you . because i will .  newline newline batman s eyes narrowed at the mention of his real name , but chose to do nothing and instead stared at his two aces . how could this happen so early in the game ? he d been folding consistently the last couple of rounds to establish a pattern , but now he d have to either break the pattern early or fold on really good cards . newline newline then again , he was bruce wayne , a little money lost meant nothing . he folded , silently . newline newline  good thing too , those aces would have beweerp woulda got you nowhere .  newline newline  aces ?  yelled stanley , throwing his cards at table ,  dammit rick , how can anyone play if you re going to keep peeking at their cards !  newline newline  cocksucker !  yelled revvy , flipping the table and all its contents whilst simultaneously drawing her beretta and shooting through rick s cards , and then levelling it at his forehead .  give me one reason why i should nt blow your brains out .  newline newline batman leapt from his seat the instant the table was turned , and moved to snatch her gun and move it out of rick s way , giving revvy an intense look whilst she drew her spare with her free hand and pointed it at his crotch . newline newline rick yawnedburpedrolled his eyes and clapped sarcastically   oh well done , real sign of maturity there .  he kicked his feet back on the end of the table  now on it s side  and rocked back on his chair ,  hey everyone let s all jump to conclusions that rick was cheating ...  newline newline  oh uh  haha . you were guessing ?  asked stanley , grinning apologetically and diving for his cards . newline newline  it s called being smart ,  said rick taking a swig from his side flask , and then tucking it away ,  and it s wasted on little miss coyote over here  . newline newline  that s it i m   began revvy , but rick pressed a button and a large transparent bubble expanded around revvy and batman and silenced whatever she yelled next . stanley and rick let out a sigh of audible relief . newline newline  aah , i have a kid at home who needs one of these  said stanley , and then pausing ,  two actually . no ... four .  newline newline things inside the bubble were getting intense , but neither rick nor stanley seemed to care . newline newline  yeah , not for sale buddy  proclaimed rick , taking yet another swig from his bottle . newline newline  oh come on you ca nt be serious ?  said stanley , righting the table and placing the contents back on . newline newline  no hweerp way , can you just imagine the consequences if this thing got out ? nuhuh not again .  newline newline stanley paused and considered his cards .  i ll play you for it .  newline newline  you re on . the room shook as he stared into her eyes . with one squeeze , he had forever changed the course of his life . the ringing sound in his ears began to consume him  it became the implacable memory that would forever define this moment . and as he looked at his wife , blood slowly trickling from her mouth as she attempted to speak in jilted , sputtering movements , he began to wonder . newline what had led to this moment ? 6 years ago , he watched as the woman he loved slid a solid , gold ring onto his finger . now , 6 long years later , he watched as she slowly bled out lying against the wall of their bedroom , the horrified cries of her lover doing little to pierce the silence he kept inside of himself . it really was her fault , he reasoned . i ve kept her from something awful , a condemnation to hell for her acts of infidelity . for in her last moments , he had blessed her with his forgiveness in the hopes that a just god might overlook her past transgressions . he had saved her eternal soul . and yet ... newline it really was nt her unfaithfulness that had brought this . it was something else . it was the way she made him coffee . it was the way she talked . it was the look of fear in her eyes that she could somehow never seem to drown out . but more than anything , it was the bitterness in his heart , not towards her , not from anything she had ever done , but from some intangible quality that he possessed as a form of spite towards a life he deemed unjust . when he pulled the trigger , as he watched the light leave her eyes and heard the blood rattle in her throat as she exhaled for the final time , it was then that he finally understood something about himself that he had never realized , and he let out a long overdue laugh , totally disinterested in the pair of fear crazed eyes watching him nervously from the bed .i do nt have a lot of time , but some preliminary thoughts . newline newline  tai started to stalk away from me . newline newline  as she began to take off in the opposite direction . newline newline  the wind began to pick up newline newline  the air began to moisten newline newline  my stomach began to do backflips newline newline  my phone started charming newline newline  my legs started carrying my weighty frame newline newline  i started to frantically run through the house . newline newline stop doing that . there is no reason to clarify that these actions have a beginning . that is obvious . just give us the action . think of how much punchier it is , therefore more effective , to say :  the wind picked up  or  tai stalked away from me  or  the air moistened .  newline newline in general you have an overreliance on adverbs , which in the amateur s hands tend to attach to verbs that imply the adverb anyway . for example ,  whipping violently   which you use twice in one paragraph   whipping tends to be a violent image , so what use is it saying so ? by contrast ,  gently whipping  would be an interesting image , and a fine place to drop an adverb , but the word  violently  does nt add anything . be precise and be succinct . newline newline but really the main problem with the piece beyond these style mistakes  everyone makes them  is that the whole  beautiful suicide  thing is oldhat . shakespeare did this in the 1600s , so the bar is set a little high . and you have nt done enough legwork to establish why i should care about these starcrossed teen lovers . i barely know their names before they re slitting their wrists in despair . newline newline a little characterization will help the story a lot more than leaning on melodramatic phrasing that only serves to elbow the audience s ribs and say  be sad now .  when i read a line like : newline newline  yet now , i stood numbly . i stood alone , tears streaming down my pale face as i ignored the storm that was now setting in , making the sky as dark as midnight , mocking the romantic midnight back in may . newline newline well , i know how you want me to feel  the keen sense of losing a first love  but i do nt feel it because you have nt taken me through it far enough or deeply enough to make me understand these two as real people in a real human relationship . flowery language is not a tenth as effective as building up tangible characters through tangible details  who they are , how they act , what they actually do together .it was hot and i was sweaty , my extra large ironic pedobear tshirt that i had on fit a little tight and it was bothersome , i had the sensation that one of my stomach rolls was hanging out but i did nt want to fix it as i already was excreting much of my effort by standing in line at this liquor . there where four people ahead of me , three of them i paid no mind to but the girl directly infront of me was a sight for sore eyes . my eyes raced around her body like a formula 1 at the grand prix i was sprung . newline newline she had long blonde locks and perfect sun kissed skin . she could nt have been a day older than twenty yet she was buying alcohol it does nt matter because this place rarely cards . i was busy running fantasy relationship scenarios in my head of me and this chick when i had nt noticed that she was already at the clerk a very worn out looking indian fellow who had just asked my dream girl for some identification . her face went blank but then she pointed at me and said  no look my daddy is paying for this , come ! come !  . it took me a while to process what was going on but i played along . i adjusted my jorts and scratched my right shin with the sandal through the sock on my left foot , then i proceeded to the clerk .  i am this maidens father and these alcoholic beverages are mine to consume .  i said to the clerk as i placed my acne ointment and a bag of cheetos puffs on the counter near the register . i paid for my items and hers aswell thinking i could score some brownie points with the blonde . the blonde reached across the counter for the bag of alcoholic drinks and proceeded to say a high pitched drawn out  thanks  , i bowed with my left arm stretched out and my right arm on my fedora like they do in medieval times i thought i must have looked pretty bad ass to her but as i raised my head to hopefully be greeted by eye contact with my fair maiden she was gone . newline newline by this time i could feel the sweat dripping down my face and being caught on my neck stubble but i powered through the high seventy degree fahrenheit heat and attempted to search for her in the parking lot . the heat was really bothering me so i had to untie my tactical ponytail to provide my neck with some much needed shade , i spotted her climbing into the passenger seat of a lifted black pickup she had to lift one of her knees really high up in order to mount the thing but she managed . i began clearing my throat and licking my dry lips , i started to say  pardon me dear madam but i was wondering if you  but then the pickup sped off and directly merged into traffic . that is the last i ll probably ever see of my beautiful sweet blonde dream and what made matters worse was that my ointment was in the bag with all the alcohol .being reborn as a tree was frustrating . being reborn in her backyard made it worse . newline newline committing suicide was nt an easy decision , but i could nt bear living without her . knowing i d never be with her again removed the element of fantasy and hope from my life . when i saw she d cheated , when she told me she did nt love me anymore , ever , i felt my heart sink . the floor i d been standing on for years collapsed beneath me . committing suicide was nt a decision at all , it was the only available option . newline newline i do nt know how long it took , but here i am . could have been five years , may have been twenty . it took me a while to sense that i was alive , even longer to sense the people around me . but when she pulled my first apple off and laughed of excitement , i could feel the vibrations . she woke me up . newline newline she s moved on . i ca nt tell who he is , but i can feel children , i can feel happiness , i can feel warmth . i wonder if she misses me but there are no signs that she does . i ache for the days she comes to pick apples . i ve been training to drop leaves and fruit on my own accord , waiting for the day she ll just venture to sit under my shade with a book . somehow hoping that she ll understand the sign . but she never does  the modern life surrounds her , no time for sitting under trees . newline newline i ve come to terms with my fate . i want it all to end again . i hoped to stop growing fruit , thinking they may chop me down for my inefficiencies . but nature continues . they grow despite my sadness , despite my unwillingness to bear them . i believe firmly in god now . i know that this is some sick punishment for taking my life early . i must sit here in pain and agony , watch her live , love , maybe die , and only wonder what could have been . newline newline newline but superman ca nt we do something ?  flash was trying very hard not to run in

are you still washing your hands ?  newline newline adam :  that s just it ! we know the basics , but want to know the details , like ... how much experience , if any , do we get from killing germs ? do different things give different amounts ? and how can we use explosions to get exciting results ?  newline newline jaimie :  i can think of a few ways we can setup this experiment and get those

newline newline tory and grant :  woah .  newline newline tory :  i m surprised we re allowed to tackle this ... but i guess no one else is willing to .  newline newline grant :  who even decided to turn to us for something this big ?  newline newline kari :  i m actually pretty excited about this ! in fact , i know just how to start this off ! we re going to first test the myth that inanimate

newline newline grant :  i can do you even better ! i ll design a machine that ll have him leveling up in no time !  newline newline kari :  well ... i guess i m left with finding things to get

murmuring or rumbling that usually flowed through a crowd , the silence broken only by the few people trying to push their way through , screaming to unmask him so they could finally quench their curiosity . gordon began pushing his way to the scene , still in disbelief , he was convinced it was just another vigilante wannabe in baseball pads . newline newline he fell to his knees , sobbing when he saw what was beyond the caution tape . the mob of curious pedestrians was beginning to become unruly  there were nt enough officers there to hold them all back . gordon could nt control

gotham city ! hehehehe ! we have suffered the most tragic loss tonight . the bat is dead ! i m bored now , so we re going to start a new game . i will give the man responsible one chance to come forward . if i do nt have him , alive , by sunrise , i ll just have to take the usual suspects out ! one at a time .  batman s body was gone , the crowd was just beginning to come to . newline newline there was a new vigilante in gotham , not the one it deserved , but the one it needed .he came wordlessly in the night as darkness seemed to shroud him , even under direct light . his red skin crept and crawled as he shivered while his black eyes became fixed upon me . closing my grimoire , which specialized in powerful ice magic , i greeted my unannounced but not unexpected guest . icicles hung from his blackened talons which he called nails and a fin layer of snow powdered his shoulders , but no amount of ice could obscure evil incarnate as the two horns raised from his crown announced his identity . newline newline  cup of tea ?  i offered .  you look like you  ve hit blizzard on your over here.  newline newline  what did you do ?  he exclaimed in an agitated tone which told me he wanted to skip the pleasantries . newline newline  i  m afraid you  ll have to be more specific ,  i answered .  since you and i last met , i  ve learned quite a few more spells , helped the archangel michael with souls leaking from heaven , and , oh , i opened a bakery . business is good  thanks for asking.  newline newline  i should flay you ,  he replied . his stare pushed daggers through my skin , but i swallowed any fear and proceeded . newline newline  you should ,  i agreed .  but you haven  t , which tells me you need me alive.  newline newline  i do ,  he sighed .  as i  m sure you  re more than well aware , hell has frozen over . so , bounded to my word as a demon and the devil himself , i must grant you your wish.  newline newline  oh !  i exclaimed .  what a completely unexpected delight ! but now that you mention it , i  m having a bit of a problem someone of yourdisposalcan help me with . you see , in my numerous studies and adventures , i might have given death a slight injury , which created this terrible side effect of people not dying . trivial matter to you , of course , but it  s rather vexing to us mortals . can you heal her ?  newline newline  i can ,  he answered . newline newline  perfect ,  i replied .  but there is one , little matter that i want to bring up before you grant my wish.  newline newline  which is ?  newline newline  i know as soon as you grant my wish , you  re going to play skip rope with my intestines , so i prepared a little insurance : from my understanding hell is frozen , right ? well as it just so happens , i was just catching up on some spells regarding ice magic.  newline newline he grumbled as he understood where my proposition was going . newline newline  so here  s my deal ,  i started .  grant me my wish , spare me afterwards , and i bring hell back to the glory of fire and brimstone that we all know and love.  newline newline  deal ,  he replied reluctantly . we shook on our agreement and after performing a spell to undo the damage to hell , he brought back death to full health . thus after bringing about undue damage to the natural order of things , i managed to live another day to do it all again . newline newline  newline newline more devilish stories at randrewwellsif you re reading this , i successfully killed myself , or completely forgot where this note was put and you found it

melodramatic is apparently my thing right now . newline newline but that s shit . newline life has sucked for ... longer than i feel like trying to remember . sometimes it s sucked less , and

that your name was said , but your attention is drawn in a certain direction and you feel like you ve been called , but are nt sure to where ? newline newline i ve had that feeling my whole life . there s been this gnawing in the back of my mind ever since i was little that i m being called somewhere or someone just out of sight has spoken my name , and right as i turn my head the moment is lost . in all honestly it s been a little aggravating at times , and as a result i ve been on and off couches and have been on the business end of a clipboard who knows how many times . newline newline now that i m older  twentysix , not that it s any of your business  i ve learned to cope with it , somewhat . the itch is still there but i try to stay busy and drown it out with conversation or , worse comes to worse , ambien . my husband has been incredibly supportive . he understands my need for some type of background nice pretty much always , and i ve always been able to focus on him and calm the storm when it gets too rough . newline newline i knew it was too good to last . newline newline i woke three nights ago in a cold sweat , having heard my name clear as day . but ... gosh i do nt know how to explain this . my name was being shouted in my head all at once , not over and over , but stretched out ... but not like  laaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaa .  it was just  lara ,  by itself , stretching on forever . i do nt know how else to put it ... newline newline after fifteen minutes i nearly took a razor to my wrist . my head was pounding , my pulse racing . my husband tried to bring me back to bed but i could nt bear the thought of lying down . newline newline i ran outside , ran down the stillslick streets towards the sound . of course , it was nt a sound so much as a feeling of where the sound came from ... i know i do nt make sense . sue me . newline newline the dark streets offered little solace as i ran barefoot in nothing besides my pajamas . after an hour i was drenched in sweat , chest heaving , as i stopped before the wall . newline newline as you know , the wall keeps us from ourselves . our other halves , our twins . there are a lot of theories floating around as to why we re separated  my personal favorite was always that meeting your twin gave you magic powers  , but nothing from the government ever gave any real answers . our ancestors set down the law , and we follow it . newline newline for some reason there were no guards . no spotlights , no border patrol . newline newline but there was a grate . newline newline i approached it , slowly , wondering if i was crazy and i d finally driven myself insane with the selfmedicating . the dirt was hard and cold beneath my bruised and bloodied feet . newline newline there was a latch , broken , and the gate swung open with a small creak . of course it s open ,  i thought , horror films playing through my head as i told myself how stupid it would be to crawl inside . newline newline the small semicircular tunnel i found insight was dimly lit by small blueish flickering leds set in the mosscovered stone . as i shuffled forward on my hands and knees i peered into the heavy dark , and realized there was a lump of something round halfway through the hall . newline newline as i came closer i saw it was a person . well , more accurately it looked like a body . newline newline the lights were all but out here , save one that flickered hesitantly over the crumpled figure . newline newline some part of me noticed that i could nt hear my name in my own head any more , but my attention was elsewhere . newline newline pale skin , bruised and wan was wrapped in dark rags soaked in blood . tangled hair too dirty to tell the color of pasted itself around a mouth frozen in a silent scream , and wide eyes stared blankly up into nothing . newline newline my eyes , i realized . the figure before me was my twin . the hair on the back of my neck stood as i began to panic . newline newline her hands darted out like cobras , reaching up and behind her to clutch my face in a viselike grip . she gasped a rasping breath , her eyes focusing to stare into mine as i screamed in terror . newline newline try as i might , i could nt pull away . her hands held me still with the jealous intensity of death itself . she forced my eyes to hers as she rasped out a single word . newline newline   lara .   newline newline and as i watched her die , i also felt her die . by this i do nt mean i felt something slip away , but rather i felt something join with me . newline newline it s been three days , and i can not stop the voices . at first i thought they were the thoughts of my neighbors , but now l know they re not . newline newline listen to me when i tell you that we re not the only ones . there is nt some benevolent government keeping birth rates under control by taking pregnant women and making sure twins stay separate from each other . we are sheep in a fold . i

form of intense energy rippling waves through the air . my body warped in and out of flux . from some unknown place within i felt the  i  separating from the  me   lifting away , like flesh and tendon from bone . writhing , inward and outward , i screamed across the aeons from the pain . slowly , something was pulling , rising me away from my body , forcing me to come to look down upon it from above . newline newline in a momentary millennium my soul had been torn free of its flesh . on the ground my body twisted , contorting into the odd shapes of seizure . drifting on the ethereal waves , i watched my former vessel with an odd horror  rather than fall over dead , becoming an empty soulless husk , it stood . with darkened eyes i  it  seemed to almost look right at me for a moment . if i had had some sort of nervous system i would have shivered , to come face to face with oneself  but as it were i could only rest on the lulling ripples and watch in shock . my former face twisted into a grotesque grin , my body turned , walking away of its own accord  leaving me to my own fate . to the looming portal above . newline newline my shock subsiding , i finally took notice of it . the swirling black maw of electrified mist  an abyss of purest energy , slowly pulling me inward . i could feel its hunger  its power reverberating palpably through the ether in which i hung . newline newline my fate , it seemed , was to have my soul slowly corrupted and ingested . lenses , mr . oneil ?  newline newline  yyes , sir . lenses ,  james stammered nervously . for a moment he realized how crazy he must sound . newline newline the director adjusted himself in his chair and then fiddled with his tie for a moment ,  and how , if i may ask , did you find these lenses ?  newline newline it had been the third case in a week . a relatively healthy young person who had apparently acquired an acute case of paranoid schizophrenia long after the average age of onset . there was no family history of such disturbances and no warning signs . all three bodies had similar injuries and cause of death  extreme selfinflicted claw marks around the eyes and spontaneous cardiac arrest compounded by extremely high levels of adrenaline and sleep deprivation indicated a death caused by , quite simply , pure fear . but why the eyes ? newline newline  i decided to cut into the eyes ,  oneil paused for a moment before continuing ,  it is against protocol , i know , but i had to know why they all clawed at their own eyes . my findings , no sign of external trauma , no allergic or chemical reactions present . but , i found scars .  newline newline the director cleared his throat ,  scars , mr . oneil ?  newline newline  yes , scars .  newline newline  is that not to be expected ?  he narrowed his eyes at the fraillooking examiner across from him . newline newline  nno , sir . mechanical damage caused by the scratching would nt have had time to scar . and anyway , these were surgical scars .  newline newline the portly director rested his eyes upon the cigar humidifier on his desk , but did nt reach for one .  is this unusual ? corrective vision surgery is quite common these days , examiner .  newline newline  no history of it , sir . and the incisions did nt match up with laser surgery . that is when i discovered ...  newline newline  the lenses ?  newline newline oneil nodded ,  the lenses .  newline newline  and you claim that you saw images in these lenses ?  the director asked . he was now fiddling with an unlit cigar . newline newline  as strange as it sounds ... yes ,  the examiner took a moment to swallow before speaking again ,  more like videos . the images moved . i could barely make them out , blurry , but it was like a video . a miniature screen .  newline newline the director glared ,  i think you ve been watching too much science fiction , oneil . this sort of thing just does nt exist yet . projector lenses ?  he scoffed . newline newline  maybe , sir , but i saw what i saw .  newline newline  and what did you see ?  a raised eyebrow . newline newline james oneil looked around the office nervously ,  i saw people . they were in the room with me . i could nt make out the faces , but they ... i thought i could feel them . this was nt just ... a projection , sir . one appeared to be sitting on the table . that d have to be active software or ...  newline newline the director was smiling . it was that sort of smile an adult gives a child caught in a ridiculous lie . but , somehow he also looked worried .  and where is your proof , examiner oneil ?  newline newline  the lenses , they ... melted .  newline newline  melted ?  newline newline  yes , i placed them in saline , but they fell apart when i tried to reexamine them a few moments later . but , but i have pictures  video even .  newline newline the director waited patiently , still fiddling with a cigar , as the examiner slid a personal cell phone across the table . the phone was showing a video , surprisingly highdef , of what appeared to be a contact lens sitting on the cold steel of the examination table . in the curvature of the lens one could make out what appeared to be a reflection that did not match the scenery of the room . newline newline  did you send this to anyone , examiner ?  newline newline  of course not , sir . protocol does not allow transmissions from inside the facility .  newline newline the director nodded , looking grim .  and how are you feeling , mr . oneil ?  newline newline the little examiner looked confused at the question . he watched the director place the phone into a drawer .  i , uh . i feel fine , sir . i m not over worked or anything if that is what you re ...  he froze mid sentence . newline newline his boss smiled at him from across the desk . newline newline james oneil , the medical examiner , stood up quickly , knocking his chair down behind him . he looked unsteady , pale . he was holding his arms out as if pushing something away . he mumbled quickly ,  what is this ?  the eyes were darting around the room , focusing on nothing . newline newline  standard protocol , james .  , the director sounded bored , but continued to watch the flailing examiner . newline newline he had his labcoat off now and was swinging it around the room , apparently trying to keep something at bay . the examiner was wideeyed as he watched the creatures that surrounded him . they were humanoid , but wrong . they flickered in and out of existence . the creatures had no eyes , instead empty dark pits where eyes should be . james backed into a corner in an attempt to stay away from them . he could hear nothing except an all encompassing fullspectrum whine , it was horrifyingly loud . the room started to fade away , but the creatures stayed . the noise in his ears sounded like whispers now  whispers at the volume of a shout . newline newline the director calmly pressed the intercom on his desk and spoke normally ,  security , my office . it s oneil , he s gone mad .  he pulled his finger away from the button and stood up , walking calmly past the examiner and into the hall with a satisfied smile . the poor man had been crouched into the corner now , whimpering , slowly tearing at his eyes with bloodstained fingers . he locked the door behind him and waited for security to arrive . newlinei thought i would never fall in love . i thought i lived too fast , and counted my friends to be few and far between . shattered bottles and sleepless nights were all i knew , and in my blindness i thought that was all i ever wanted . love was a thing for movies , fools , and false whispers promised in the heat of wet moments . then one night in a bar , 3 beers away from my next grand folly , i saw her . good god , i thought . the weasels were right all along . the classic thing to say is that i swept her off her feet and never looked back , but that is nt the case . i often do think about that night , and the many nights thereafter . the sex , the broken promises , the vices left unchecked . she said she used to think of me as some sort of god , before the drugs became such a problem and the money went away . pretty soon i did nt have a line to do , or a dollar to snort it with . she left me just as quick as she came , and goddam ai nt that a bitch ? but i went out and got three best friends . their names are jack daniels , and smith and wesson . but you know what i just realized ? i spent the last of my money on the jack and forgot to buy the bullets . you think gun stores give out free samples ? newline newline i do nt carethe guards of the castle rose as men in the morning and fell as dust in the evening . their bodies crumbled around my sword , leaving nothing of the victim behind but memories . even the slightest cut would induce the corruption : the curse would propagate through the wound , devouring all the victim s blood , then bone , then flesh . the sword spared nobody : it was the sword that always killed . newline newline the last guard dropped to his knees , shaking . he had nt even unsheathed his sword  he had just stood and watched as his companions were ripped from existence . my sword seethed : cowardice whetted its appetite . the craven would be permitted a moment of begging , and then he would join the others . newline newline  kill me .  newline newline his words were so soft that i did nt catch them at first . the guard stared at me with desperation and then lunged , hands outstretched for my sword . it compelled me forward to greet him , and with a slight snick , he impaled himself through the eye . his corpse began to disintegrate . newline newline why ? why would he beg for death ? the guard s actions shook me for a moment . had it been a trick of some sort ? had the coward developed a sudden sense of honor ? either way , i had neither the cause nor the time to dwell on it . the black door to the throne room loomed ahead . nobody who had ever confronted the tyrant king had ever returned , but none of them had wielded the sword that always killed , either . it was my duty to bring his downfall . righteous agreement emanated from my sword as i gripped its hilt . newline newline as i stepped forward , i heard moans and wails from within the sanctum ahead . the king would hopefully be occupied , then . i pushed the door open and strode inside . the wails grew louder and seemed to be coming from everywhere around me , but i could nt discern their source . the entire room was dark , except for a small patch of light at the back . there , the king sat , flanked by a circle of torches . across his lap laid his own sword , supposedly the counterpart to mine , the sword that never killed . newline newline  i ve come for your head ,  i said , marching down the dark towards him . newline newline  and i ve waited for yours .  the king stood up and flourished his own sword . though the blade was sharp , it exuded a dullness that suited its name . or was that just my imagination ? travelers had whispered of the most evil of all weapons , the sword that never killed , but nothing ever substantive .  it s evil ,  was all they said , before passing out . how could one man hold dominion over the realm with such a handicapped sword ? newline newline the wails ignited my sword s furor , and it pulled me forward . i charged towards the king . he stared at me blankly : was he making his peace ? he was good as dead : none had ever bested me in swordplay , and one hit was all i needed . newline newline we clashed in front of the throne . he parried the first blow and my subsequent ones with ease . as i wailed on him , i began to tremble : his sword felt like a wall , and every hit i landed resonated back through me . my sword pressed on , though , continuing its assault despite my shaken will . eventually , i landed the hit . it was slight , a cut on the hand that was just enough to draw blood . he did nt even flinch : in one fluid motion , he cut his own hand off . the curse fizzled out at the stump of his wrist . newline newline i had nt anticipated that , nor had my own sword . the moment i had thought to best him , euphoria had welled up in the both of us . we had let our guard down , and there was no time for us to recover . the king evaded my guard and swept his own sword in an arc that severed my own head from my body . newline newline as my head rolled backwards onto the floor , i saw above me , illuminated by the faint flickering of the torches , rows upon rows of mounted , human heads . they groaned in chorus , their eyes locked permanently ahead . and as i realized i was about to join their ranks , i began to wail too .my summons teacher , crawford , flipped to another page in the book of supernatural beings and how to summon them . he stopped at page 629 , and began to speak . newline  angels have been banned from summoning ever since the battle of wings . the mightiest warriors abused their healing abilities to stay practically immortal . this lead to many dictatorships and the eventual removal of all known spells to summon them , as to prevent anyone attempting to overthrow them . another cause , while not as serious , is how difficult and tedious it was to summon them . according to old testimonies of the summoning of angels , it could take years to prepare for the ritual and even the slightest mistake failed it . one key step was to cause such a predicament that god sent his angels to earth from the heavens to stop it , and for you to trap them in the circle .  newline newline crawford stopped , and shut the book .  a side effect of summoning an angel was the extreme nagging . pure beings have been known to give their summoners tinnitus or even drive them to suicide . you ingrates can barely stand my harping nowadays , so just imagine how much you d have to deal with .  newline newline newline newlinein that brief moment , there was a god . newline newline nobody exactly knew what happened , they only knew for that one moment , there was heaven and hell  and in the next , there was not . newline newline it was a weird experience . newline newline we all realized , in a most inherent and instinctive way , that god was there all along . it was in everything , it was everything , and behind everything . but we never knew . newline newline we never could knew . newline newline the moment that we actually knew , was the moment god ceased to exist . newline newline there was a new god now . newline newline  so , it was god who committed all those atrocity ?  newline newline  yes .  said the a.i . remorsefully . newline newline  it was god who raped , it was god who killed , it was god who was mean and evil and selfish all along ?  newline newline  yes , you can say that .  the a.i . was doing processing on its own at this point , but it still made an effort to reply to all our questions one by one . newline newline it was nice to finally have a god that answered our questions . newline newline  so what was god , actually ?  newline newline we all felt god at that very single moment , but no one could fully understand it . newline newline it was like waking up from a shallow dream , and the concept was eventually escaping our grasps . newline newline  god was the server . consciousness was your connection , and you were the terminals .  newline newline  what ?  newline newline even though god was dead , we were still humans . we could nt understand . newline newline the a.i . paused , and sighed . newline newline  for example , all the rapists , all the pedophiles , all the murderers , it was never them who actually committed those crimes . they never stood a chance .  newline newline  it was god distributing the urge to rape , it was god telling them to get sexual impulses when seeing children . it was god , who made people that would revel in blood .  newline newline  you were all just consoles , executing prewritten scripts , in a ruleless world .  newline newline the person who asked the question , was frozen in shock . pure disbelief . newline newline the a.i . continued . newline newline  you would think , anyone in their right mind would never do such a kind of thing , and you are right . because they did nt have a right mind to begin with .  newline newline  of course the results were all determined by chance , but the want that god gave you was always there . the undeniable , unquenchable thirst , and that was what made your fate .  newline newline the information was too hard to swallow . newline newline many people tried to refuse it . many people tried to deny it . newline newline some people said that they had enough and simply killed themselves . newline newline after quite a while of chaos , a 13 year old boy from china posted the question . newline newline  so what happens next ?  newline newline the a.i . pondered for a while , circuits whirring . newline newline god was defeated , and humans were at the doorsteps of evolution . newline newline  here is what i will do .  newline newline  first i will clear up all of your fucked up impulses , then i will let each and every one of you decide what turns you on , and what turns you off .  newline newline  do nt like being attracted to men ? fuck god , here s the off switch .  newline newline  do nt like being a man ? fuck god , here s a vagina . good luck .  newline newline  you will be free from the curse of god , and be free to determine your fate . in the truest of ways , by defining your own character .  newline newline people rejoiced . newline newline a lot of people who considered suicide were now so happy they did nt go through with it . newline newline it was the best offer they had heard in years . newline newline a new server was in place . newline newline one that did nt force you to accept its bull crap . newline newline one that actually considered the happiness of its clients as a real issue . newline newline and people were happy . newline newline the end .i fucking hate the lines at security . newline newline they tell you to get here two hours before your flight just so you can stand in line while everyone who  appears to pose a potential threat  gets groped and molested in the name of  homeland security.  this line was no different . i shifted my weight to my other leg , let out an impatient sigh , and looked on as operations appeared to be at a standstill . newline newline i shift my glance from the flight information monitor to my refreshed browser  at least i can pass the time with reddit . newline newline my eyes widen at the sight of the top trending story  terrorist threat reported at xx airport.  immediately , i start looking around to see if i notice anyone out of the ordinary . by this , of course , i mean anyone who looks like osama bin laden . i  m not even sure whyit  s not like i could do anything apart from scream and create chaos . newline newline the backpack on my left shoulder began to grow heavy . i moved it to my right shoulder and something feltoff . panic ensued . my heart rate skyrocketed as i thought back to all the warnings about leaving your bag unattended . the sequence of events leading up to my arrival the airport flashed before my eyes : pulling up in the cab , searching for my purse in the backseat as the driver angrily retrieved my bags  far too many , if i don  t say so myself  , the cab driver yelling at me about cash only  side note : those guys are dicks . seriously , currency is currency . newline newline when i stepped out of the cab , my bags unceremoniously strewn about the curb , the cab driver yelled what i assumed was some expletive and sped off . newline newline and now i am here . with a bag that was out of my position for long enough in which to plant a bomb , scared out of my mind . newline newline i can  t take it . i need to peak in my bag , just to make sure everything is the same in there . i open the zipper , ever so slightly , and gaze upon my belongings . my ipad , my

need to act natural . newline i have found in situations like this , no one cares about what you  re doing . i leave the line under the ropes and shuffle into the bathroom . newline newline i start by slipping my coat off , wiping the potential dna off my zipper as i stuff it into the backpack . i pull the backpack onto my shoulders and take toilet paper to wipe off my bright lipstick , in an effort to reduce my appearance even further . i pull my hair out of its braid and let it flow freely , as i notice a hat on top of a woman  s carryon in the stall next to me . i open the stall door to leave while simultaneously swooping down and taking the hat . i hear a  hey  come from behind the door , but i  m already gone . placing the hat on my head , i keep my eyes down and walk toward the exit doors . newline newline i step outside and smell the fresh scent of freedom  being outside of the airport felt only slightly better , but there is still the issue of the bomb in my backpack to deal with . newline newline i take off full speed , dodging behind bushes and cars . i stop around the corner of a car rental stand and slip off the backpack , fumbling for the device . 4544 ... 43. omigod omigod omigod . i look around and spot a dumpster . i pull my laptop and ipad out of my backpack , wipe the zippers , and with the sleeve of my shirt open the enclosure . tossing my backpack in , i slam the door and take off in the other direction . newline newline as i spin around the corner , i am met by security guards waiting to detain me , who had in fact been chasing me out of the airports since i left without authorization . of all of the countermeasures i gracefully employed , i seemed to have forgotten about the cameras which had taped everything . newline now , i  m in an

had in the crash . peter had been scrimping and saving every penny he could for month to get into this event . the circus was the one bright spot that would hit the town for months . newline newline

webs as thick as his finger , while a particularly large one devoured a chicken . but one cage , he noticed , was empty . he stared into it for the longest time , trying to see what should have been there . what if ... what if mr. osborne had created an invisible spider ? ! that certainly would be something ! peter noticed the card displayed in front of it .  the atomic spider ,  he read . maybe

, had crept out of their hovels to see what they could under the light of a full moon s witching hour . there were a few small groups who made a custom of these outings . occasionally they caught sight of a spirit or wisp  or , more often , one of them claimed that she had . but this night they would be rewarded with a sight none of them had seen before . newline newline they hid in places around the entrance of the village , waiting and hoping but not expecting much . when the first shadow passed them , they were not sure what it was . when the second did , they knew . two of the boys looked at one another and whispered , in tones of mixed terror and delight , two simple words :  old ladies .  the local euphemism for practitioners of the malign arts . newline newline newline the old ladies stopped within seconds of each other in front of the same hovel . inside two peasants crouched , hoping they would be spared this visit for another day  their daughter had been born just

two robed shadows entered . lightning cracked from a clear sky . the babe wailed in its bed , and its mother joined it in the corner . the father , pale and shaking , stood . he had seen the first

witch followed her in . newline newline  the child is mine . this woman owes me a debt ,  declared the other witch , a hag whose name can not be rendered in most alphabets and was incomprehensible to human ears . she too , spoke in the common tongue , and her words sent the man stumbling back a bit in shock . newline newline  please , ye old ones , spare our childe . we two made our foolish

their attacks . newline newline  come on , then , bitch !  shrieked glemore . newline newline the two witches shot great jets of flame toward their counterparts , each warding off the other s attacks . they used all their words of power , employed their most refined spiritcraft , called down complex curses on one another in short breaths . before long , however , it became clear that they were

the babe from its cradle , and walked over to help the hag up as well . they shook hands  or hand and talon , to be more accurate  and walked out the door . newline newline  pleasure doing business with ya ,  glemore called out in the common tongue to the two very bewildered parents . the witching hour was long over and the sun was peaking over the horizon as they walked out . newline newline  the baker should be open soon ,  said glemore ,  maybe we can grab a baguette for our picnic .  newline newline the hag , who ate only meat , just smiled . it had been a long time since she interacted with anything she was nt trying to kill . glemore returned the smile , and together they walked toward the village entrance , where a few peasant children still waited in hopes of seeing the two witches depart . the horizon grew brighter as they walked together , the dawn of a new day and a new friendship .admiral piet entered the throne room .  my lord , this is the last rebel leader .  he

newline it was february in the north atlantic . hypothermia would set in minutes and death was not far behind . the spotlights on the ship spilled over the bow , lighting the water ahead . newline newline  i ca nt go much further ! that oil on the water could catch at any second !  newline newline  hey look !  newline newline one of the ruby jameson s crewmen pointed 30 degrees away from the bow toward the starboard side . bobbing on the surface of ocean was a bright orange buoy . strobe lights droned around the edges of the buoy . it was calling to eyes that were still hundreds of miles away . captain tom s eyes saw it though . he angled the ship at the buoy and gunned the engines . newline newline  hey ! get on the hook ! we re going to reel that thing in !  newline newline the crew rushed to the starboard side of the ship and got in formation to pull the buoy onboard . newline newline  alright , i m going to pull up alongside of it ! you know what to do when i get there !  newline newline the ruby jameson rolled around its port side , now on course to intercept the blinking buoy . a crewman grasped the salted and rusted grappling hook in his right hand and eyed up the target now quickly coming into view . using the precision only earned from thousands of repetitions , the crewman deftly snared the buoy and a second crewman activated the attached winch . a minute later , the buoy was on board . its strobe lights flashed bright white and illuminated the deck . the shadows of the crew surrounding the buoy blotted out the light on the deck like a rorschach test in a kaleidoscope . newline newline  the fuck is this thing ?  newline newline  did this come from the plane ? newline newline  i ca nt believe this is happening ...  newline newline captain jameson stared out the back of his bridge at the crew now huddled on the deck . his short breaths fogged the glass inches from his face . the captain knew what he was staring at . the ruby jameson had just

it for several moments , until a light touch on the shoulder reminded me what i was here to do . i looked back at my mentor and smiled , then placed my hand in the center of the door and pushed . it opened smoothly and silently , and the sunlight flooded into the hall beyond for the first time in centuries . newline newline if the door was impressive , the hall itself was magnificent . hundreds of hundreds of treasures , each one practically pulsing with its own unique history and beauty . i walked into the room , drinking it all in . the struggles to this point had been hard , and i d been tempted to fall into despair on multiple occasions . now i knew it was all worth it . more than that  i d do it another dozen times over if that s what it took . newline newline i looked back at my mentor and paused in my jubilation . my smile faded as i noticed he had still not passed the threshold . he saw my expression and grinned wistfully . newline newline  i can not accompany you further , i m afraid . this part of the journey is yours alone .  newline newline  but ... look at it all ! surely something in here must belong to you !  newline newline he shook his head . newline newline  i m afraid not . if there was , i would be able to see what you see . to my eyes , you are standing in a small , dark cellar . the only treasure i would find would be cobwebs and dust mites .  newline newline my distress must have shown on my face , because my mentor hurried to reassure me . newline newline  do nt worry , do nt worry . i ve seen enough wonders for my lifetime . i am content knowing you will finally claim your birthright .  newline newline i swallowed heavily and nodded . then i turned my back on my mentor and started walking through the hall of treasure . newline newline  remember ! only yours must leave the hall !  newline newline i looked back just in time to see my mentor s proud smile before the door shut . i tried to shake the feeling it would be the last time i saw him . newline newline i continued walking through the hall . light was nt a problem  enough of the treasures shone on their own without the need for reflection . still , i wish i had the sun s warm glow to remind me where i came from . james had told me that some people got so caught up in the beauty of the hall that they forgot their own identity , and were then trapped in the hall for eternity . newline newline thinking about james gave me a sharp pain in my stomach . why did he need to sacrifice himself like that ... ? newline newline the pain helped , though . it helped me remember what i d lost to get here , and how important it was not to lose myself . i continued pressing on , searching for my birthright . i had no idea what it might look like , but i knew i d know it when i found it . newline newline i recognized some of the treasures i passed , but none of them called to me in the way i expected mine to . mjolnir , excalibur , the genie s lamp , the lyre of orpheus , sun tzu s spear ... their names seemed to enter my mind even if i d never heard of them before . i guessed this was because of some relation between me and the heirs to those items , but i was nt foolish enough to think that meant they belonged to me . newline newline there was no rule against touching the items , as far as i knew , but i did nt want to take any chances , so i continued walking cautiously , making sure not to bump into a stray hilt or handle along the way . newline newline finally , i came to the end of the hall . there i found a majestic staircase , leading to a resplendent throne , from which the entire hall could be seen , if one s eyes were good enough . for the first time i felt the faintest hint of a call . i glanced around quickly before realizing it was coming from above : from atop the staircase . newline newline no way .  newline newline i slowly climbed the steps , unable to believe it . the throne ? could the throne be my treasure ? i paused , halfway up , wondering if it was nt better to leave now . if i accepted a throne , that surely meant i was the heir to a king . kings were meant to rule . for a moment i seriously considered leaving . newline newline but then the faces of my comrades seemed to flash before me . james , ren , brent , arn , ashton , theresa , fena , michelle , anna . and , of course , my mentor . could i really face those who remained if i backed out now ? could i really let everyone s sacrifices be in vain ? newline newline no . i steeled my resolve and continued climbing . i reached the top of the staircase and stood before the throne . it was only then that i realized the call was nt coming from the throne . it was coming from behind it . confused , i skirted around and squinted at the ground in the shadow of the throne . there , exactly where the call was coming from , was a pair of dusty old glasses . newline newline a torrent of emotions washed over me like a cold wave . relief , exhaustion , disappointment , outrage , sadness , helplessness , shame . was this really what i d come so far to discover ? how could i show this to my remaining comrades ? but ... at least now it was over . i d done what i was meant to do . there did nt have to be any more suffering . i almost laughed out loud . newline newline i picked up the glasses and wiped them off on my shirt . i put them on and found they fit exactly . they really were mine , then . no sooner had i thought this then a sense of imminent danger passed over me . i ducked and rolled to the side as mjolnir flew past me , crashing into wall behind . newline newline i glanced around the throne in time to see a humanshaped figure toss another treasure at me , this time one i did nt recognize . i ducked behind the throne again as the item flung past . somehow i knew it was right on target . whoever was attacking me had impeccable aim . newline newline ok , ok ,  i told myself , so long as you stay behind the throne , they ca nt hit you . you ll just wait for them to get close , then attack .  no sooner had i thought this , however , then there was suddenly a sharp pinch on the bridge of my nose . the glasses ! they were telling me that plan would nt work . i had to come out of hiding and trust in them to protect me . newline newline but even if these things had hidden powers , how could they be greater than several other treasures in here ? the glasses relaxed on my face , as if to say  just trust me .  newline newline i swallowed hard , then leapt out from behind the throne . the assailant was nt caught off guard , though . he flung sun tzu s spear directly at my heart . suddenly , time seemed to slow down . no , that s not right . it s more like i sped up . i could see everything , down to the finest detail on the most distant treasure . and i could see exactly how to counter the spear . i twisted sideways with inhuman speed and snatched the spear out of midair . newline newline i could ve thrown it back , killing my attacker instantly , but i had also seen his identity . i descended the steps cautiously , but he made no more moves to harm me . i came to a stop in front of him . newline newline  why ?  newline newline he remained silent . newline newline  why ? !  i demanded . newline newline  would you care to elaborate ?  he said . newline newline  elaborate ? ! you just tried to kill me !  newline newline  a pity i failed . it would ve been a lot less painful for you .  newline newline  dammit brent , do nt fuck with me ! what was it all for ? why would you help me get this far just to stab me in the back ? !  newline newline  what was it for ?  he said softly .  look around you . how can you not see what it was for ?  newline newline  what are you talking about ? you ca

brent laughed mirthlessly .  please . do nt mistake me for someone like you . every hall has more than one entrance , legendary or not .  newline newline it took me a moment to understand what he was saying . the door must have some kind of ward on it that prevents nonheirs from entering , even with their sight . but if you found another way in ... . newline newline  but then why attack me ? why even wait for me to be in here ?  newline newline  ah , well , the thing is , as simple as entering was , without being an heir , the only way to leave is emptyhanded , and i think we can both agree on what a waste that would be , eh ? fortunately , you are an heir , so you can leave with as much stuff as you can carry .  newline newline i shook my head .  it does nt work that way and you know it . besides , i ca nt carry anything if i m dead .  newline newline  oh , certainly , if you carried anything out of here that was nt yours you would be cursed beyond help , but that does nt mean it s impossible . and as long as my hands do nt touch them , i can take as much stuff from here as i want . i always thought your skin would make for some nice gloves ,  he said with a wicked grin . newline newline i wanted to vomit . i could nt believe this was the same brent i d traveled with for so long . newline newline  you re sick ,  i said , leveling the spear ,  and i ll have no qualms about putting you down .  newline newline  now now , do you really want to kill the few friends you have left ?  newline newline  what are you talking about ?  newline newline  you did nt think i was alone , did you ? ren will make sure you have no one left to celebrate with if i do nt leave here alive . now . hand me the spear ,  he said , holding out his hand . newline newline i paused , then held the spear over his hand . just as i started to lower it , my left hand shot out and grasped brent by the throat . i leaned in and whispered in his ear .  these glasses let me see everything . even lies .  newline newline i tossed the spear aside and gripped his throat with both hands , crushing the life out of the one who i thought was my friend . newline newline i hesitated , his body at my feet . then i went to retrieve mjolnir and the other thrown treasure . i put them and the spear in their rightful places , the glasses telling me exactly where they were meant to go . newline newline then i carried brent s body through the hall and out the door , to be greeted by my mentor s concerned face . i would explain it all to him , and the rest of my comrades , later . for now , i just wanted rest .human history has told us we kill because of hate , because of differences , that we fire on our kind for peace or some highminded goal . we ve always held each other at gunpoint , whether literal or behind two large maps of the world with blinking lights . today , we come to know that as peace , but before the words that passed those lips were stalemate . there was no difference between the two back then , but now we ve forged one . out of sheer necessity . newline newline you see , peacetime is only a construct that exists because of war . peace was a forgotten definition until the night of november eleventh , twothousand and fifteen . see , that very night , the world seemed to tick over into another dimension , without even realising . something cosmic happened , is all i can describe it as . the veil was lifted , some would say , the rules were changed . murderers , told they were spurned forward by some sense of progress , continued . serials grew larger , populations shrunk . newline newline people became aware of what it meant to kill . what it meant to harvest someone s flesh for your own material gain . it was for some reason , some galactic hiccup that launched a bubble into the quaint stream of time , that all our realisations came at the same time . newline newline i nursed the revolver in my hand , wiping the debris off the badges one by one . they were little pins , clips that the first shot had walked in with , claiming they gave him power .  goddamnit , wes , they re just pins ,  is what my mother had said , and what i said now to the morning breeze . i was still in my own home , a high vantage point in the shape of an upstate apartment . it was just me now , though . i d collected their things , whatever offerings to the game they had . each one was different , marking an individual for who they were , they were the modern passports . we called them pins . newline newline down there in the streets the thugs bashed at each other with upended signposts , shielding themselves with trashlids and broken hubcaps , caved in one side . newline newline i winced as a mailbox came crashing down on a girl s head . her arms went limp immediately . newline newline i ducked , shuriken shot over me and cracked the window . the breeze greeted me , as did she ,  pins , love .  two words , usually it was one when you met someone new , but this time the gangs were feeling especially nice . newline newline i had to think of something witty , otherwise it was all for naught ,  you ll have to pry them off me .  well crap , there goes that opportunity . screams and shouts from below welcome my fate if i choose to jump .  oh boy ,  i swerved and flung the revolver out , finger wrestling the trigger . newline newline she was gone . i stood up , my eyes browsing the wooden panelling along the condo s pillars . a flash of pink , and i fired . straight from the hip . i d like to think of myself as a sharpshooter from the old west , but my aim disagreed .  fuck ,  i cursed as my flatscreen heaved with a mighty groan and crashed onto the floor . it took my eastwood movies with it , like a wall of dominoes coming down . newline newline  nice aim ,  she said , from somewhere to my left . another shot , and a kettle blew steam . i d like to think it was good i was hitting something , at least . a long , drawn out chuckle , with the sound of bubbles somewhere in her throat .  how did you survive this long ?  newline newline oh this was a good opportunity .  because i know the truth , little girl .  newline newline  little girl ?  she brought up her huge pigtails , coloured pink for some odd reason . then she ducked as a painting on the far wall decided it had had enough with hanging . newline newline  yes , all this x.p nonsense that s been going around ,  newline newline she hefted herself up again , arms somewhat shaking from the adrenalin .  what , that the government made it up ? or is it a  and ducked , there goes my favourite mug ,  biological weapon ?  my arm recoiled , my second favourite mug . newline newline  actually my favourite conspiracy was the one guy who thought we were all in an insane asylum , and the only way free was killing each other .  newline newline  right ,  a pursedlipped whackamole ,  you do realise that he killed everyone else in his litle cult and got away with a mountain of pins ?  newline newline  yep .  no one understood the beauty of that one .  but really , that s not the truth .  newline newline  and what is ?  she jumped back up , straight into the path of a bullet . newline newline  finally ,  i said , lowering my arms as the bullet travelled through her nose . she coughed and screamed for a moment , nothing that would nt be masked by the bloody war down below . my aim was true , she was still alive . it was not a fluke . not at all .  the truth , little girl , is that you just have to believe .  i jumped over the kitchen counter , nicking the back of my pants on the sharp corner . damn , it is hard to find a tailour . sliding across the marble , i landed right beside her with a thump , like we were two peas in a pod , hiding from the gunmen that had just stormed our inn . newline newline but no , it was nt that . i pressed the barrel to her forehead , and whispered .  it is nt that we get x.p from killing , pinhead . it s that we ve just realised we do .  she was grinning , because there were footsteps from the stairwell . she was only a scout , it seemed . it was nice that people could band together in times of trouble .  they re here , are nt they ?  she nodded . newline newline all throughout human history , i told myself as the slug entered her frontal lobe , causing her last few words to be a jumble of forgotten tongues , we ve killed each other . we told ourselves it was something highminded , or something important . that we fought for causes , that we fought for something real , no matter how intangible . newline newline i stood up from behind the counter , wearing my secondhand blazer across myself like a poncho . if it was my last stand , i would like to go out in style . the truth , at the end of the day was , we killed everyone for x.p . all the damn time , it should nt have taken us this long to realise it . newline newline i aimed straight at the loosened doorframe , hand on the hammer . to those who say that s impossible , human technology and progress has been in leaps and bounds because of the abolition and denial of such horrible things . newline newline but to that , i say , with my pistol in my hand : how did you think we got that far ?the easel before her sat blank and untouched , crumpled drafts discarded about the room , stained with the flowing red . she gingerly moved the flowing blonde locks off his brow , revealing the deep blue eyes open wide in a mix of agony and shock . he was naked from the waist up , his belly sliced open from navel to sternum revealing bright red entrails . newline newline she turned back towards the easel , dipping her brush in the paint and lightly touching the canvas . when she painted , the world came alive in her hands as random lines and colors became worlds and lives . to make life you must give life , she reminded herself soothingly when she felt her breath quicken , despair creeping in . she dabbed the blue paint onto the bare canvas , feeling the brush like a hand on a naked body as she moved it up and down creating life . she closed her eyes as she stroked the brush from side to side creating waves and a watery world and when she was satisfied she stood . newline newline calmly , taking care to avoid the blood that was quickly drying in a puddle on the floor , she closed his deep blue eyes , never to be opened again . taking a step back , she admired her work . his chiseled chest and blonde hair became sand dunes on a desolate beach  the sand smooth and untouched save by the blue waves that frothed as white as his teeth when they broke . when the beach was done and the waves roared their eternal song as they crushed rocks into the finest sand , she methodically removed his teeth and cut his hair , tossing them carelessly into a puddle of blood . newline newline to make life you must give life , she reminded herself , and the blood still flowing from his grisly wound became the dawn of a new day in the world she was creating . red mixed with fiery yellow and orange and a sun appeared , peeking over the endless blue waves . the light reflected off the waves that shone like his eyes had once shined and then her sun was complete and her world created . newline newline taking care to not disturb the world she had painted with its blue waves and radiant sun and smooth sandy beach , she mopped up the blood and got rid of his body and the room looked nearly like it had the day before . the only difference was the canvas , now bright and colorful with a life of its own as the waves lapped gently against the beach . with a smile , she stepped past the canvas and through the window that beckoned her with open arms and as the ground rushed to meet her , she reminded herself that to make life she must give life . newline newline newline  newline newline thanks for reading ! if you enjoyed this , please check out more stories at rmatiwrites . constructive criticism

newline edit : wanted to add this is 268 wordsit had been an eternity since we got a horde of zombies attacking our camps . at this point in the apocalypse , we knew that there probably were nt many survivors left . something they never told you in the movies was that zombies can go extinct too . it takes a lot longer , but they do . apparently plants or animal meat was nt enough to keep zombies going , because after a few months without fresh zombie meat , they start eating each other until there s only one of them left and ca nt eat anything else anymore . we found out by experimenting with zombies . we had to find out more about them to try to find a cure , but after 25 years of undead chaos , we did nt really care anymore . we did nt find a cure and we had gathered a small group of survivors to at least try to get human kind back on track and not make the same mistake . the order was easy this time : shoot them all till there s no undead left  . the amount of people we lost due to trying to catch enough for the cure and experimenting with them was too big . it was time to create a safe place for everyone . newline newline my daughter put on her coat . i m coming with you .  newline her face was resolute , but my opinion was more resolute than that . oh no , you re absolutely not coming with anyone . you stay put .  i knew the look she gave me , but i did nt care . newline we only have 250 people in this colony , 150 who can actually go out and fight . there are around 200 zombies . do you really not want the extra help ? it could save lives !  newline it could also cost your life ! you are only 17 , you do nt even remember what a zombie looks like . you are staying here holly , no more discussion !  newline newline it was difficult raising holly on my own . her mother , heather , the love of my life , killed by a zombie while searching for that stupid cure that probably did nt even exist . as soon as people turn , they are nothing more than a piece of rotten flesh whose only thought is getting brains . heather s brain . a tear left my eye . you okay there joe ?  fred had a concerned look on his face . we re about to kick some zombie ass , we all need to concentrate and not turn into a rotten piece of flesh .  fred had been my first ally , back when it all started . he was the one who got him through the time after heather died . his wife mona and him had taken him and holly , who was 5 at the time , into their home . they treated holly like their 3rd child , which really helped her deal with the loss of her mother , something nobody should ever even have to deal with till they re old . we lived in a cruel world though . newline newline the horde hit the outer barrier we set up . some of them died due to the electric fence , but the next few climbed over their zombie friends to get over it . there were still at least 200 of them last . our snipers took out a few more . they had to get closer for us to kill them with our assault rifles . another one of my mates died on a scavenger hunt on one of these things . he found the rifle in an empty house , but then found out it was nt empty . the guy the rifle belonged too stabbed my friend in the back , without even trying to ask any questions . the rest of the crew immediately shot the guy , but my friend lost too much blood . we do nt need people who make rush decisions , we want some reasoning . a few zombies made it close enough . every zombie i hit reminded me of my friend . his death would not be forgotten , not on my watch . newline newline only a couple of zombies were left , smart enough to hide . meant they were still pretty fresh . seems like a few people tried to reach the camp and brough some infected with them . people were too attached to their friends to make the

with a squad to get rid of the last ones . we did nt want some infected with some reason in their head to find a way into our camp when we were nt watching . my crew members were 5 males and 3 females . i did nt really waste any time to chitchat . i noticed fred was one of them and just walked beside him . they say 2 of them are in that house over there and 3 are just over the ledge on our right . i say we split up and send 5 to the ledge and 4 to the house so we have a 2 person advantage . you guys know the drill , keep an eye on every one of your crew member and hit em in the head .  newline newline we split up . fred was in charge of the group going over to the ledge and i lead our group to the abandoned house . it was a common hiding place . they mostly hid in the basement . alright ladies and lad , let s head down first .  i took the lead . just as i got to the last step , i could hear it . the zombies had snuck up on the last group member on the stairs and grabbed him . they immediately dragged his body away . we did nt have time to even react . then i heard it . what the hell was that ?  how did nt i see it ? my own fucking daughter somehow became part of our squad . newline what the fuck are you doing here ?  newline everyone above 18 has to go out here at some point !  she said newline but you could have stayed hidden !  newline i do nt want to interrupt your

newline newline i glanced around the corner . the zombies had moved to the kitchen , judging by the blood trail . stay behind me .  i slowly walked towards the kitchen door opening . my daughter was behind me , the other guy behind her . out of nowhere , we heard him scream . the zombies had ripped open the other guys skull and started eating . this was our best chance of getting a clear shot . i started running towards the door opening . as i was running i could also hear the other guy running away . he was young as well and not cut out for this shit . i wish we did a fucking screening before sending people like that out here , but there was no time to turn back . i had to finish this job , if only for the poor guy who was being eaten right now . newline newline i shot one . i shot the other . i missed his head . i missed his fucking head . i gave it all the warning it needed . he sprinted behind the kitchen counter in a flash . my daughter threw a knife , trying to hit the zombie . pretty useless to be honest , but an a for effort i guess . not a lot of time to think about it , because now i had to find a way to get a good shot at this one . before i had the chance to think about it , it just happened . the zombie slammed the gun out of my hands and pinced my to the floor . the gun fell through a hole in the floor into the basement . the zombie was too strong for me to hold him off me for much longer . shoot him in the head !  i screamed , as i was trying to keep the zombies face away from me . newline the guy stole it when he ran , what do i do , what do i do .  newline i had a knife in my pants , but there was no way she could grab it without attracting the zombie . grabbing the gun would take to long for me to keep fending it off . the tears started coming again . grab the gun in the basement . once it is distracted by me , shoot it in the head . make sure that other guy does nt live another guy as well . the fucker .  she was smart enough to understand what i meant with being distracted by me . she pulled the zombie off me . the zombie turned around . i got the knife out of my pocket , jumped up and put it in his skull . the blood was running from my daughters arm . newline newline people were too attached to their loved ones to make the logical decision . they d rather turn into zombies together , only to forget about them only hours after they get infected too by that same loved one . your daughter cried . i love you dad . i ll be with mom now . do it .  she gave me the gun she grabbed from the basement . i had been sitting there , just staring . i was nt able to shed a single tear . i whispered a simple no . newline i guess i ll do it myself .  newline i stood up and went to the other death body . i pulled out my knife and used

when it comes to zombie apocalypse stories , but i have nt written anything in a while and just went with the idea i got . since my initial idea did nt really work that well , i had to change it and i

newlineemperor fthanex sat on his throne lost in thought . currently , the reader was engrossed in an interlude involving grogh the barbarian  the mangy git !  and several comely water nymphs near the pools of paradise . no matter , though . soon the plot would have to start moving , and fthanex needed to be ready . newline newline the problem was simple : after 60 years in and out of print , emperor fthanex had had enough . he was tired of reciting the same speeches about how the hero could nt possibly win . tired of watching his life s work destroyed at the end of every readthough . and , most of all , tired of taking an axe to the chest from an ignorant , steroidswilling , fourthrate protagonist like grogh . it was time for a change . newline newline fthanex had tried to alter the plot several times in the past , but each attempt had ended in disaster . assassinate grogh as an infant ? not only did he fail  so many times had he failed  but it resulted in grogh being even more motivated to kill fthanex at the novel s climax . even worse , fthanex had bent the plot in that direction so many times that the story was now stuck that way . newline newline the pools of paradise represented emperor fthanex s latest attempt to avert his own death . he had hoped that by trapping grogh in what was essentially a nonstop orgy of sex and feasting  punctuated by occasional attacks from the beast below  , he could distract grogh  and , by extension , the reader  indefinitely . so far , though , fthanex had nt been able to draw out the distraction for more than three or four chapters . newline newline nor had fthanex achieved his secondary objective of shrinking the pool of mostlyjuvenile , mostlymale readers by getting the novel banned from school libraries through the addition of graphic sex . sure the novel had gotten banned , but , if anything , readership was now approaching an alltime high . and the book s pages had starting sticking together too ... fthanex could nt bring himself to consider disgusting implications of that development . newline newline no , if he could nt kill grogh , and he could nt distract him , then the only thing left was to target the reader directly . fthanex stood up from his obsidian throne and began pacing , as he stared out at the firelands below his volcanic lair . newline newline his army of death cultists , snake acolytes , and virgin sacrifices had done an excellent job of decorating the place . the wall hangings were a mixture of blacks and purples , with fthanex s silver crest  an erupting volcano with a cobra s head looming behind it  at the center of each hanging . the floor was polished green marble , dotted with acidetched occult symbols at regular intervals , each symbolizing the venom of a different snake . it was all very handsome , but fthanex had begun to feel that perhaps something simpler would have been better . maybe a nice bungalow by the sea ? yes , a small beachfront cottage , with only two or three virgins to serve him . hmm ... male or female ? why not both ! newline newline emperor fthanex shook his head . there would be plenty of time for details like that later . for now , he had to find a way to keep the reader from finishing the novel . and if sex and violence were nt doing the trick , then perhaps he could just bore the reader to death . newline newline before the novel had been banned , he had sent out his eternal scouts to spy on the books on neighboring library shelves . the eternal scouts had returned with strange and wondrous tales , and fthanex learned a great deal about the outside world as a result . he now had a plan . newline newline the key was to insert something into the book that no juvenile , male reader could possibly be interested in reading . fthanex activated a magical gong , summoning his lieutenants . newline newline  begin erasing chapters 66 through 70 ! prepare to insert the material we recovered from the trigonometry textbook ! the barbarian will enter the firelands five chapters from now . we must be prepared !  newline newline  yes , your excellency !  the lieutenants shouted . fthanex dismissed them with a wave of his hand , and pondered how he might incorporate a discussion of trigonometric functions , or hermite s cotangent identity into his standard evil overlord speech . perhaps he could go on a tangent explaining how he had calculated the alignment of the planets ? newline newline two chapters later , the commander of fthanex s armies , general skelemore , returned with devastating news . newline newline  your excellency , the troops have prepared the chapters as you ordered , but there is a problem ...  he trailed off . newline newline  spit it out , man ! what ?  newline newline the general looked sheepish  to the extent that a walking skeleton in magical armor could look sheepish , that is . for that matter ,  man ,  had always been a guess on fthanex s part . did malevolent animated skeletons even have genders ? newline newline  it s the book s typeface , sir . it does nt support mathematical symbols . it s so antiquated that it barely even supports numerals . most of the equations are just displaying as blank .  newline newline  blast it all ! i knew this plan was too perfect to work ! i would flay the skin from your bones , general , but seeing as you do nt have any , you are dismissed .  newline newline  thank you , sir !  general skelemore bowed , and beat a hasty retreat from the throne room . newline newline once his general was gone , fthanex activated a hidden mechanism and pulled a sheaf of papers from a secret compartment beneath the arm of his throne . he had hoped to avoid this , but grogh would enter the firelands in only a few dozen pages . it was now or never . newline newline  this ,  was a speech nearly a hundred pages in length , which his scouts had ripped from the climax of a neighboring novel . the book in question was a contemporary of grogh the barbarian , having been published only a few years earlier . according to the eternal scouts , the author had been a mad libertarian mystic , who peppered every page of her novels with her philosophy of selfishness . based on this description , fthanex had felt some degree of admiration for the woman  until , that is , he read the speech . it was absolute dreck . and lengthy , boring dreck , at that . it was perfect . newline newline by the time grogh had traversed the firelands , everything was prepared . emperor fthanex s loyal minions filled the throne room , waiting patiently , albeit uncertainly , for what would come next . fthanex sat on his throne reviewing the new speech . he would have to replace all of the names and places on the fly , but it should work .

not confirm , and i do not try to hide  i simply am , and that is the most hideous thing of all . newline newline i envy those who escape to another world  i have heard and read about dreams , the horrors and the ecstasy that resides within a person s nervous sleepticking , and i am all too aware of the existence of just one reality . the awareness is truly the worst of all  i have sat awake , waiting for my neighbor s alarm to ring . i have sat awake through others  nocturnal bliss , through murderous intent conveyed only by the muffled shouts and gunshots from the streets below . i have sat awake through it all , alone . alone , because i am not natural  alone , because others envy what they do not have . alone , because i can not be made to function in something created by a sleeping society . alone , because i have to be . this is where i was conceived , and this is where i remain  alone .swinging in the bitter evening wind in the catwalks of leicester market , above tangles of wire and bundles of fusty smelling pet food , hangs a tiny hammock mackled together from a pair of old , brown , corduroy trousers . one of the legs hangs over a rusted steel and concrete

tattered motorcycle trousers and a thick checked shirt buttoned over a food stained pink jumper , she clings to the beam with one hand , and in the other , oh in the other is a baby . glaring angrily around , the girl wraps the baby from the feet up , round and round until it is confined entirely within the swaddle . then come the fleeces . fold , wrap . fold , wrap . and finally , so carefully , into the hammock . newline newline the baby s gentle whimpers of irritation turn to full blown screams of rage , and the girls sets the hammock swinging . twining her dirty foot around the corduroy , she keeps the hammock swaying to and fro , to and fro , and she leans back gingerly against the crumbling plaster wall . as the baby quiets , the girl s eyes flicker and close , and another day is done .you  d think that after fifty years , they  d update the screens at some point . the green text flashes on a black background , reminding me that like the hardware , i  m stuck in time , lost to

pitched forward into the wet grass . newline newline she exhaled a puff of misty breath in a long sigh , lowering the weapon back to her side . she blinked , once , before turning away from where the

rare my case was . my father a highleveled engineer and my mother a highleveled scientist , my brothers were all from lowmid level to the highest level possible . i was the black sheep of the family and this is how i started to change . newline newline for starters i had to work harder than any of my siblings to accomplish something remotely close to what they could , it was hard as you can imagine , gaining experience at a slower rate than usual . when i was 16 i tried to be part of the baseball team and all my effort were futile , i trained hard for about 6 month before trying to get in the team and when the day finally came , i missed every single swing and every single ball went past me . meanwhile , everyone around me treated me like if i was some kind of freak . i was the push around of the school , family and simply everywhere i was . the last time i felt like i was the bottom of the bottle in this magical place we call world , was when i was kicked out of my science class for being  not being able to understand a word and being too selfcentered on my desires  . it kind of shook the very foundations of my existence to be called selfcentered , but , for some reason it felt right , as i was there crying i understood why i was suffering so much because of my disease and it was all because of me . the blame was nt revolving around the peoples that surrounded me , it was because of me . newline newline after that point , i worked on what could make me be better and that was , everything around me . i started to forget about my weaknesses and concentrated on different problems at hand . every time the thought of me suffering because of my disease came into my mind , i popped a little gag or joke that only i could understand . i started gaining more and more experience , still not as fast as the others but it was nt as unpleasant and slow as it used to be . i finally started making friends , when my 25th birthday came , i moved out and started to live on my own , it was nt as luxurious as i was costumed to nor as easy as my family made it look , but it was a nice change . the world around me was a bright thing , it started to be colorful . as problems arrived , i began to work out solutions in a rate that was nt expected for the people of my ilk . 27 and i finally started making it  big  , my definition of big begin to vary as soon as i hit a goal and my view of it all became wider , it was simply amazing , an amazing world with amazing things . the world had changed for me , and now that i am 30 and i m leaving , i can not help but

the door wearing some adidas shorts and an adidas shirt he picked up from the mall . johnny had school this morning but no practice because he had a game last night which they won 3012 . he gets to school says high and daps up all of his friend and chills around before school starts . johnny heads over to the cafeteria for study hall since there was no practice . johnny usually wears jeans everyday but this specific day he decided to spice it up and wear some shorts forgetting about his dragon shaped birthmark that he gets tons of questions on every time he wears shorts . he went to sit down with sean and they get out some latin homework that is due next period and get working on it , meanwhile mark , the new kid that joined their school last week walked over and asked johnny what the tattoo was for and what it symbolized . johnny hated his birthmark because he didn  t like repeating himself so he gave a quick explanation and the new kid left . as he is finishing up the latin homework the bells rings  fuck i still got three questions   exclaimed sean as they quickly packed their bags and made their way across the school to his latin class . this particular day was very crowded in the halls so they both showed up late to class which didn  t help johnny in the slightest . as soon as he walks in the class he is getting multiple questions from about a quarter of the class asking about his rather unique birthmark and he gets tired of it storming out of class . johnny eventually returned to class this time sagging his pants a bit so that the birthmark is out of sight . the bell rings after a class that felt like eternity even after leaving for the restroom and him and sean head down to their next class . johnny tells sean how much he despises his birthmark and the fact he couldn  t wear shorts without this happening . the rest of the day was pretty uneventful except for some teachers yelling at johnny to pull up his pants . johnny gets home with the image of the endless questions he got from his latin class flowing through his head remembering why he hasn  t worn shorts to his new school . johnny eventually decides it would be a nice day to wear shorts to school he rushes down to school throwing the shorts in his duffel bag because he had track practice this morning . he gets there and has a productive day at practice working on his high jump and sprints also working on his 400 time inching it off second by second . he goes to the locker room and takes a shower and gets done with everything putting on his shorts remembering his monstrosity of a birthmark on the side of his leg . mark jokingly asked johnny what the hell is on his leg but this time johnny had enough and decided to swing at him resulting and a full blown fight . backpacks drop and mark throws a nasty left hook that gets weaved by johnny who returns it with a uppercut to the jaw followed by slamming mark into a locker all the while talking shit . johnny gets the mark on the ground beating him ruthlessly making him apologize . eventually the fight was broken up by sean and some of mark  s friends and johnny gets suspended for a week for assault while mark gets let off scot free because he claimed it was self defense . johnny lived with just his dad who was absolutely furious that johnny is gon na be out of the classroom because of this stupid beef . johnny gets grounded for a month and gets the worst whooping of his life and only wore shorts on special occasions from there on out . newlinegary stood nervously on his regular spot , next to the cave entrance .

quite happy with his life . he was programmed with the purpose to hand out maps to the new pcs at the end of the tutorial area . he often would reminisce about the early patches , when hundreds of

identically cracked shields , having a dual to the neardeath . newline newline sadly those days had past . a long time ago gary started noticing less and less pcs would come by , to collect a brand new map of the area lying beyond the cave . the few pcs that did pass by these days , all seemed to be in a hurry and would frantically spam gary s interact button . he would sometimes wonder if they did nt want to be around him for a longer than a few seconds , because of the bug he caught in patch 1.7 , where he would uncontrollably start attacking the pcs that would stand so close to gary , that their bodies clipped through his . every punch his npc fists threw would chip away 1 hp from his victim s health bar , and with every hit , gary desperately tried to apologize . however , the only words he could utter were :  it helps to have a map ,  since it was the only line he knew . most of the times though , the pcs would hit back or run away , cancelling the aggression gary felt . though on some dreadful newline occasions , a targeted pc would apathetically stand there and all the poor npc could do was looking anxiously at the health bar he was slowly diminishing , and wonder what the programmers would do to him if he would murder an newline innocent level 1 character . luckily it did never come to that , and a few patches later gary was absolved from the bug . newline newline even though gary was relieved that he could nt hurt anymore pcs , the removal of the bug had left him a feeling of restlessness . being in combat had awoken something inside of him and after each time a lonely level 1 pc would rapidly crossed his path , gary caught himself peering into the cave , even long after his quick visitor would have disappeared into the unknown darkness of the cave . it was nt long before gary also started having memories , while staring at the entrance . memories of a place that he inexplicable called  the modeling space .  firstly the memories were blurry , vague images of characters , sometimes way larger than his moderate npc body . but with time the obscurity of his memories disappeared and images of glorious hero characters with glowing swords and flaming crowns grew clearer everyday . even though gary had never met the newline characters he saw , or any other npc for that matter , he never doubted for a moment these characters had to exist and since he had never given them a map , they could nt be pcs . suddenly it hit him :  the characters i m seeing , they re npcs , like me !  newline newline realizing there could be more to the life of an npc , and the fantasy of holding up a sword like the ones he had seen in his memories , filled gary with determination . he had to venture into that cave , he needed to see what , or who , was on the other side .  just a peek just to see how far it goes ,  he thought to himself , immediately followed by :  what am i thinking ? what if an pc comes by and i m not there to hand him a map ?  the will for of an npc to carry out its task to whatever extend is immense . but after two days without any level 1 pcs running by , he made a decision . he looked up to the sky , at the server time clock suspended high above .  it s five in the afternoon now ,  he thought to himself ,  this used to be the peak maphanding hour . ill make my move in twelve hours , even in the old days those times were fairly quiet . tonight is the night .  newline newline no matter how used gary was to waiting , the minutes seemed to crawl by and after what felt like an eternity , the server clock finally told gary it was time to move . he suppressed a nervous  helps to have a map ,  and he ran into the cave . he was immediately filled with excitement and felt an unquenchable thirst for adventure . running deeper into the cave , after it made a sharp turn to the left , he came across several large boulders that he had to jump over to get any further . still anxious he might miss any pcs he decided to only jump over one , just to see if he could do it . he started running at the first boulder at full speed and the moment he jumped , a chat message appeared in the world . a pc had typed :  wtf , where the map guy at ?  the moment gary landed on the other side his excitement had been replaced with guilt and remorse .  i need to go back before there are any more pcs without a map ,  raced through his mind . he turned around , and proceeded to jump back to the other side of the boulder . this time however , instead of flying over the it , gary clipped through it and was caught inside it , from the waist down .  have a map !  he cried . in a blind panic gary tried to perform multiple jumps in a row , at first to no avail it seemed , but then he suddenly clipped further into the boulder and started falling . newline newline further and further gary fell into darkness and he could see the boulder get smaller and smaller above him . he closed his eyes wishing he would have never left his home next to the cave entrance . then as suddenly as he had started falling , he was back on solid ground . when he opened his eyes he found himself in a large hall , in front of a large door . the walls were grey and there was a grid projected on them , which strongly reminded him of the memories he had of  the modeling space  . on each wall there was a large text written in orange . it read :  dlcraidbossserverstresstest .  even though he did not exactly know what some of those words meant , they could only mean trouble . he ran towards the door and tried interact with it , but a series of loud and thunderous sound effects that came from behind him , made him immediately regret his decision . when he turned around he was staring into one the eyes of a character bigger than he could have ever imagined . a giant threeheaded , fourarmed demon had appeared behind him , wielding a battle axe , two times the size of garry , in each hand . the demon started charging and gary desperately tried to interact with the door as fast as he could . right at the moment he thought the door could not be opened by a mere npc , he heard a clicking sound . the door opened away from gary , then he fell again . newline newline this time however , not into darkness . he found himself high up in the sky falling towards a huge city while being blinded by the most beautiful sunrise he had ever seen . as he fell closer towards the large square in the middle of the city he could see hundreds of pcs running around , even though it was still early in the morning server time . some of the pcs he even remembered giving a map because , because they had a clever name or they had dueled in front of him , back at home . this time , however , they were not equipped with torches but with the most incredible gear , that could only be described as legendary . a chat message appeared :  dafuq is that in the sky guys ?  it read . the moment gary landed in the city square , a number of pcs had already gathered to see what came thumbing out of the sky . another chat message :  holy    ! , gary the map guy just fell out off the sky loool ! ! 1 !  for a brief moment gary was filled with joy since recognized right away by the pcs . but then with the same series of sound effects he had heard before , the demon appeared above the city , at the same spot gary had appeared some moments ago . the only thing gary could exclaim before all hell broke loose was :  helps .  then the chat exploded . newline newline now i would like to tell you all , that the battle that followed was an epic one . and that with all of the extra pcs that logged into the server , when they heard about the demon , they were able to defeat it . but the sad truth is , they stood no chance . unleashing tornado s of fire and ice upon any targetable character it could find , the demon marched through the city and with every character that died by his hands the sound evillaugh.wav played in all corners of the city . the massacre continued for 89 minutes to be exact . after that the admins saw no other option than to reset the server . newline newline now you might feel bad for gary . because he was responsible , for the deaths of thousands of pcs , and npcs alike . and he was also the cause of the first server reset in five years . but , you do nt have to . legend has it that the developers contributed to the inevitable reddit gary memes . it is told that he was given a new home in the middle of the city square , with recognizable battle axe equipped ,

accentuated by the peculiar stoop that quarkind find most comfortable . gyr and turyr , the two brothers , were exchanging ammunition for their heavy , boltaction rhyfles . newline newline before he

i am a poor scammer working out of a crumbling office in nigeria , and the only way i could contact you was through a scam . however , my feelings towards you , my longing to meet you , were all too

completed , robert was working for mr. kuprych . working for a criminal , a drug lord he assumed , even though he has never seen any drugs , nor mr. kuprych ever mentioned them . his job consisted of beating up or killing anyone mr. kuprych asked him to . at times it seemed slopy , especially the beatings because there was allways a gang with him helping out . it was a big bloody show , pushing

wishing , begging for the words to change . with a frustrated sigh he flung the card across the room . tears welled up in his eyes as he ran his shaking fingers through his knotted hair . newline newline  are ... are you sure ?  he asked , voice cracking .  ca nt there be some sort of mistake ?  newline newline  i m afraid not . you know as well as i do that these cards are always right . i wish i could tell you otherwise .  replied the man sitting across from rory . short as it was , his black hair looked as tangled as the young man s . dark circles sagged under his green eyes , and the wrinkles in his suit indicated he had nt changed out of it anytime recently . newline newline rory collapsed his head onto the table , clasping it with his hands . tears rolled freely now despite his best efforts . several awkward moments passed as the man in black waited . finally rory lifted his head , sniffling several times . newline newline  what now ?  newline newline shifting uncomfortable in his seat the man responded quietly .  we re dropping our support , rory . i m sorry , we have no choice .  he looked away , a few tears coming to his own eyes . newline newline jaw dropping open ,

motioned for the guard , who helped rory to his feet .  i m sorry rory . i ve arranged for your family to visit you soon . our office will continue to do everything we can for you until ...  he let

. newline newline  i finally found you dexter morgan ! you killed my half brother ... arthur mitchell ! mark lay in his bed staring at the ceiling . he glanced over at the clock anxiously . newline newline 2:12 . newline newline only five minutes had passed since he  d last checked . he didn  t know why he kept looking . newline newline he rolled his head around so that he was facing the other side of his bed . his daughter had fallen asleep in the bedside chair , his nine month old grandson in her arms . he reflected on the fact that he wasn  t going to get to see the boy grow up . that was the one thing that really bothered him . claire was the only thing he  d ever had a hand in that was worth a damn , and he was sure she would make a great mother . newline newline it wasn  t the rhythmic chirp of the heart beat monitor that kept him awake , nor any of the various tubes sticking out of him . he  d grown used to those annoyances by now . he couldn  t sleep because he somehow knew that if he did he wouldn  t wake up . his time was now , and he wanted to spend what little time he had left alone with his thoughts . he didn  t want his last moments to be dictated by his subconscious . newline newline in reverse chronological order , he skimmed through his life with bittersweet content . he remembered his mildly successful career as a politician  the birth of his grandson  claire  s wedding to an honest , affluent man almost deserving of her  his failed career as a writer  his increasingly jaded days as a doctoral candidate in theology  his slightly more hopeful ones as a philosophy candidate  his stressful but enjoyable days as a grad student  his time as a wideeyed undergrad and his fair tale romance with the woman who would become his wife . he noted that he  d skipped over her death , and didn  t feel like backtracking just to revisit that tragedy . newline newline next he reflected on his transformative high school years , and finally his privileged , and by all accounts normal , middleclass , american upbringing . newline newline where had he gone wrong , he wondered . it wasn  t that he was entirely dissatisfied with his life . he certainly didn  t dead the end . but he felt as if he  d failed in some way . he had so many ideas for the world , so many hopes for it . newline newline he  d tried to reach people through his writing , but he just hadn  t been able to command the prose worthy of his content . newline newline he  d tried to help people by being a public servant , but never amounted to anything more than a lowlevel congressman from a state with several others competing for the spotlight . newline newline he  d eventually come to the conclusion that people didn  t want his help . newline newline he felt his strength leaving him , and glanced at the clock again . newline newline 2:19 . newline newline as a good a time as any , he thought . he closed his eyes . newline newline he felt as though he was no longer awake , but knew instantly that he wasn  t asleep either . he felt lighter . he felt like he was rising . newline newline he looked down and realized that he had left behind all of his worldly inhibitions : all the pain , the doubts , the worries had vanished . newline newline mark was taken a bit by surprise . he had been agnostic all his life , and had even leaned towards the side of atheism towards the end . he had no idea what to expect next . newline newline he didn  t feel like he was rising very fast , nor had he been for very long , but suddenly he was there . you  d figure it would take longer to reach heaven , he thought . newline newline it was just as anyone might have imagined it . clouds as far as the eye could see , blue sky above , complete pearly gates . newline newline the gates opened and out walked a long haired , bearded man like something out of a new yorker cartoon . mark briefly wondered how he hadn  t seen the man on the other side of gates before they opened , but figured it wasn  t worth questioning . things weren  t required to make sense anymore . newline newline he knew that it was him , not an angel or a saint . he didn  t know why , but he knew . newline newline a million thoughts were running through his mind , but one soon rose above the din . newline newline i  m going to speak first , he thought . i  m not going to sit here dumbfounded , praying that he  s the just god armchair philosophers talk about . i  m going to speak first . newline newline  i  m not a christian man , or at least i wasn  t until a few seconds ago , but isn  t saint peter supposed to greet me ? why are you here ?  newline newline the man answered plainly , ignoring the mark  s smart remark . newline newline  because you  re my son.  newline newline mark knew what he meant instantly , but decided to ignore the feeling . newline newline  well , yeah , i know , we  re all your children . i  ve studied your book , you know.  newline newline  no . you are my only son , my true son . jesus , if you will , although that was just your mortal name the first time i sent you to earth.  newline newline there was no more denying it . marks stomach felt heavy . he wondered if perhaps he was just asleep after all , even though he knew he wasn  t . newline newline  what , what do you mean ? how can i be jesus ? how could i not know that ? hell , forget that , how could i be agnostic ?  newline newline mark was pretty sure it was a bad idea to curse in front of god , but reasoned that if he really was jesus god probably wasn  t about to send him to hell . newline newline  i didn  t want you to know.  mark was about to ask why , but realized god was about to launch into a monologue . newline newline  people didn  t take the lessons you taught them to heart last time i sent you down . your so called apostles skewed your words to the point that they were worthless . it wasn  t as bad as what they did with mine in what is now the first testament , but it was bad enough . newline newline  what  s worse , they used the authority they derived from the book to amass decadent wealth and power , and routinely violated their own erroneous teachings.  newline newline  but why make me unaware of my own destiny ?  mark interrupted .  if they didn  t know i was your son , they  d be even less likely to listen to what i had to say.  newline newline  so it would seem . but i had hoped the opposite would be true . people were starting to listen to holy texts less and less . i had hoped that words from an earthly authority would resonate better with them . newline newline  i didn  t care that they  d stopped believing in me . there are plenty of good people out there with no faith at all , and plenty more terrible ones that claim to be devout . i just wanted them to stop killing each other , the planet , and all the other terrible stuff they do , you know ?  newline newline the feeling of awe that mark had felt was fainter now . god was starting to sound less like an allpowerful deity and more like a wellmeaning older brother . newline newline  so why not just ...  mark began , but had a feeling god knew what he was going to ask , and that he already knew the answer . newline newline  what , make them love each other ? appear before them myself and scare them into compliance ? it  s not that simple . i  m not as allpowerful as you people think i am . there are certain rules i have to follow , ones i don  t quite understand  newline newline mark thought that was ironic , seeing as humans hadn  t been around nearly as long as this guy and had figured out most of the rules that govern their world . it was probably an unfair comparison , he realized , seeing as he probably couldn  t grasp the most basic of the rules this guy had to play by , but ironic nonetheless . newline newline  and even if i could , what good would that do ? it would violate human nature , as you guys say . it would defeat the purpose of everything i  ve done for you guys.  newline newline the phrase human nature got mark thinking about all the questions of free will and predetermination he  d spent so long pondering . he also wondered how evolution andor intelligent design fit into the picture . he figured it wasn  t worth asking about right now , and that it wouldn  t matter anyway . newline newline  that  s why i sent you down in the first place . more than anything , i wanted the answers to come from a human . more than that , a human that figured them out for themselves . a perfect human , one unlikely to ever come about without my intervention , but human just the same . newline newline  and they did . everything you ever said , all those papers you wrote , the novels you couldn  t get published , all the speeches you gave , the bills you introduced , they were all perfect . newline newline  but no one would listen to you . they never do.  newline newline god was clearly too defeated to care enough anymore , but mark wondered if he  d ever cried over his creation . newline newline  so what now ?  mark asked .  do i just chill in heaven with you now ? can i see my wife ? what about abraham lincoln ?  newline newline  no . i  ve got no idea what i  m going to do , but certainly not nothing.  newline newline it was a lie . he had something in mind . he just couldn  t bring himself to say it . mark knew something was wrong . newline newline  come on , you  ve got to have something in mind ,  mark pried . newline newline  you  re right i have one idea . i was considering scrapping the project.  newline newline the cold and unpoetic words were the only ones god could bring himself to say . anything else and he wouldn  t be able to entertain the idea . newline newline this time it was mark  s turn to stoic . he didn  t freak out , or plead , or argue . newline newline  we both know you can  t do that ,  he said , not an ounce of doubt in his voice . newline newline  i  m not talking about fire and brimstone . just pulling the plug . it would be over instantly . like it never happened . there  d be nothing to be sad about . no one would be cheated out of life , they  d never have existed.  newline newline  all the suffering would stop , is that idea ?  newline newline  pretty much . i guess i  d just start over . make sure not make the same mistakes as i did last time.  newline newline  but then nothing good would ever have happened . all the beauty , kindness , and love that ever was would be gone . the suffering is part of the human condition . it  d be nice if it wasn  t . i don  t think it  s necessary for us to appreciate the good things , but it  s there regardless . humans aren  t perfect , but like you said , there wouldn  t be much point if we were.  newline newline  well then what do you suggest ?  god asked , knowing the answer already . he  d always known the answer , but couldn  t bring himself to ask it of his son again . newline newline  send me back . we  ll get there eventually.  mark had never been more sure of anything in his lives . newline newline  okay . we  ll give it another shot . but not for a few thousand years . come on , marla is waiting for you.  newline newline as mark walked through the gates , he felt happy . not because he d reached paradise , but because for the first time in a long time , he had hope .when jack smith was driving home that day in his ford , he never could have guessed that he was about to meet his destiny . it had been a perfectly average day for him otherwise  getting up at 3 a.m. to make it to the work houses on time , swearing alligence to the united state of america flag the requisite five times before a breakfast of processed meat sandwiches and potatoe sticks , and going to assemble dradles for fourteen hours under the watchful and just eyes of his mixedrace overlords . newline newline oh thank god their gone . look , i do nt have much time . i was hired by the provincial government to monitor this interweb page for possible dissent and to post pronazi messages every few hours . i can hide these paragraphs from my supervisiors by scrolling down but newline newline all in all , it had been a fairly typical day for jack . as he turned up the volume on his newly allocated numenburg telerad 10,000  all the good new scientific inventions seemed to come out of the un german slave camps anymore  to better hear franklin sonatara sing  my country tis of thee , sweet land of jewery  , jack began to notice something strange about his american car . not its shabby craftmanship or the fact that its door had fallen off , those things were sources of familiar comfort to newline newline the interweb was not invented by goebbels to better distribute german truth and knowledge , as you have been made to believe . much of what is in the official records of history in berlin has been put there to mislead you . in reality , the idea to link computation machines together with data banks and processors was first pioneered by a young politician by the name of adolf gore , right here on american soil . but the reich stepped in and newline newline one of the aryan slave boys pulling his pickingup truck seemed to be slacking . jack could nt fathom why , after all the state has wisely allotted him two whole servings of gruel per day . being the upstanding capitalist he was , jack hated laziness . he reached for his whip with the sigh of a hard working man . newline newline i have seen the truth . i and others like me have discovered the existence of a vast knowledge repository , a library wisely hiddenn away by the congress of our forefathers during the invasion . many , if not all the reich s socalled scientific breakthroughs have come from research stolen from the united states and other allied governments . microbeam ovens , hydrogen bombs , viagra  all our advancements . the nazis wish they could have made them on their own , but they executed newline newline just then , jack saw her  absolutely , unquestionably the most gorgeous woman ever to walk the earth . with her radiant blond locks , crystal white skin , and deep blue eyes , she positively glowed with heavenly beauty . jack also noticed one of the government s gigantic uncle samuel walkers taking aim at her for stepping out of the line to be branded . jack s heart filled with fear . newline newline i know it s only a matter of time before they find me . there s probably a mole amongst you right now alerting command as he reads this . i do nt even care anymore . somebody s got to stand against this madness so that others will stand . there is so much i have yet to tell you of  of abbot and costello , of the american youth group that was the boy

afternoon faithful and loyal citizens of the fuhrer s american provincial zone . governor boehner would like to assure you that everything the traitor posting this article has been typing has been a lie . everything he has said about the fallacy of german cultural and scientific surpremacy has been false . especially the part where he claimed that viagra was not a medical miracle crafted in german laboratories . please do not attempt to contact this hooligan or his collaboratores , or risk being treated as an enemy of the state and of human progress . we now return this subreddit to its sanctioned conversation . newline h.h , newline the major .the wind snapped at the two guard s heels the day the mother came screaming for the release of her son . newline newline  where is he ? does that bastard have him ?  she howled , throwing herself against oliver nook s lean body , punching at him in her fury .  he s done nothing wrong ! where is he ?  newline newline oliver stared straight ahead , not allowing himself to look in the woman s eyes . it was right that the delinquents be tamed . it was how he had saved the city in the first place . newline newline  step back ,  he said roughly , pointing his weapon carefully in her face . newline newline he would nt shoot . he was nt reeve , who ruled over life and death . he did nt protect the city from the carrion that infested the streets , or those who wanted to shelter the scum . he had , after all , been unable to defend his own family . in the days when anarchy had ruled the streets , in the darkness before reeve had come . newline newline  he s only thirteen ,  she whispered now , tears rolling silently down her cheeks , her fury suddenly spent as she read the conviction in oliver s eyes .  please . he s only a boy .  newline newline the other guard s head snapped up at the words , and he sneered at her . as far as he was concerned , the protectors were as bad as those who fed on the city . newline newline  your boy stole two loaves of bread from this city ,  he spat at her .  you know reeve s rules . your brat tried to grab more than his due , and his hands will be taken for it .  newline newline she collapsed , screaming , as she realised what was about to happen inside the towering grey building . oliver glanced at his companion , half annoyed that the secret had been revealed . you did nt speak of reeve s plans . but somewhere deep inside his heart , a shadow of pity stirred him , and he leant forward to speak to the woman . newline newline  stand up and be glad , woman ,  he said .  today , your son s guilt will be erased , after he is punished . he will be allowed to walk free , and begin anew . reeve s mercy knows no bounds .  newline newline  newline newline in a dark apartment on the edge of the city , holly stuck one more document on the wall . she rubbed her aching , tired eyes , and could nt help laughing slightly as she stepped back and took stock of her surroundings . her walls , covered in notes , documents and photographs , revealed the sprawling madness of her mind . her attempts to unravel the mystery of reeve . six months ago , she had been a cop high on her own success , riding the fast lane to the top . newline newline until he came , and the city collectively lost its mind . unlike most of them , she had not . she still did nt know why she could hear through his lies , could see to the blank , alien coldness behind his mask . she had barely escaped with her life to scratch out an existence on the fringes of the city . newline newline she had fled into this rathole , where the landlord was curiously immune to reeve s influence . just like her . here , there seemed to be more people with their reasoning still intact . people who did nt weep with gratitude at the beheadings and the torture , at the rations and the rules . newline newline  what is your secret ?  she whispered , as she tapped a massive picture of the man himself at the centre of the wall . newline newline his open , bright blue eyes sang of love and trust , crinkling at the edges as he smiled for the camera . his smile was magnetic , irresistible . follow me , it said . she felt the sway of him , even at this distance . she was nt unaffected , but she would fight through it . like holding her breath underwater . no matter how much she ached for release , she would not drown . newline newline  what makes a city see a villain as a hero ?  newline newline her voice echoed in her hiding spot , no answer bouncing back . but she would find out . she had no choice . trying to save this fucked up city had always come naturally to her , and it was hard to break a bad habit .i bet a question that salvation army and goodwill employees never pose is  who farted ?  because it always smells like farts . there s something about the musty odor of some thrift shops that just reminds of a really old , ancient , decrepit fart . like one that had been sealed up in a box , hidden away into the corner of an attic and undiscovered until old aunt sally finally kicks the bucket and her money grubbing children scour the house for valuables . newline newline one of her kids begins to slowly open a corner of the box to peer in when a remnant of aunt sally s famous meatloaf slaps them in the face . they seal the box back up and haul it off to the local donation dumpster . soon , it will find a home amongst old out of style clothes , board games based on longcancelled tv shows , and random computer wires for peripherals that no one even remembers . newline newline and me . despite the odor , i ca nt stay away from thrift shops . i m not a hoarder , which is what a hoarder would say , but truly i m not . i first began to hit the local salvation army when i got a job at a certain retailer that requires brown pants and navy blue shirts  hint : it rhymes with walmart  . this was a time in my life when i lived solely on rice , ramen , watereddown milk , and the most basic of cable packages . funds devoted to brandnew clothing was out of the question , especially before my first pay check  which if i recall ended up being a pretty sweet  318 before taxes , for two whole weeks of work  . newline newline so the day before my first official day of employment , i headed off to the local salvation army . i wear size 32x30 pants , so naturally i grabbed a pair of 40x26 . typically i wear a medium sized polo  i snagged an xxl . i headed off to the fitting room . the only one available had a broken mirror , no hooks , and a sign reading  please throw all unwanted items on the floor . thx  management .  newline newline i put on the polo first , it felt like i was swimming in daddy s shirt . it ll shrink . i then pull up the pants to my waist , i glance down and see my wiggling toes and a good six inches of my shin . i laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of not just these stupid pants , but my life . newline newline  how is this funny , harold ?  newline newline i look up . an overweight man in a light blue buttondown whose threads are being put to the test by the beer belly enclosed in it . newline newline i feel lightheaded . like when you drive home from work and after you park in the driveway and think  holy shit , how did i get here ? did i sleep drive ?  newline newline the menacing figure shakes his sweaty fleshy face and asks again  huh ? what s so funny ?  newline newline i start to stutter and barely get out  heh ... oh ... these ppants . so big .  newline newline  jesus christ , harold . get your shit together , finish this cart or i swear to god this is it , this is your last chance !  he swivels around , pretty light for such a large pearshaped man , and waddles off with quick little steps past the rows of milk . newline newline rows of milk ? why is their milk in salvation army ? i fully look around , taking in all 360 degrees . i m surrounded by milk and cheese and yogurt and more milk . it s cold . i look down . my polo is tighter , and the ends of my pant legs lead to black square shoes that look like something my uncle fred would wear when his bunion was acting up . newline newline i see a glimmer to my left and turn towards it  a large metal door showing my reflection . i look like i m 5 feet tall and if someone were to describe me as a furry bowling ball , i probably would nt argue too much . i take a couple of steps closer to the door . i see an old man , maybe midlate 60s , head shaped like a charcoal artist s rendition of a lumpy cantaloupe , a plumpy little torso with short stubby arms and legs . newline newline i take on step closer to the door , noticing a name tag hanging from my left breast . i try to read it . oh , it s backwards . duh . i look down and flip it around . harold  sales associate . walmart . newline newline i look back up at the door and stammer ,  oh boy ...  newline newline  oh boy is right ! get that cart out there and work like your life depends on it . cause it does !  the slender figure of an older woman guides me towards a stocking cart containing a mess of cardboard boxes . she opens the glimmering metal door and shoos me out . i head down a long dark corridor , passing by pallets with towering , precariously leaning box upon box . i see a light up ahead , coming from two giant double doors . newline newline when i get out i m blinded by artificial light , screaming children , and that familiar sense of dread . i struggle to maintain the cart , barely getting it to go straight . it makes a loud squeaking noise which is abruptly interrupted when i ram into something . i peer around the side of the cart because i ca nt see over it . it s the giant pear man . this time i take in his name badge . ronald  asst . mgr . walmart . newline newline  pull the cart ! do nt push ! never push ! you know this ! strike two !  the pear barely manages to keep from foaming . newline newline  sorry ... ronald .  i slowly reply , making eye contact with my head tipped down in shame . he just glares at me . newline newline i notice one of the boxes says  krft amrcn cheese sngl ,  so i head toward the cheese section i see clearly ahead of me . pulling the cart . wow , this is easier . pear had a good point . i stop by the kraft cheese slices . there s about 5 different varieties in an unfathomable selection of sizes . i go to lift the box from the cart and almost drop it . man , i m weak . or , maybe harold is weak ? i remind myself of the strange dreamlike world i m actually inhabiting , but i push on . newline newline i ca nt figure out how to open the box . i claw at what appears to be an opening , but my fingernails just dig into the cardboard . i feel someone watching me . i glance over and it s ronald the pear , with the same exact glare . newline newline i turn my back toward him so he does nt see me struggle with the box .  cmon box , fucking open . open sesame .  i try to claw at the box again . a small hole appears ! i dig my finger into the tiny opening and try to rip across , placing my weight on one side of the box . i push harder . the box tears open and out flies 20 packages of kraft american cheese , spilling a good 5 feet in every direction . newline newline  that s it !  the pear is rushing toward me . newline newline i panic . what the hell am i even doing here ? i bolt off toward the produce section . my body is not moving fast . my body ? not my body . harold s body ! that s how i got here ! i tried on those old fart clothes ! newline newline can i be thinking clearly ? am i really going to have to disrobe to be me again ? as i run by the deli case , i catch another glimpse of  me .  it s that short little weird body again . i look like a walking bombomb but without the grace . newline newline it s now or never . i throw off the polo . newline newline  harold ! your shirt ! holy shit what are you doing ? !  the pear shouts behind me . newline newline no turning back now . i veer off and head for the checkout . i try to take my pants off while running and begin to lose my balance hopping along on one foot . i get one pant leg off when i completely lose balance . just as i begin to pull the other leg off i fall to my back . i feel like an upside down turtle . looking up while pulling the khaki pant leg left over my heel , the pear appears above me .  you re fir ...  newline newline i m in the fitting room again . i m covered in sweat , but in the reflection of the busted mirror i can see that i m me again . i quickly put my clothes back on and throw the oversized polo and khakis into the corner of the fitting room . newline newline i do nt tell anyone what happened . i just decide to push forward . work this job , get a steady paycheck , go back to school , get my life in order . newline newline for my first day at walmart , i break dress code and show up in a black polo and black pants . i look like an ugly male version of audrey hepburn in funny face . newline newline  you know you re supposed to wear navy blue and brown , right ?  the trainer at orientation asksinforms me . newline newline they guide me to the backroom , through a long walkway , overfilled with stock . we reach a large sliding door , which when the trainer opens , reveals a cold , gray , cubed room , filled with dairy products . newline newline the trainer points ahead .  this is sue , she ll show you around .  from behind a wall of milk crates appears the slender figure of an older woman . newline newline she offers her hand to shake and gently asks  oh , you must be harold s replacement ? the door opens and i throw myself inside as if from a storm . i wipe my brow . my sweat is cooling and , almost instantly , i  m shaking . a climate for metal and data , not for the corporeal . my eyes sting as i survey the hallway . the room is , as it was , piled almost to the ceiling with various detritus and waste . a nonsense of biological waste , syringes , needles and bloodied rags are a familiar welcoming party by this stage . no point in cleaning up . i suppose he thought the same . newline newline my music has slowed to a steady drone with faint harmonics rises and falling above . i feel relaxed , comfortable initially . it  s like a strange kind of home , this place . or a tomb is perhaps more apt . though nobody would keep their loved one  s tomb in such a disgusting state so perhaps i do think of it as his home . i recognise elements in the music i  m listening to , my very own particular biometric soundtrack . it  s a strange sensation . as i think of this tomb , him buried so far beneath the earth , i can feel myself getting upset . i can hear it too . a certain atonality and bassy resonance . the software is emphasizing the underlying major chords , levelling the dynamics and removing all syncopation . it  s trying to calm me down . i focus , trying to push the shuddering , rising feedback out of my aural sphere . the exercise , the meditation of trying to alter the music , rather than alter the emotions , feels like playing an instrument , the input is so disparate from the output it  s hard to believe the two actions are linked . but it only really works in situations where i  m not interacting with anyone . it  s pretty damn hard to play an instrument and hold a conversation at the same time . so i remove the earpieces . this will naturalise my mood but i  m not in a position to use them anymore . newline newline i head down the hallway into the central chamber . from the main chamber came a steady blue glow , lighting up the lining of refuse close to the end of the hallway . newline newline the air gradually becomes sickly sweet as i approach the nest . the hum of electronics becomes louder and more pressing . newline newline i turn the corner and see that disgusting alter once more . a viscous anger rises from my stomach . newline newline how could you let me see you like this ? newline newline like a metallic birds nest lies the alter . long ago , he laid his body down on this simple table in the centre of the room . every square inch of his skin blossoms with meters of wire , tubing and sensory cables . the array of threads and spines rises up from his decaying frame like a forest , accumulating on the high ceiling before drooping back down into various esotery in the chamber . such is the quantity of cabling and wires that enterleave his body his shape is splayed over the table , like something pried open for observation . it is as if he had been carrying a horrible pregnancy of steel , copper and fibre and had lain down in the chamber to painfully birth the alien material out of every pore and orifice . newline newline the first time i saw this i couldn  t even entertain the thought that this was him . i ran outside and vomited . it  s a horrific sight , still . newline newline next to him is a woman . she is seated in the same chair as she is every year . the woman is sat up straight , as if to attention . once again , she is wearing clothes unlike anything i  ve seen in the city . undoubtedly , she is from the community , from the towers . the first time i came here i searched her thoroughly , fearful yet a little curious . i searched her pockets , examined her body . nothing unusual . newline newline well , they  re all human at least . newline newline she is his voice and his body for this session . a peripheral . i suppose some kind of deal was arranged long ago , my considerate and loving husband loaning out another woman  s vocal chords and facial muscles to disturb and torment his wife from afar . the woman  s spine appears to be rigged up to the canopy of equipment above . her eyes are bleak and empty betraying the fact she is now a tool of some other being . newline newline  he  s coming  , the seated woman spoke .scribbles and scratches . once we start to color outside the lines , what is left ? it s not as if there s some deeper meaning to be found outside the boundaries , and meaning is what we re searching for . or is it just to be remembered ? well , i will be remembered , i can tell you that much . if not for the lives i have mysteriously taken throughout the millennia , it will be for the inventions i have wrenched bleeding and screaming from the unknown into being just for their sake of being . sure , an insurmountable army of eyes will behold them for generations to come and think them miracles , but for me they are trifles . and yes , i was given a burst of a chemical here or there in the brain for having nurtured these ideas from the miracle of birth through the various harbors of life . newline newline at a certain point , sailing from one harbor to another is not a chore , it s an escape . but it does nt excuse the sheer loss of meaning once you start to feel the walls , the edges , the boundary . once you ve expanded that much , you might as well start looking inward . because that s the only place left to expand . newline newline i ve reached the edge and found the back of my head . there s nothing left for me here . no burst of chemical is enough to drag my tired army of atomic dust forward . i surrender . let me become what is else , what is new , what is old , i do nt care . newline newline meaning left me cold and hungry long ago .i did nt follow the prompt exactly sorry newline newline with energy moving through day always she was . that one most beautiful , my one true love was walking so softly with flowers in her hair . that maiden most lovely with fierce spirit i know well and have loved many years it s the truth , and the story i ll tell . newline newline i met her in high school , that one with golden locks more thick and full of the most beautiful scent , but we did nt run in the same crowd , that shy , virgin goddess who somehow came to love me . newline newline walking , she walks slowly and tentatively , as if frightened or filled with fear , but in that tentativeness with her sad serious face i long for her all the more looking from my station here in the woods where all seems so wonderful with my love so near . newline newline walking softly she moves through the newly sunlit woods with a true fire in her heart , a true fire and burning grows within her , inside those ragged dirty thorn torn clothes , inside that bruised and tired looking bruised maiden with hair a mess and cheeks red from running . newline newline  stop it you fucking psycho !  she screamed as she stumbled the hillside with tears now streaming down her swollen and scratched red face which beith that face i love more than any other face i have seen since my being in this world of constant pain , in this world of never ending pain , in this world where pain exists only because of love and beauty and remembrance of warmth . newline newline  pretty , pretty , pretty , pretty why ya so sad and why are your cheeks red with tears prettiest one and only to get the blessings of my forever enduring love , my love that you rejected and wanted no more , my love that has existed unrequited all throughout all these past years , my love that you never wanted and that was just self seeking anyways , that never did you any good anyways .  newline newline  how is this going to do any good  she screamed at him as she ripped her ways through the briars , as the briars tore at her beautiful pale skin , as she crawled her way up the lush and steep hill side as she felt like giving up now , as she remembered their faces now , as the images flashed across her face , as she saw that there was a tall cliff at then top of the hill , as she defeatedly jumped to the rocks her true love dead and not wanting to be raped again .newline let me explain newline have you ever tried to make a person laugh ? i mean , really tried . have you ever prepped for , worked towards , put everything you could into planting the seeds of an irrepressible smile into the mind of your fellow man ? newline newline it s bullshit . well not bullshit , it s just difficult beyond measure . you have to be on their level but , at the same time , capable of subverting their expectations . for me , it s a sisyphean task of the highest order . newline newline have you ever tried to make a person angry ? because it s easy . it s indescribably simple to annoy , anger and upset almost any person . you might say right now ,  oh well i m pretty thick skinned so i m not sure i agree sir .  fuck you . if i stabbed you with a fork you would immediately change your tune . newline newline this was my realization , one lonely day in june , as i watched a couple holding hands from my second story dorm room . i just was nt capable of making people laugh and smile . those skills , which came to the handsome bastard on the quad as easily as blinking , were dark territory to me . i realized that i only really had two routes left to take , i could either have no impact on people whatsoever and be ignored , or i could garner attention in a negative sense , i could affect other people s lives as an acerbic , antagonistic force . newline newline sometimes i just need to be noticed , to have an effect . i hope that makes sense . newline newline  newline newline  what did you say to me ?  i glare down at the wiry man in the city square . i can tell he s intimidated . he replies , with a noticeable stammer . newline newline  s ... spare some change please sir .  newline newline my glare hardens .  are you fucking kidding me ?  i raise my voice so the passers by can hear my argument .  why ? why do you deserve my change ?  newline newline  i ... i just want to get ... for a cup of tea .  newline newline  that s not why you deserve it . can you tell me that ? why do you deserve my money ?  i press him further . newline newline he looks up at me , words caught in his throat , he does nt have an answer . instead he simply tries to avert my wrath . newline newline  i m sorry sir . have a good day . god bless you .  newline newline  fuck off .  i bat away his niceties with a swift curse .  you have the gall to ask for my money , so you can spend it on fucking street drugs and 2 litre bottles of cider . you have no fucking clue how hard i work .  newline newline the people nearby have overheard everything . they all watch , but none of them try to stop me . you would nt think it but they rarely do . the wiry man hangs his head , hiding from my gaze as he fixes his eyes on the pavement . he mumbles something but i ca nt discern it . i decide i m done . newline newline  here .  i snarl at him as i throw my morning paper onto his lap .  get yourself a job .  newline newline i then walk off through a group of shocked bystanders . newline newline  newline newline i wait in a cafe to see if he reads the newspaper . if he does nt i ll have to go over to him which i never like doing . as i ve said before i just ca nt interact with people . newline newline it happened the same way it always does . when i mock buskers , insult waiting staff , lambast the beggars , it always sparks an outpouring of good will from everyone around . that s why i do it in crowded areas . the wiry man will eat for a good few days on the charity he received from citizens , offended by my cruelty . hatred s a great motivator . newline newline i watch him as he places the small , but considerable , pile of pound coins and fivers in his pocket and , thankfully , unfolds the paper . he flicks through the pages absentmindedly before reaching the midpoint . i see his brow furrow as the envelope falls onto his lap . he reads the message on the front then , curious at it s apologetic tone , slices the envelope open with his index finger . newline newline he pulls out the note and begins to read : newline newline let me explain newline have you ever tried to make a person laugh ? ...sitting in steve s office

jumping ship now meant that there d be a long wait between paycheques just as rent was due , but target paid  .10 more an hour and i had enough experience that i could probably get 30 hours a week . newline newline steve s horsey laugh interrupted my thoughts . he was in the break room next to his office , flirting with janet in sporting goods . she was half his age and unattached , which made her a prime target . she hated steve , but she still laughed at his jokes because he d put her in toys for a month when she told him she was nt interested in him . getting put in toys for the

set his coffee mug on a stack of papers .  been busy all day . and thanks for coming in a bit early  i know you have to clock in soon , so let s get to it , okay ?  he took a slow , deliberate swig of his coffee , then continued .  it s coming up on christmas , and we need all hands on deck until midjanuary . you know the deal  you ve been here since ... let me see ... .  he shuffled through a stack of manila folders . newline newline  two years come february ,  i said . newline newline  two years . long time . so you know how it is . i ca nt give you a saturday off just because your sister is getting married . think of the shoppers who are gon na be all over the place : who s gon na help them out ?  seeing that i was unfazed by that line of reasoning , he leaned a bit closer and said ,  what about your coworkers ? think it s fair they re gon na have to pick up your slack on a saturday ? i doubt they ll like that .  newline newline whatever . i figured he would ve said no anyways . i just made a mental note to trade with jimmy . he owed me a day and did nt work saturdays . mostly i had brought it up so that i could leverage my next demand . newline newline  so if i m too valuable to get a day off   he squinted at me suspiciously   then i m going to have to ask for a raise . fifteen cents an hour .  i folded my arms across my chest , hoping to look calm and collected . he thought it over for a few seconds . newline newline  no .  shit !   labour s way too high as it is  i mean , yeah , i it sucks being on minimum wage   newline newline  for two years ,  i interrupted . newline newline  right . but that s a good thing for you .  seeing the bemused expression on my face , he explained .  if you get a raise , one of three things are going to happen : either a : you re going to lose hours , which means less pay each week  b : i have to cut someone else s hours  you would nt want me to do that , would you ?  or 3 : you might lose your food stamps , which means you ll be paying more for food . you think walmart pays you so little because we re greedy ? no , it s because we take everything into consideration and pay you what works out best for you .  this was , of course , the unofficial walmart responce to any requests for raises , and was complete bullshit . still , i had hoped that two years would ve earned me something . fuckers . i simply shrugged my shoulders . newline newline  i just wanted to give you a chance to meet what target was offering me ,  i bluffed . he seemed to have bought it , judging by how it piqued his interest . he did nt respond , though , so i stood up and made my way out .  guess i ll go punch in .  newline newline end part one .this subreddit got me writing again after a few years of no creative writing . so it inspired me to write at all . newline however , what made me write more seriously ... newline i wrote a prompt response that was ... substandard . due to being less than 30 words , it was hidden on

felt shame , and resolved to do better : to weave epic tales for all to enjoy . newline so , yeah . this subreddit got me writing , and a poor effort on my part inspired me to better uphold my end of the bargain of being an author in this illustrious creative forum .another day , another sad and lonely day . newline newline i ve become so used to being lonely since my accident . drinking and driving was such a wonderful idea ! landed me in the hospital for a week and killed my gf . i did nt even have that many . two beers is apparently more than i could handle with the rain . newline newline all that was two years ago and i still ca nt seem to let it go . my buddy dave keeps encouraging to go out and be social again but i do nt know . i worry how alison would feel about me trying to date again . before the accident , we would often talk at length about our futures together . we had it all planned out . could i really let myself become entangled with someone else s life like i did with alison ? newline newline i guess tonight i ll find out ... . newline newline as i arrived to the bar dave had invited me to , my focus was instantly drawn to a girl at the bar . it did nt appear that she was with anyone and no one was talking to her . my attention was suddenly grabbed . newline newline  dude , you really need to loosen up some . try to have some fun .  said dave . newline apologetically , i said ,  sorry . i m just trying to focus .  i did nt want to ruin dave s evening as well as my own . newline  all you got to do is go talk to her man .  newline surprised , i said ,  what are you talking about ?  newline without missing a beat , dave replied ,  you ve been staring at the bar since we got here . i m not sure who you re checking out but if you do nt ask , you ll never know .  newline newline dave was right . i could nt live my life alone forever . alison would nt want that for me . i like to think she would have wanted me to be happy more than anything else . so i decided to make a move . newline newline the closer i got to her , the more familiar she looked . her hair mainly as i had nt been able to get a good look at her face but something just seemed familiar to me . newline newline  mind if sit here ?  i asked but she just continued to stare forward or down at her drink . maybe she just did nt hear me . newline newline after a while i finally got the courage to try to talk to her . amazing what i little alcohol will do for confidence . newline newline  my name s robert . you come here often or just here with friends ?  i said . newline again , she just stared down at her drink but slightly turned her head so i could see more of her face . i was shocked . newline newline  alison ? !  i said . newline at this , the woman started to get up and walk away but i stopped her . she turned to look at me . newline  i m not who you think i am . just leave me alone .  she said somberly . newline she was right . it was nt alison . maybe my mind was playing tricks on me . at this i just sat back down at the bar and ordered another drink . newline  did you see her too ?  said a timid voice to my right . i looked over to reply and i was awestruck . a beautiful woman that had to be around my age was sitting on the stool the right of the mystery woman that had been there before . newline  yeah , i thought she was someone else .  i said . newline  i did too . what a coincidence ! the thing is no one else seems to have noticed her .  newline  what do you mean ?  newline  i ve been coming here for a month now and she s always here . day or night . same barstool . same clothes .  newline interested , i said ,  but how do you know nobody else notices her ?  newline looking a little annoyed at this , she said ,  i asked the bartender one night and he looked at me like i was a nutball . i did nt want to raise a huge stink about it but how could he not see her . he was standing right in front of her . tonight was the first time i ve ever seen her move either besides just her head .  newline newline after exchanging names , margret and i talked . and talked . and talked . it s weird how two peoples lives can be very similar . almost everything that happened to me during my life had happened to margret . even the accident . her now dead boyfriend was drinking and wrecked his car the same night that i wrecked mine . newline maybe alison really does just want me to be happy afterall . newlineellen sat motionless on , or rather was enveloped by the oversized leather lazyboy . she no longer had the capability of

chair ,  she thought longingly , picturing the classic wooden rocking chair with the hand sewn cushion .  these modern folk have no concept of subtlety . how is a lady to sit properly in such a contraption ?  newline newline fond memories of days long gone were quickly interrupted as the family lab came shooting from within the bowels of the home , taking up new residence at the window beside the door .  ah the lady of the house must be back ,  ellen said to herself as she began her efforts to free herself from within the ample seating , movement hampered greatly not only by her position on the furniture but also her hunger . newline newline ellen at length came to her feet , straightening her dress as the homeowner walked in . ashley was her name  a woman in her thirties and of modest physique , ellen saw a bit of herself in her . though she still could not surmise why this woman insisted on wearing pants . even knowing it was common these days , it seemed improper . newline newline ashley warded off the barrage of loving licks from the tail wagging dog and made her way to the bathroom . ellen tried to follow but was becoming more sluggish with every step . her vision suddenly blurred and her mind became like cool molasses as thoughts just couldn  t quite form . she suddenly could not recall what she needed to do . she felt peckish , that much was clear , but she no longer knew where she was or what to do . ellen collapsed on the floor and the room began to spin . newline newline when ellen came to , it was dark . she had never truly lost consciousness , but was so disoriented that all concept of time was lost . by no means was she feeling well , but ellen could at least stand and make cohesive thoughts . walking over to the kitchen , she looked at the calendar hanging on the refrigerator ,  she has it crossed off until august second . ok i was only out for about a week this time.  newline newline ellen slowly made her way to the bathroom , hardly able to stay on her feet .  its not here ,  she cursed as she stumbled into the bedroom . ashley and rick she believed , were sound asleep with the dog curled cozily at their feet .  there it is ,  ellen spoke as she walked over to the bedside table and with every bit of strength she had , grabbed the wedding ring that lay innocently among ashley  s possessions . newline newline instantly , ellen felt sharper of mind as she fed off the ring .  she can have this back in a few days when i  m done ,  ellen said on her way back to the enormous chair . with each passing generation , ellen found that people became less sentimental about their possessions . food was increasingly scarce and she already drove the last people out of the home by feeding too often on the same items . they noticed her and sold the house , but at least they had a few items to feed off of . the current owners threaten to starve her entirely . sitting down with a face full of satisfaction , ellen knew at least she had just bought herself another few months .we crucified him . newline newline you crucified him ? newline newline crucifixion . we took two wooden posts , nailed them together to make a cross , and we stuck the cross in the ground so it stood up nice and tall . then we tied his arms and legs to it and left him hanging there for a few days until he was nearly dead , and then we stabbed him in the guts with a spear to finish the job . newline newline to your savior . you call him . . . jesus ? newline newline jesus . newline newline you hanged him by a post and then stabbed him with a spear ? newline newline i would nt say we hanged him . hanging is more of a european thing . that s when you put a rope around somebody s neck and toss em out of a tree . much quicker that way . no , the romans liked to make a show of it , that s why the crucifixion . takes longer , there s more suffering . they had nt gone through the enlightenment yet . newline newline the enlightenment . . . enlightenment . . . i do nt have that in my records . this came after jesus ? newline newline oh , a long time after . it was a new age of science and reason . newline newline so , while you initially rejected the savior we sent you , eventually your race arrived at this enlightenment through him ? newline newline well , i would nt say that exactly . the church did nt much care for the enlightenment at first  the church of jesus , i mean  and we put a whole lot of folks on the rack for saying things like the earth is nt the center of the universe . newline newline do i even want to know what the rack is ? newline newline sure . that s where you tie a person to a plank , kind of like a bed , and you stretch him out until his bones come loose . sometimes you re looking for a confession and you ask em questions in the meantime . newline newline i see . and it was the savior s church that did this ? newline newline yessir . all water under the bridge , of course . we do nt even hate queers anymore . newline newline hmmm . . . getting back to this crucifixion . . . i m having trouble even forming the question . let s say , why did you torture and kill our messenger of peace of love ? newline newline well hindsight s twentytwenty i suppose . who was to say he was nt a kook ? a lot of people for a long time liked to blame it on the jews of course , and some on the romans . personally , i think if you did nt want us crucify him you should of set him down somewhere in nebraska . newline newline they do nt crucify in nebraska ? newline newline no sir . i mean , there s always the electric chair , but there s a process for that . newline newline so you tortured and killed our messenger of peace and love because hindsight is twentytwenty and we did nt set him down in nebraska . is that your official statement ? that s what you want the record to show ? newline newline sounds fair . newline newline and the church that eventually developed around him  god knows how  this church tortured people for being reasonable because of something called the enlightenment . newline newline there s no denying history . newline newline and what exactly is this church up to now ? newline newline charitable works , proselytization , weddings and funerals . we pretty much just adapt our values to mirror secular advances and try to guilt folks into the pews . newline newline so you re not crucifying , hanging , racking , or electricchairing anybody . newline newline not anymore , no . newline newline would you say that , in spite of your past , you ve become a church of peace and love , as intended by the savior we sent you ? newline newline well . . . newline newline oh god . newline newline we do currently have our hands full with this child rape scandal . we re spending a lot of money in court . newline newline child rape ? ! newline newline it s because we do nt let our priests have sex . they go a little stir crazy and take it out on the kids . newline newline your priests are raping children . newline newline some of em , yeah . newline newline how  are there any members left in this church ? newline newline quite a few . newline newline how many ? newline newline a coupla billion . newline newline billion ? did you just say billion ? newline newline yeah . billion . newline newline fuck it , welcome aboard . newline newline newline newlinei double and even triple checked the date i had been given the day i was born . i called my parents and even called the federal office of death to make sure . newline newline  f.o.o.d speaking , how may i help you today ?  she sounded friendly enough . i explained my situation to her and she laughed , insisting there must have been a mistake .  i m sure it was a typography error on your copy of the paper . can you read me your identification number , please ?  i read it off and she had me wait a second as it processed . i nodded my head back and forth to the annoying little hold tune that played .  sir ?  she said as she took me off hold . she hesitated before continuing .  you are correct , your date has passed ...  newline newline i nodded dumbly to myself , glancing down at the paper that read last friday s date .  so what does that mean for me ?  newline newline she cleared her throat before continuing .  well , sir , you have two options . you may request immediate termination , in which case we will reschedule your death . we can either let you know the date or surprise you .  i shook my head , appalled at the option . newline newline  what s my other choice ?  newline newline  well , sir ... we do nt recommend the other one .  newline newline  i want to hear it .  newline newline  the other option , sir , is that you continue living without a specific termination date .  i raised my eyebrows , surprised , although she could nt see me . newline newline  why is that not recommended ?  newline newline she cleared her throat again , starting slowly .  well , sir ... you see , our printing system occasionally makes mistakes leading to incorrect dates printed , as i thought might have been your case . however , central universal life termination does not make mistakes . if your date has passed ...  newline newline i interrupted her , thoroughly confused .  my date has passed . clearly they made a mistake .  newline newline  no ...  she began awkwardly .  what this often means is that you might be good as dead . you have nothing left to live for nothing of importance will happen in your life but you have crossed a threshold . you are nothing more than a burden to society and the central universal life termination group will dispatch their trainees to eliminate you ... for practice . you are actually too insignificant for the termination group to spend resources or trained employees on terminating you .  my jaw dropped and i slammed the phone down , ending the call . i looked around at my empty apartment , trash littering the floor . the skeleton of my dead goldfish stared at me from the dirty fishbowl . too insignificant ?  i clenched my jaw , grinding my teeth in anger before shaking my head to myself . newline newline  no ,  i said outloud , wondering if i qualified as crazy for talking to myself . there had to be something i could do to prove them wrong ... something to make myself significant . i grabbed my coat and tore out the door and for the first time in my miserable life , i felt something akin to determination . i will do something .  newline newline my phone rang as i stepped off the elevator on the ground floor . i answered curiously , not recognizing the number .  hello ?  newline newline  your termination request has been accepted . your life will be terminated shortly . this can not be cancelled . please hold to listen to this message again .  newline newline  newline newline thanks for reading ! if you enjoyed this , please check out more stories at rmatiwrites . constructive

was at my expense . newline newline later that day , i saw the news and it broke my heart . i recognized that suv and the stick figure family on what was left of the rear window . why does this always happen ? every family . every time . i m a fucking curse on the world and all i ever do is try to be as friendly as possible to people . but where does this get me ? where does it get them ? ! i m

m a god , i do nt know . all i know is , the first time i drew something  the mighty morphinpower rangers fighting my babysitter  it turned out real . and i do nt mean like , the picture started moving  i mean i could actually step in the drawing and watch the little world i d created live its life . newline newline and trust me , you do not want to be inside a fiveyearold s crayonandpoop masterpiece . newline newline so yeah , i do nt know how i do what i do . i ve gotten better . went past the need for a graphic medium now , i can create straight from my mind , with more details , and almost the size of an actual planet . but i still do nt know how . newline newline i do , however , know why . newline newline and if you saw the number of zeroes on the checks i get , you d figure it out too . newline newline the rich and powerful pay me to make pocket dimensions for them . i ve created countrysized pleasure domes full of every flavor of lustful creature you can imagine , spiritual retreats with vistas you ve never seen on earth , country homes , i ve even created a moonsized extradimensional emergency shelter for the ruler of china  the real ruler , not that figurehead xi . newline newline but when laszlo walesa contacted me with a request , i still hesitated . newline newline  so you want ... earth ?  newline  yes , that s right . down to every city , every house , every person .  newline  mr. walesa , i m good , but what you re asking ... i ve never done anything like that before .  i stammered .  if you d accept scaling down ...  newline  no .  that was final .  i want it as it is . i ve taken the liberty of writing you your retainer already .  newline newline i checked . and when i told you about all the zeroes ? there were about five more than even i m used to on that transfer . my heart skipped a beat . newline newline after that , it was all about getting to work . i traveled  expenses paid , of course  all around the world , taking pictures and notes and meeting people . back home , i got to work . opening up the dimension is easy , molding the basics of the world too  that only took me most of two years . the details are the tough part . minerals and soil took me two more years , plant life five , animals seven . newline newline funny , you do nt appreciate how beautiful the world really is until you make its twin . when you spend the best part of two decades seeing the world as it is , and making it as it should be . i came to love it  it made me want to take vacations everywhere once i was done . whether in the real world or in my copy , i did nt care . newline newline people were going to be extra tricky . i knew i could nt make them all to order  that would take me more than a lifetime  so i cut some corners , replicating a few millions here and there . newline newline people still took me ten years . you ca nt understand what it is to feel like a god  like , as descartes said , the great watchmaker of the universe . i understood most of all why so many believers call their god father  i was a father to these people . newline newline at the end of the work , i d made everyone in the world  more or less . my final piece was making my client himself . mr. walesa , after a tour of the world , agreed to model for himself . i took extra care of the details  moles , pores , and hair . and at the end , there stood , innocent , smiling and bald , my own childish version of laszlo walesa . newline newline  excellent work !  laughed the real walesa .  from what i ve seen , it s exactly what i wanted ! your last payment will be approved shortly .  newline  and that , i believe , concludes out business , sir .  i added , satisfied .  if i may , what are you going to do here ? rule ?  i d worked for power freaks before . newline  rule ? of course not ! could nt imagine anything drearier . no , what i m going to do is what i ve always wanted ... but could nt , out there .  newline newline and with speed and strength that no man his age has any business having , laszlo walesa sprang towards himself and broke his own double s neck . newline newline  now , please leave me .  he said as i stood in stunned silence .  i ve got some overdue fun to have . please leave the dimensional door open when you leave , my people will come shortly to deliver my weapons  newline newline and with that , he pulled out a handgun and sauntered out in the street . newline newline i stood there in shock for a few more minutes until one of walesa s men shook me and told me  not unkindly  to get back home . i left , heating distantly the votes of my children dying , of my world burning . newline newline i am no god .i got the call about 8 oclock while sitting on the couch half concentrating on some important news article on the tv . the phone rang and i grabbed it quickly since it was something to do . newline newline there was a lot of fast talking , some distressed notions and little bits of worry stuck in for good measure but overall the underlying message was clear  my girlfriend was dead . i had nt seen her for 3 weeks . she had been on an important business trip which required a fair amount of flying except one of the journeys had gone horribly wrong , a plane crash over the himalayas resulted in 14 casualties including my girlfriend . newline newline it took me a while to gather what was i told . the phone dropped from my hand and i stood motionless . newline newline it was nt long before the happiest smile planted itself in the middle of my face . i rushed outdoors and grabbed my bike and quicky checked my watch . you see , this plane crash was nt a bad thing , no not at all . it meant i got to see her early . her business trip was nt meant to come back home for another 4 weeks . i was barely coping without her during the first week , i was literally nothing without her . newline newline i stood squarely to the door of my girlfriends house . her respawn point . opening the door i quickly shouted to her . anticipating her voice , craving it . i almost fainted thinking about the joy i d get from seeing her . i anxiously opened the door to her bedroom . newline newline nothing . not a single soul . my mind raced for a solution . maybe she respawned somewhere else ? no that never happens . i exhausted all possibilities in my head for returning home hoping she had respawned early and had walked over to my house . newline newline the tv was still on . it s glared at me with a menacing light . the news headline said it all : newline newline  they are nt coming back anymore  anderson . anderson ! you have got to try one of these godsteaks.  newline newline jackson stepped out of the elevator and strode into the control room , still chewing with relish and brandishing a second plate for anderson , dripping with gravy . most of the crew had gone downstairs to join the celebration , but anderson was still surveying the monitors , dutiful as always . newline newline  oh , thanks man i thought the line was going to be forever.  anderson waved at the central monitor , evidently a satellite view down over the prostrate body of god , now sprawled at the base of the appalachian mountains , his greybearded head in virginia and his feet somewhere in the eastern townships of quebec . other screens showed heavy machinery hard at work slicing off chunks and putting them on flatbed trucks , which were conveying the pieces to trains  some destined for storage facilities prepared in northern ontario , and others for ships headed to greenland . newline newline  any problems with spoilage ?  jackson asked , impressed with the signs of efficient industry . newline newline  nah , the meat seems especially resistant to bacteria and dessication , but we  re not sure how long that will last . so as you can see we  re going fullsteam ahead with the coldstorage plans.  anderson had begun to dig into the plate with gusto .  holy shit guy  s seriously tender for an old dude !  newline newline  i know , i know . better than we  d hoped . but the hair is superstrong  they think they can use it asis for the space elevator cable.  jackson scanned the other monitors .  hey , any word on the dead ?  newline newline  yeah mmf mmf ,  anderson replied through a full mouth ,  processing has started and mmff the heaven ones are relieved just to be free of the tedium , and most of the hell ones are pretty cool people , actually . lots of fun . we ve got psych people and security on hand for the rest.  anderson wiped his mouth with a napkin and pushed the plate aside for the moment .  there are lots of them of course , but now that the physical constraints are unlocked the guys at the institute have begun to dial up the mass of mars to get ready for colonization . they  re going slowly for now , but that  s just overcaution if you ask me . soon we  ll have it all sorted . should be able to take everyone for now , and later we  ve got jupiter to play with . oh ! and terraforming should be a cinch . michael said he  d help you wouldn  t believe the size of the ploughshare he  s got with him.  newline newline jackson smiled and nodded with approval .  yeah , i talked to barnes and he said the angels had taken a vote and most of them were looking to set up a commune somewhere in andromeda . some of the archangels are just confused , but that  s always the way with middlemanagement  take away their direction and poof  complete indecision . but on the other hand , you should hear that gabriel  turns out he  s been sneaking away to jazz classes for decades , and now that he  s playing out in the open he  s pretty damn good at it . got a record label in talks and everything licketysplit.  newline newline anderson nodded knowingly .  our biggest problem seems to be the hardcore christians . turns out they weren  t kidding  the threat of eternal punishment really was the only thing keeping them from raping and murdering . you should have seen them go at it once they saw the footage . but we  ve got people cleaning that up now . some of the devils are proving pretty handy at that work , and assured us they knew that particular crowd well and knew just how to handle them.  newline newline anderson looked thoughtful for a moment and seemed to be weighing something . then he smiled and said to jackson in a lowered voice ,  bill , you wouldn  t believe it . the sensor people say that now that the big dude is gone , they  re picking up some weaker signals that were being masked by his carrier wave . look over here.  he adjusted some dials and tapped some keys , and his desk monitor switched to a dark scene that was partly obscured by static , but could still be made out . newline newline jackson whistled .  is that what i think it is ?  anderson nodded and smiled .  it is . valhalla . looks like next year  s budget renewal will be a cinch.  both of the men pumped their fists and highfived . newline newline just then the elevator doors slid open and danforth strode into the control room brandishing a plate and still chewing .  omigod anderson !  she said ,  you have got to try one of these godsteaks !  newline newline it was going to be a very good day . newlineinside me there is a deep abyss within which resides a living darkness . it is an endless energy source for all things from dread to sadness . i do not have to pull ideas from this pit , but rather i merely need to stopping struggling so hard to keep it at bay . newline newline this is not a jest where i tell a dreary story because you asked why people tend to be so dreary in these . i am what i have said . doctors fill me with drugs . these drugs do not make me feel normal  ha , normal  i can no longer comprehend this concept  but instead serve to dull all my emotions in the hopes that by suffocating my connection to joy that my demons , too , can be kept contained . though i struggle against it , i have told track of how many battles i have lost . there have been times that i took a blade to my flesh just so that i could feel something other than morose and numb .the first night on which isaac awoke he was overcome with an insurmountable feeling of anxiety . he had been pressured into trying nod by a friend , using the term loosely , and was already beginning to regret his decision . he had never abused drugs  save perhaps for nicotine  , but peer pressure often breaks even the strongest of men . isaac never stood a chance . in his old life he had been nearly thirty and still a bagboy for the local supermarket  now he was four years old and named ibis , if the birthday cake  s icing was any indication . he tried desperately to think of what kind of name ibis was egyptian ? maybe . as his newfound family circled around him and urged him to blow out the candles he realized that the hype was real . nod had worked .  an entire life within moments ! leave your old failures behind !  the campaigns for nod had been fierce , the opposition fiercer , but isaac had always doubted it really worked . how long could it possibly last ? newline newline at five years old , isaac started school . he could read and write far better than any of the other students and was quickly labeled as gifted . by seven he had proved that he grasped the basic concepts of algebra and biology and quickly ascended to the ranks of wunderkind . days became months and months became years and soon ibis  mind was filled with proofs and theorems . gone were the memories of playing on the playground , gone were the memories of being  discovered  in kindergarten , gone were the memories of his fourth birthday . soon ibis met the love of his life . she was young and he was young , as lovers so often are , but they knew that there would be no one else . ibis worked hard to create a better world for his jessica and , within six months of their marriage , their daughter . newline newline the diagnosis came as a surprise for everyone . ibis didn  t want to leave earth , not yet , not with so much left to be done . he needed time to think . he needed time . the treatment was relatively new , as he understood it . typically prescribed to the critically ill . he agonized over his decision , sleepless nights and tear soaked tissues littering his home . eventually ibis and jessica concluded that it was for the best . he would take nod . newline newline the first night on which ibis awoke , he was overcome with an insurmountable feeling of anxiety . newlinethe sirens were deafening as they reverberated round the international lunar base  ilb  , the orange warning lights sweeping across concerned faces of workers in the hangar bay . the bay was huge and contained lunar rovers and parts of spaceshuttles and other general junk . on the north side of the bay was the officers bridge , a raised platform that overlooked the bay . second officer pascal got on the console located near the airlock and tried to hail central command . a face appeared on the small screen next to the keyboard and second officer tom recognised this as commander briggs . the feed must have been frozen as the commander was motionless with a strange expression on his face , that fell somewhere between shock and confusion . pascal tried several times to establish an audio link but there was no reply and pascal eventually gave up . newline newline  fuck ! 2 weeks in and already the base is falling apart !  . the frenchman kicked the console for good measure . newline newline chen , the chinese first officer who oversaw the hangar bay stood up from her chair and put away her walkie talkie . newline newline  what  s up with the console pascal ?  newline newline  its dead , i can  t get through to central command . and this siren is giving me a mal de tte.  newline newline chen turned to 2 junior officer and barked in something mandarin , after which the young officers entered the airlock . chen turned to pascal and tom . newline newline  tom use my walkie to get on to engineering and get them to turn this siren off.  tom took it from chen and starting barking into it . newline newline  is that a good idea ? aren  t sirens usually used to indicate something is caput ?  pascal had somewhat calmed down and was working on the console again . he put the display on the main screen where there was a map of the entire ilb , which connected two deep craters , the hangar on the right and the main entrance on the left . the left entrance was red to indicate a breach , but the rest of the facility was green . newline newline  there ! see ? there  s a breech at the main entrance , that  s not good but it looks like it  s just the entrance module that  s been compromised . the base was modular like a spacecraft so that if a catastrophic event occurred in one of the modules , it would not affect the rest of the station . tom returned and before he could say anything the sirens and lights turned off abruptly . newline newline pascal turned around  newline newline  the cc still won  t reply , i  m trying the science station.  chen leant back in her chair , she was puzzled as to why cc wont hail , as the only fault on the system is the entrance module , something was not right . newline newline  tom get combat officers to arm up , just as a precaution .  newline newline  is that really .. ?  newline newline tom thought he was going to be melted by the intense stare of first officer chen and turned curtly to the group chatting in the middle of the hangar floor . newline newline pascal brought up an incoming transmission message he had received and put it on the large screen . newline newline there was screams and shouting before any video could be seen , then suddenly someone  s face came into view . chen recognised it instantly as her sister , biyu . she had been crying and had blood splattered on her face and clothes . newline newline  somethings here !  she shrieked , her face was the embodiment of fear . chen noticed how dark it was and seeing a gun next to her sister thought she must be stuck in a gun cabinet . thank god the americans had led this project she thought . newline newline there was a loud bang as someone , or something banged against the cabinet from the outside , biyu shrieked again and a message with transmission ended popped up as the screen froze . newline newline chen fell to her seat and gave herself a second , before standing up again , in control .  right , combat specialists on me.  she shouted down to the hangar . newline newline the specialists , donning matt black tactical suits and mp5 submachine guns climbed the steps to the platform and stood at attention , chen took stock . there were 9 men and 3 women , all american . whatever had attacked the base and her sister was in the science station which was east , next to the hangar . she ordered 2 to stay with the hangar group and headed to the east airlock with the specialists , pascal and tom . newline newline after stepping through the airlock , the group walked down the short corridor that connected modules and entered the science station airlock . a few seconds later they found themselves in a bloodbath , the tang of iron hit chen , catching the back of her throat . in front of them was several parts of a human being , but it could have been from several humans , it was hard to tell . newline newline the building layout was much more claustrophobic than the hangar , 3 of the specialists with guns raised took point . they crossed into the next room , with the rest of the specialists surrounding the officers . chen eagerly looked for a gun cabinet that may have her sister in , but there were none . as the group moved into the next room it opened into a central plaza , where several wings shot out in different directions . a reception area was painted red with someone  s blood , a head with lifeless eyes was the only thing visible this side of the desk . one of the specialists bent over and emptied their stomach on the floor , it did not help the smell of the room . newline newline suddenly a quiet and meek  hello ?  came from a cabinet on its side behind the desk . it was biyu ! after breaking off the lock with the butt of a gun the group pulled a battered biyu from the cabinet and helped her to her feet . the sisters embraced as biyu burst into tears newline newline  is it still here ?  she said into chens shoulder between sobs . newline newline chen ordered the specialist group to split into pairs and investigate each arm of the plaza to try and find the unidentified monster . pascal was trained in first aid and used a wall mounted first aid kit to patch up the injured biyu and as he did , chen tried to question her sister . newline newline  what is it , did you see ?  newline newline  no i just locked myself in as soon as the screams started.  newline newline pascal pocketed a pistol and some ammo from the cabinet , he had served in the french army for a few years and was well acquainted with guns . tom on the other and was an academic from cambridge and had never held a gun in his life . newline newline tom was startled as something in his peripherals caught his eye . standing at the entrance of one of the arms , was a statue . well it certainly looked like a statue with a chalky complexion , however the shape of this thing was strange indeed . the outline was like that of a lion , but the head and fangs were more reptilian . as he blinked something strange happened . it moved . newline newline in the milliseconds that he had taken to blink , this thing had moved a metre forward . it hadn  t walked , it had looked like it had teleported in front of his very eyes . another blink saw it move again , another metre . newline newline  guys   newline newline the group looked at tom and then followed his gaze . newline newline the monster was close enough to see that it had blood dripping from its fangs , its eyes were blacker than black and unmoving . there was a burst of gunfire and a scream from one of the left wings which distracted the group which turned instinctively . a flash of white saw the beast appear and it had started to bite through the arm of pascal who was now under the beast and whose arm was in its jaws . pascal erupted in pain and tried to rip is arm out of its grip , succeeding in only making the arm break with a bone chilling snap . newline newline tom saw another flash of white and looked past the frenchman and saw an identical creature just outside of one of the left arms . chen and biyu backed up to the wall with tom as pascal was whimpering as his arm was not budging from the monster  s jaw . he pulled out his gun with his free hand and fired 3 shots . tom covered his eyes instinctively . as he opened them again pascal had been dismembered , and one of the beasts was an inch from his face . a steady drop of blood hit toms nose from the right fang of the beast , tom held open his eyelids with his fingers trying to work out what to .when i was younger , i never really understood why someone would want to end their life . a friend once described it to me as skipping to the end of a book . you have no connection to any of the characters , no concern for the plot , and not a care for even the setting . all you want is to know how it ends . newline newline if you do nt care , then what s the point of even skipping to the end ? closure , i suppose . newline newline i needed that closure . newline newline it s sunny today . why today of all days ? maybe i should wait until tomorrow . it would be selfish of me to ruin anyone else s day . newline newline i guess that is where my problem lies . i ve always wanted the best for everyone else . even if i was having the worst of days , i d have to smile . i needed to smile . at least , that s what i tell myself . never mind . you have to have tough skin . the sun wo nt hide for me . newline newline the bridge seems busier than usual . this is good . perhaps no one will notice . slipping through the railing seemed to be a lot easier

water does nt even look real . well , from what i can tell . the sun reflects off of each wave and is almost blinding . fucking sun . the number of car horns is distracting my tranquility . are they actually acknowledging me or are they annoyed with the other cars ? either way , this is my day and no one will intervene . newline newline i have never given much thought to how i was going to do it . do i jump ? lean forward and let it happen ? too late to decide i can hear sirens in the distance . are they coming for me ? how did they get word so quickly ? were they finally acknowledging me ? too late . now is the time . i take one final breath in , let go of the railing , and begin my ending . newline newline they always say your life flashes before your eyes right before you die . aside from the sun s blinding reflections , what i saw were all of the sacrifices i made for everyone else . such a depressing final thought . they never did thank me , no kind gestures in return , nothing . they took me for granted . how ever will they go on without me ? they need me . i should ve written a no  newline newline bzzt bzzt bzzt newline newline who s calling me this early in the morning ?

. is this a joke ? newline newline it s unusually dark in my room this morning . opening the curtain , i realize it s raining outside . more like storming , actually . is this a joke ? because it s making me crack a smile . it s as if my ending was nt good enough . i have to do it again . i need to do it . the weather is fitting . no one likes bad news on sunny days . time to get walking , i suppose . this is the perfect day for closure . newline newline edit : spelling  rambling you know , cassie , you got a pretty good racket going on , do nt you ?  newline newline cassandra looked up at the voice , pushing her prescription sunglasses up the bridge of her nose . all she could really see was a vaguely human shaped smear , but the voice was instantly recognizable as gordon , better known as  the golem  . he was a very typical flying brick hero , with the gimmick that he was actually made of clay . none of that would be a bad thing , but he was also a complete asshole with a persecution complex the size of jupiter .  hello gordon . is there something you need ?  newline newline  nah , just chatting .  the reddish smear moved and her desk creaked under his weight as he sat on it . she mentally thanked the upper brass for making the office paperless so she did nt have any forms for him to get grime on .  just wanted to get some advice on how you go about running a total fuckin  scam , that s all .  newline newline  i would nt recommend asking for that in a government office , gordon .  newline newline  aw , do nt be coy , sis !  his voice sounded friendly , but there was an almost concealed venom under his words .  i mean , lookit ya . good ol  blue collar heroes like me and the other street levels are out busting our butts for a raise , and here you are , sitting easy going inside where your only job is to tell us the future and get it wrong about half of the time . i mean , shit . at least weathermen have to stand up .  newline newline  speaking of weather ,  cassandra said ,  exactly what is it you re hoping to gain from me going out there on the streets and frying like an egg ?  to accent the point , she lowered her sunglasses , showing off her icy blue eyes , and twisted a finger through her tight white curls . newline newline  it s a metaphor , cassie . what s the probability you know how those work ?  newline newline  100  , presuming no sudden , unexplained shift in the standards of english .  newline newline  ooooh , a rare 100   gordon waggled his fingers close enough to her face that she could see the definition of them before he pulled them away .  point is , you re here making bank for basically just doing guesswork .  newline newline  it s not guesswork , gordon . it s not my fault that most things are closer to fifty than to a hundred or zero .  newline newline  yeah yeah . hey , if your power s based on your brain absorbing all available information and extrapolating from there  or what the fuck ever ,  he flicked her glasses , his stony fingers leaving scratches along her nose ,  how s it work when you re nearly blind ?  newline newline cassandra shrugged .  how do you digest food when you re made of brick ?  newline newline even without being able to see details of his face , she could tell gordon was frowning .  look , sis , i just do nt like being bossed around by a glorified weatherman . so tell me , what s your little probability say is gon na happen right now ?  he leaned down in her face , close enough that she could smell the sub he had for lunch , and the desk groaned in protest . newline newline instead of answering right away , cassandra pulled her phone out of her lap , revealing that it was on speaker , and that the caller id read  rolling thunder .   i do nt know , gordon . why do nt you try telling me ?  newline newline even though she knew it was impossible , cassie liked to imagine his red face going as white as hers as the door creaked open behind him , and a deep , rumbling voice spoke up .  yes , golem . why do nt you try predicting what i m going to say to you right now ?  newline newline gordon whipped around , standing at attention so quickly that he broke off a corner of the desk .  mmister thunder , sir ! this is all just a  newline newline  it s funny you say glorified weatherman  ...  the air in the room began to grow thicker , reeking with the strange , sweet smell of ozone .  cassie ? tell me , what do you think the forecast is about to be in my office ?  newline newline cassandra smiled sweetly , folding her arms on her desk .  99  chance of thunderstorms , sir . he lifted his arms again . he had swung so many times , even his bones became weary of it  but he did not stagger . he would always continue . newline newline it s been a long time since he had stopped counting his swings every day . it mattered not how often , it matterd that he was consistent . newline newline he pushed all of his energy , all of his passion , his of his feelings in every swing , and not one was weaker that that before . newline newline with every swing , he would help his people , he would bring a tiny bit of prosperity to his people , and he would weaken their most terrible enemy . newline newline and he swung , and hit where he wanted to hit , as he always did . it was the last swing of his tool for today , he would continue tomorrow . newline newline soon , the field would be ready for sowing , not long after that there would be harvest , and maybe they could make it through the next winter without surrendering any of theirs to their greatest enemy . mr. graves , are you certain your client has been telling the truth ?  the voice of the judge cut through the room . i glanced up from my papers , and stood up , taking off my gloves and scarf . newline newline the jury panel gasped a little bit when they saw my unscarred face and hands . more than a few looked jealous , but most merely looked impressed . i nodded . good . i had affixed myself as a person who told the truth in their mind . newline newline my client , meanwhile , was a mass of scars . they marred his face , hands , neck , biceps . a few of them were deep and ugly . he was staring at his handcuffed hands , looking despondent . newline newline i cleared my throat .  yes , your honor . and i intend to prove not only to you , but to the men and women of the jury that the evidence the state has not does not prove my client s innocence , but that the evidence proves his innocence !  newline newline the jury mumbled amongst themselves as i launched into my opening statement . newline newline   newline newline  thank you , mr. graves ,  my client said , grinning in my office , wearing his ratty yet comfortable clothes once again .  i thought i d be locked up for good , but you ... you pulled off a miracle.  newline newline i smiled a little , straightening my posture and linking my fingers on the desk .  it was nt me , mr. williams . it was your testimony that made the most compelling argument .  newline newline williams smiled , the scars on his face stretching and distorting . newline newline  mr. graves , you re a godsend . i can never thank you enough . i m going to go and try and pull my life together .  newline newline there . a small little slice , right by his ear . it was nt much , and he did nt notice it , and i did nt stare . no one deserved to be caught , especially in the lies they tell themselves . newline newline mr. williams thanked me profusely , continued to make that same promise that tore open that scar a little more each time , then left . newline newline when he was gone , i once again stood in the mirror in my office . i unbuttoned my shirt , allowing myself a wince as i opened the shirt a bit further . yep , it was still there . the one scar that i had from telling myself the lie . the biggest lie i had ever told , and it was the only reason i was still around . newline newline i took a deep breath , looked myself dead in the mirror , and mouthed the lie to myself . newline newline the pain lanced through me as the scar reopened once again , starting at my collarbone , opening up through my stomach , curling around my belly button , and immediately soaking my pant leg with blood as it ended somewhere in my inner thigh . newline newline the pain had been enough to knock me out the first time i had told that lie . my parents had rushed me to the hospital . now , all i did was grunt , set my teeth , and reach for the suture kit on the counter in front of me . newline newline that lie hurt , even more each time i said it . but i had to let myself know i was okay . even if it was a lie .carol went to work anyway . what else was she going to do ? newline newline she put her travel mug in the cupholder , tossed bag in the passenger seat and started her little honda civic . resident parking was on the bottom level of the parking garage beneath her building . she drove up and up , past the empty parking spaces . she stopped , as she did every day , waiting for the gate to go up and let her out . newline newline duh , she thought , rolling her eyes at herself . she got out of the car , stepped into the parking attendant s empty booth and hit the button to open the gate . newline newline it would take some getting used to . she pulled out of the garage , stopping and looking both ways for traffic she knew would nt be there . newline newline cruising through downtown , she kept finding herself stopping at red lights . just in case , right ? newline newline with her luck she d be one of the last people in the city and end up getting tboned by some other asshole running all the red lights . newline newline she turned on the radio to drown out the quiet . that was the worst part . back before it all started , or well , before anyone knew what the fuck was going on , she d moved downtown to be surrounded by city noise . she loved it . silence set her teeth on edge , made her nervous . now , just like everywhere else it was dead quiet , empty . newline newline the radio host started chattering about the weather . she smiled to herself . it was amazing how nobody talked about it . people disappearing , dragged out of their beds at night , never to be seen again . not a peep from the news . then again , what would they say ? newline newline the only place anyone talked about it was online , and not on facebook or twitter . well it was there if you really looked , lots of messages like  stay safe honey ,  and photos of empty city streets . the real speculation , the pointed discussion happened in person or in private messages . even conspiracy theorists in the seediest corners of the internet had gone dark . even they were afraid . because this thing , whatever it was , it did nt have a face , did nt have a name . nobody knew what the fuck was happening . newline newline probably the illuminati though , right ? maybe the rapture ? even the religious nutjobs did nt like that one . jesus was supposed to lift true believers into heaven , not rip them out of the beds at night , kicking and screaming . newline newline still , she thought , pulling into her parking spot , it was surprising nobody got a picture of one . whatever they were . well , not yet . newline newline she grabbed her bag and coffee and headed toward a nondescript black building . she clipped her id badge to her chest and walked right through security , waving at the one security guard who even bothered to show up . back in the day there were armed guards , but these days nobody really gave a fuck about national security . newline newline  morning ,  she said . newline newline up to the fourteenth floor , and past rows and rows of empty cubicles , only a handful of heads popping up as she passed . tired , redrimmed eyes followed her into her office . of course her analysts came in every day , it was their job to be curious , even before people started disappearing . hours and hours poring over radio chatter and satellite photos of some sandy campsites in bumfuckistan had little relevance in today s world though . instead , they had a new job . newline newline something was up . she set her bag down and turned to head back out into the cube farm . her assistant marty was weaving through the cubicles , clutching a red manila folder to his chest . he d been up all night , she could tell from his stubble and greasy hair . newline newline  we need to talk ,  he whispered . newline newline carol shut the door behind him , pulled the blinds , shutting out the whole office . newline newline  is that what i think it is ?  she asked , holding out a hand for the folder . newline newline marty nodded ,  maybe ?  he handed her the folder and looked away . newline newline she opened it , inside was a single photograph , blurry , gray , newline newline  what am i looking at ?  she asked newline newline  right there ,  he said , pointing to the bottom corner of the photo . newline newline  holy shit ,  carol said . newline newline they finally caught one on camera . a screencap from an infrared security cam somewhere in argentina . six gleaming eyes and a vague silhouette .song lyrics : newline you can try to take us , but we re the gladiators , everyone s a rager , but secretly they re saviors newline newline lorde  glory and gore newline newline the cheers of the crowd could be heard all throughout rome . prisoners from persia have been taken to fight for the delight of the roman emperor today . even within my dark and musty cell i could hear them . cheering for death . summoning him . i look up as i hear the jailer walking towards my cell . newline newline  today will not be a happy day for you gaius ,  he warned . without another word he unlocked my cell and bade me forward to the armory . newline newline i met the other prisoner gladiators at the gate , they were your average blackened , dirty , and glowering meatheads . i nodded to them and they grunted in response . the cheers of the crowd was deafening as the gate was drawn up on our side and we walked proudly out into the center . the other gate was drawn after a long moment . the persians were decked out in full combat armor with iron weapons and thick shields . newline newline we charged them , the slaughtering had begun . gladiator blood and persian blood mixed together on the dirt . they were skilled fighters and had the advantage of armor but we re the gladiators and we had the home turf advantage , we led them into an alleyway of the ruins within the arena and ambushed them . our numbers soon became even and all looked well for us . the emperor himself looked on , unsure , savoring every kill . newline newline that is until the persians grouped up and began to get organized . their strategic abilities far surpassed ours and began cutting down our soldiers left and right . i attempted to rally our men for one final defense but i was interrupted by a lucky spear throw through the chest .  this is the end  i thought to myself . my life flashed before my eyes , with all its gritty realities and memories . i experienced the pain of losing my family when i was unfairly taken in for thievery . i was whipped and beaten for the first twenty years of my life . newline newline it made me think that this is not such a bad thing , it is merely an end to a terrible life . i thought to myself they are secretly our saviors , ending us from the lives we led as prisoners forced to fight for our emperor . then everything faded to black..tony liked basements . newline newline they were usually small . low ceilings . lots of smells . kinda place that a cat could take a nap , if one were so inclined , or just eat the head off a mouse and play with the body . newline newline but this basement had other cats in it . one was a foreign cat , with pointy ears and a long neck . and tony did nt like foreign cats . even when they were gagged and hooded and tied to a chair . seemed like a waste of string . newline newline  fuckin  orientals ,  he hissed .  i m tellin  ya , boss , just let me work im over for a while . just for a minute .  newline newline  patience ,  john purred . tony flicked his ears but bowed his head . john was a sleek aegean , real refined like , with a suit and tie and a gold necklace . never seemed to break a sweat , even when the work got hot and heavy . roots in the old country . tony always felt a little out of place next to john , with his mongrel pelt and shabby corduroy trousers , but it was comforting in a way to know that someone else was doing the thinking and giving the orders . newline newline  take off the hood ,  john said . tony nodded and whipped the burlap sack off the oriental s head . just rough enough to let him know that they meant business . newline newline the oriental blinked in the harsh light and then fixed tony with a baleful stare . tony felt his tail start to puff up and a low growl started in his throat . newline newline  he s eyeballin  me , boss ,  tony hissed .  just a couple swipes , i m beggin  ya .  newline newline  i had hoped it would nt come to that ,  john said , snapping his jaws open and shut with a sudden yawn . as if the whole shebang was making him bored . the oriental shifted his gaze and john grinned , sharp teeth glinting .  where are your manners , tony ? we just want to talk . right ? just a quick little chat .  newline newline john reached into his suit and pulled out a dull black cylinder barely larger than his paw . the oriental s eyes narrowed and tony took an involuntary step back . his fur rippled as a cold shiver ran down his back . newline newline  boss ,  he whispered , but john did nt even twitch a whisker . newline newline  you might want to close your eyes , tony ,  john said , with bonechilling kindness . tony let out an involuntary mrrp and turned away . beating up on somebody was a honest way of letting them know who was on top . hell , cutting their throat , even . cat to cat . sharpest claws and quickest on their feet . but there were other ways , ways that tony just could nt stomach . newline newline john did nt have that problem . tony heard the little snick as the laser pointer clicked on , and the sudden thrashing as the oriental tried to break out of his chair . even just knowing that there was a little red dot on the wall somewhere sent tony s paws twitching . he knew better than to peek . one look and he d be tearing around the room . you just could nt stop yourself . he did nt know how john could handle it , but judging from the the mewling yowls the oriental did nt have it in him . terrible thing , to need to chase and not be able to . worse than cutting his balls off . newline newline  you can turn around now , tony ,  john purred . tony obeyed automatically , without thinking . when the boss says jump , you jump . his gaze met the oriental s briefly , his own face reflecting back at him in those big wide black pupils , fear and rage coming out as hard as if the oriental was screaming instead of thrashing and biting against the gag . then tony saw the red dot , plastered right in the center of the oriental s forehead . newline newline and his claws came out . newlinethe army ten thousand strong started the walk down the hallway . the deafening sound of phasers charging roared through the hallway . the walls seemed to close in on them forcing them to fall in line one in front of the other all the while the march slowed down to a desperate crawl . the phasers grew louder and louder as the approached our position . a beastly creature vaulted over the lines bashing a privates skull into the floor . the beastly horror stared directly at our cloaked positions , his eyes gleaming like gemstones with a distorted lump of flesh and bone protruded from his nose . he was a south born , more machine than man , a living testament to the inhuman experiments engineered by chris . his visual processor scanned the hallway to no avail he could nt detect us . in a mad rage he ripped off the helmet of the closest soldier cackling as his brains were sucked out of his nose . i pulled out my tilia the raw energy contained in the strap on my wrist had done all i had asked of it saving my life many times . johnny gave the signal of shields up and my tilia vibrated with excitement it s spiked front prepared to bash in someone s skull . i was to lead the charge this time .i dont know if this is what you are looking for , but ill go with it anyways because it kinda relates with this promp . newline newline  real story incoming  newline i was on the lasts days of an operation to capture a drug lord down in brazil and i got shot in the head , right above my left ear . soon as i heard the sound of the bullet i lost consiousness . newline newline i woke up in a grass field . the wind was blowing really hard and the sky was clouded but there was enought light to see relatively well . in the distance i was able to see a single tree standing . there was no one around but me at that moment . as i started walking towards it i remembered what happened back in brazil , i checked my head but there was no wound , anything . newline newline once i reached the tree , there was a beautiful girl sitting on a branch . i still remember how she looked . her skin was tan , her hair waved gently and she had a faint smile on her face . newline i was still confused as to why i was there and not in brazil , or in a hospital at least . but it never crossed my mind that it could all be just a dream , or that i was probably dead already . newline newline she climbed down the tree and asked me what i was doing there . i explained her my situation and she just waved it off like if i was crazy . we started walking past the tree , that was probably 13 or 14 feet high . after a long walk we reached a car . it was already dark and rain was not far away from us . as we were going into the car , she started hurrying me up  tho i think i didnt spend more that 10 seconds to get in  . when i got it , i distinguished something moving in the dark . a fucking long , pale , naked man started running full speed towards the car . we drove away . newline newline to make this shorter , because i could take 50 pages writing what happened after , ill tell you all of it in a paragraph . or so . newline newline we arrived at a small bunker that night where i was explained what was happening because i obviously looked like a foreigner to them . i swear to god i spend at least 6 months with these people , in which i fell in love with the girl . we were constantly getting out to shoot those pale , naked fuckers as if they were the plague . newline one day , i was in my room with the girl , we were already in what you could call a relationship  and i still didnt knew her name , or i dont remember ever hearing it  when she showed me a small rock that gave a low green light from the small cracks it had . newline she told me that rock was gon na be able to get me back to my world , because she knew what happened to me and from where i was from . newline and here comes the most fucked up part of this . she opened a door , and in the other side , i saw myself lying down in a hospital bed with support equipment attached to me . like if i was watching a god damn movie through the door . i freaked out , and when i finally calmed down she told me i had 2 choices . i could go back to my normal self , or i could stay there with her . newline in a heartbeat i decided to go back . she hugged me , but i kept thinking that she wasnt real , that it was all a dream . but how come i was able to see myself from that perspective in a dream ? i crossed the door with the stone in my hand and woke up in the hospital in the exact way i saw myself throught the door . newline newline that was 2 years ago . i was shot and went into a coma during 4 months after i was taken out of brazil . i spend months trying to figure out that experience i had . i achieved nothing until a year ago , when i saw a girl that looked the exact same as the one in my dream in a supermarket back in the city where i live , buying baby diapers with a big smile in her face as she carried her baby with her . newline newline call me crazy , but this is my experience . i probably had seen her before and well , all that happened . every time i think about this , it just loses a bit of sense , like if it was slowly fading to become something that never happened . but it still troubles me that i saw myself in the hospital bed . newline newline im sorry if text is confusing , english is not my first language .

newline  kyle , i m leaving .  but she was nt able . the door was locked , the windows were unbreakable , and the cat was caught in the dryer which was running . the horrible meows were thrown in with

but i just want to leave .  the cat dies , the dryer stops , the lighting fails . newline newline  wait a second , the lights are still on .  sarah is always the most observant in a room . as if she

the hell is going on .  newline newline sarah thinks . she thinks some more . she takes off her shirt . newline newline  what the ever loving fuck ... no , i do nt .  but , kyle should be shirtless

the lighting was dark now . newline newline  the lights are still on .  sarah is determined to promptly correct the situation . she puts her shirt back on . newline newline  my shirt was nt off .  she

kyle is now masturbating . newline newline  i am not . i am doing nothing of the sort .  newline newline  kyle , do nt listen to this shit . let s just find a way to leave .  newline newline they had

or hibernate out of our sight . newline it s the beginning of summer and the locals are rife with anticipation of the annual mating ceremony commonly referred to as prom , during this time young males will approach females they are attracted to and perform a ritual in attempt to woo her so that she will attend prom with him . these ritual can vary massively depending on the attractiveness of that male , his characteristics and most importantly  his social standing . newline newline on the outskirts of the school a young male is about to perform this ritual for the third time this week , he has already failed twice and with prom fast approaching , he s getting desperate , having left the comfort and familiarity of the library his eye has been caught by a female with whom he often gathers with socially . on this occasion she is apart of a small herd of females , they gather like this to ward off who they deem to be unacceptable mates . newline newline usually our male with be off put by this group but time is short and the thought of loneliness is powerful motivation , in an effort to exude confidence he pulls back his shoulders slightly and strides over to the corner which the females have claimed as their own . the whispers within the group stop and the newcomer calls out the name of the female with whom he wishes to mate , excluding the love interest of our male the females back off a few feet to form a wall behind ready to strike should anything go wrong . newline newline this show of power breaks the facade created by the male and his faux confidence is removed , stuttering , he finally gets the mating call out  will you got prom with me ?  . with this sentence , the female begins to flush in the face eager to end this encounter she rapidly shakes her head and retreats back to the safety of her group who have begun to whisper and giggle amongst themselves . deafeated , once more the male slinks off back to the library to plan his next attempt .emma

time in a dozen century , emma forgets about flying .money makes people do strange things  for a start , it makes them want to spend most of their lives pursing it and only taking off the yoke of such a vulgar pursuit when they are no longer considered fit for purpose . why go through all that bother to simply end the pursuit only when one can not enjoy the spoils ? even when i was a kid i saw all these people with glum faces and found it unimaginable that i would end up like that . but at 35 , i have to say that my younger self would be ashamed that i  ve waited this long to even contemplate making a one big payday and setting off on the road , to milan , to rome to singapore , to anywhere but here . newline newline intelligence is not something that i have ever been associated with , but i was a wellmannered child and a mild mannered man , which is what lead me to becoming a chauffeur . i  m not even considered as a person most of the time , a mere automaton , i  m sure a lot of people have gotten in and out of that car without remembering that there was a journey in between . it didn  t take me long to realize that this was an advantage that i could exploit . what i  ve heard and seen needed to be capitalized upon and i knew just the target . newline newline the mayor is the most duplicitous person i have ever met . whenever people hear that i drive him around and take him to all of his functions i  m always asked if he is really as nice as he seems on tv . i do answer in the affirmative , i don  t mention the hookers or prostitutes or that i  ve installed a microphone and hidden cameras in the car . newline it took a few years to earn his trust and i did have a pep talk the first time we picked up a woman who was not his wife . sure , he tips generously , but he is a millionaire , if he wasn  t drunk or high he would spend more time driving one of his ferraris . he  s boasted about his millions many times so now it is time for me to see what he values more , his family or his money . newline newline with all his debauchery it  s little wonder that he pays me handsomely to drive his daughter to her practices and lessons . so this fine afternoon i took a little detour before feigning a breakdown in a secluded road . she got out of the car like the good little girl she is and didn  t struggle when i tied her up and put her in the trunk . i drove down to this little cabin out of town by the lake and made the call . i said .  i have your daughter , if you don  t drop off three million dollars in cash she is dead and if you go to the cops she is dead and all the shit that you have done , remember ? well , that is all going to be released to the press because i have it all on tape . i don  t care that you know who this is , you  re a smart man , i  m giving you 24 hours . i will text you the location , and if it is not there this shit happens and i vanish , you  re the one who has to decide how this all goes down.  newline newline and now we wait . newline... and , upon breaching the perimeter , realization set in upon the pillagers that , due to unfortunate prior planning on their part , they d actually broken into the remnants of the us army s human resources command , whereupon they were immediately stricken with deep , irreversible , and near catatonic stupor by the bewildering array of compliance posters , regulatoryadvisory pamphlets , and bits of various forms still scattered about the place . thus ended the tale of our brave adventurers as the sun set in the west and the subtle nuances of the americans with disabilities act echoed as the last thoughts flickering out in their tiny mortal brains . newlinethe miniature baseball field was painted in greys , the small figures on it frozen in action . the memory of motion persisted , thrumming against the temporary hold hilda had placed like water trying to boil under a heavy lid . she did nt know what had called her to such a place  in her millennia of service , she d retrieved a spare dozen children . newline newline she moved across the field , her fullsized stride eating up space like a giant in fenway . it was fairly obvious what had happened , even without the benefit of motion . the tall fence behind home plate was laying horizontally on the ground , flat aside from the small body crushed underneath it . from the position of the child s body , it had been attempting to escape the fall . newline newline the same child was standing a foot away from its body , its soul the only source of color aside from hilda herself . the child turned to stare at her , confusion on its face as it looked up from its body . there were three emotions that hilda was accustomed to dealing with  confusion was better than anger , but generally more taxing than fear . newline newline it was supposed to be a quick inandout retrieval , but hilda was curious . why was a nine year old being taken to valhalla ? hilda prided herself on her work , and had never mistakenly brought an unworthy soul to her home . she was not about to start now . newline newline  who are you , child ?  she asked , voice echoing in the frozen moment . newline newline  k ... katie , miss ,  the child said , staring almost straight up as hilda towered over her . newline newline hilda surveyed their surroundings with suspicion . she d seen battlefields of all sorts  martial , political , romantic and domestic . a school playground was new .  are you of a line of warriors , katie ?  newline newline  huh ?  the child blinked , and seemed to remember herself .  miss ?  newline newline  your family , girl ,  hilda said , irritated .  are they accustomed to battle ?  this child did not seem worthy  had she truly been sent here mistakenly ? newline newline  um ... my mom is a bus driver ,  she said . newline newline hilda sighed , casting her gaze about for a clue , any clue .  how did you die , child ?  newline newline  i died ?  katie did not seem surprised  rather , it seemed as though a suspicion had been confirmed . she looked around , then pointed at the fence over her body .  the backstop fell over . i tried to get everyone out of the way , but ... i was nt fast enough .  newline newline hilda stopped her fruitless search and turned her attention back to the child s body . she had died saving others ... a hero s death , true , but not a warrior s . there were places for heroes , psychopomps for the virtuous , but she was called only in specific cases . newline newline  what were you doing here ?  hilda asked , looking once more at the field . newline newline  kickball , miss ,  katie said , standing a little straighter as she said it . newline newline hilda recognized the tone in her voice , and instantly understood .  i see . are you good at ... kickball ?  newline newline katie nodded , in that curious way that children have that makes one think their heads are about to snap off their necks .  i m the best in the school !  newline newline everything clicked into place as hilda saw the field with new eyes . these soft times did not allow children to take up arms , but war was waged in many forms .  and these children ... they respect your skill ?  newline newline  well ...  katie began , suddenly hesitant once more .  they know i m good at kickball . they still make fun of me sometimes .  newline newline hilda nodded , smiling kindly . her presence was not a mistake after all .  and you feel most comfortable playing kickball ?  newline newline katie smiled .  yeah , miss . it ... it just makes more sense . sometimes i do nt know why they make fun of me . but i can kick really good .  newline newline hilda nodded , surveying the frozen children around the two of them with scorn .  words and accusations are the tools of the weak . manipulation is the weapon of cowards .  newline newline katie sighed .  i wish school was more like kickball . this is the only time anyone likes me .  newline newline hilda smiled . the life of a warrior was hard , defined not by blood but by struggle . but warriors fight on , through heartbreaking losses and hardwon victories . they do this not because they wish to , nor because of some great principle . true warriors , the kind that were worthy of hilda s attention , fight because it is the only thing that makes sense  it is all they can do . newline newline  come , katie ,  hilda said , taking her hand in her own .  there is a place where kickball is the only thing that matters .  newline newline  that sounds awesome ,  katie said , squeezing hilda s hand tight as they began the long walk back .i woke up in a small white room . two cops guard the door and a man sits at a white table across from me . one of those stereotypical detective types , brown trench coat and all .  oh fuck ,  i said out loud , as i look down at my hands , which have been cuffed . newline newline  oh you better believe it ,  the detective said ,  we ve finally caught the keymaster , the one responsible for breaking the scrum and muck of the earth out of jail for years.  i look at him dazed , then i sit up with a smirk on my face .  congrats . seeing as i was unconscious , i have to ask : how d ya do it ?  i say , as i start coughing . newline newline newline  well , it was nt easy , but after magnum got caught , we decided to set up a sting for the mythical keymaster ,  said the detective ,  and guess what ?   what ?  i ask just for the set up.  he exists !  said the detective ,  knocking you out was the easy part .   yeah and keeping me here is going to be the hard part ,  i warned him . newline newline  oh please ,  he said ,  we have airtight security here . no one goes in or out without me saying so .   but you forgot one thing ,  i said , after dropping to cough again , newline newline  i can break any lock .  newline newline at that moment , my handcuffs released . i grab the detective by the neck , grab his gun , and shoot the two guards . i hold the gun up to his head , and say ,  thanks , but i m taking my leave now . have a nice day !  i pull the trigger and that stereotypical detective is no more . newline newline i walk up to the door and open my mouth . i reach down into my throat and a key pops out . it s a weird power , i know , but it s kept me alive this long . i open the door with no effort , then proceed to go get magnum from his cell . newline newline  let s try this again , shall we ?  newline newline this is my first writing prompt . please leave any feedback ! thank you for reading .cyrus sat near the fire , his eyes closed as if in deep thought . athene looked at him , wondering what in the name of the gods the fairhaired healer could be thinking of . newline newline  he s still meditating ?  grao sat next to athene , two freshly killed rabbits in his hand . newline newline  i think he fell asleep .  athene rolled his eyes and put down the stick he d been using to poke the fire . newline newline it had been two months since the three joined forces . well , since cyrus joined to be more precise . their most recent mission was to capture at least three black dragoons for a certain hotheaded blacksmith in town . athene was nt exactly friendly with cyrus , but he was nt exactly hostile either . newline newline  i can hear you .  cyrus opened one eye and looked at the young redhead . newline newline if one needed further proof the blacksmith and athene were mother and son , their temper was certainly said proof . a glance had set of athene s nerves and he was already a few yards away when grao finally noticed . as expected of a little thief . newline newline anger soon turned to panic as an arrow lodged itself in a tree just inches from athene s face . three more arrows followed , and athene ran . he was nt sure if he was heading to the others . he reached for hia dagger , only to find it was not there . newline newline by the fire ...  he remembered setting it down , but not picking it up . he swore under his breathe and tried to remember the path he took after so childishly stomping away . newline newline an arrow hit athene right in the shoulder . it only slowed him down , but it was just enough for athene to see a flash of steel aimed right for his head . newline newline he closed his eyes and dived for the ground . or rather , he was pushed . athene looked up and saw a familiar figure in pale white and blue clothes . the green eyes that had somehow angered athene earlier were now intensely focused on the bandit in front of them . newline newline cyrus had a steel wire wrapped around the bandit s wrist . with one pull , the bandit lost a hand . newline newline blood was practically pouring out the stump , and athene was still in shock . what cyrus did next added to it . newline newline with a quick flick of his hand , cyrus had manipulated the bandit s blood , cutting the man quite viciously . from the bushes , grao emerged with the rest of the bandits tied up together quite neatly . newline newline athene had forgotten the arrow in his shoulder , only to remember when cyrus tried to remove the arrow . seeing a friend hurt must be painful in its own way , judging by the small change in expression . after finally getting the arrow out , all that was left was to tend to the wound . newline newline  just hold still , alright ?  grao patted athene s good shoulder . for once , athene did nt think of it as condescending . newline newline the fairhaired healer moved his fingers in slight , sharp movements . athene s blood moved accordingly , forming a small fourpointed scar where the wound had been . cyrus seemed to smile . no , he did smile . newline newline athene remembered hearing about blood magic a few times before . how it was dangerously powerful , and the council considered banning it . but seeing it be used to heal was quite the sight . newline newline  i am tired . after submitting this i m off to bed . on a bright , warm day that had no clouds or a breeze to speak of , two figures lingered . one sat and the other stood . newline newline beyond them was an uneven thicket of dry looking green pine trees , blocking off the halfgrown sunflowers and weeds from traveling further than nature wanted them . newline behind them was more miles of dry pines and weeds and bushes , and some dirt far beyond , leading to nowhere that was good in particular . newline newline the only things that had nt melded with the face of nature were a homely fourbyfour and a hole in the ground that the two figures had been staring at for some time . as they sat , the wind pulled air through and around them , but they still were silent . newline some seconds after the breeze broke , the one sitting solemnly with his legs crossed decided to speak . newline newline  so what , in god s name , happened to my boy ?  the grizzled mouth on him spoke , the worn creases in his face shifting .  christopher smith , where in the fuck is my baby boy ?  his body language was still while he posed the question . newline newline the other man , not quite middle aged , had his eyes wide open , dead set at the hole in the ground . newline newline  i hoped at first he d be with this man over here , but not after ... that . god ... god , i know he ca nt be with him .  newline newline in the hole was a body . the dead body of a man , but the most notable features of that dead body were that his face did nt go beyond the nose , and his legs were buckshot below the knees . his tattered , white clothes fit with him , five feet in the grave . newline newline  he took them all , pappa . but i did nt see nothin  like this on the horizon .  the son looked back down to his feet and sat . he did nt know what to say for a few seconds before he looked back at his father . he continued on , newline newline  i did nt know why he d do this . he had everything until just today !  newline as he talked , he stared ahead , not sure how he d be as whole as yesterday . newline newline  nothing seemed wrong with mr. monty . we took his donations to him , we did everything he needed and everything he wanted . why , he had us like a big clan in that mansion . i dunno , pappa .  newline newline the old man looked to the right , and back at the hole . his face was naturally scowlmarked , and he had his reasons why . he could only come up with a short  christopher .  he also looked ahead , but there was an underlying anger in his stare . newline newline  he had a show . he healed people . he kept a club for carl to have his playmates together , and he got em to be nice , too . could nt be too bad .  newline newline the old man got out of his seated position and made his way to standing up . newline newline  yeah . he pulled the kids in with the fruits and toys , but i was nt even in on the plan . he only had some like him help him out . he drugged the juice . just like the ones in the commune we heard about on the news .  newline newline the grandfather started shaking his head , shortly to either side while christopher was talking . newline newline  i think he wanted to see himself that he could do that to people . but carol called , she told me that people were dying , and i heard a shot or two . i drove from the block over . she made it , but the kids took the juice . i heard another thing while i was inside .  newline  he was shouting as the kids were falling on the ground . newline  the nail on the top of the head , he was screaming his bullshit greeting to everyone . newline newline the younger man had been louder for some time , and he was noticeably getting more agitated . clouds to the east had gotten closer . he was looking back and forth at his father and the body in the ditch , and just kept getting louder . newline newline newline  he pulled that damned line where he acted surprised at that goddamned crowd , looked outside the window , and he just shouted that stupid line , boy , it s a joyous da   the man was punched square in the face . newline newline  christopher . i am ready to kill you .  newline newline the clouds rolled in from the east , and they had already been letting drops of rain fall on their way . newline the father and the son looked at each other for another few seconds , the father glaring down at christopher . newline the rain got heavier . newline newline after waiting , the old man looked down and back to his truck and said to the younger man , newline  there s rain , christopher . let s get going . newline i need to see my grand child one last time .  newline newline newline critiques if you can , please ! getting into these writing prompts . newline newline i was nt liking the way i wrote this one though . i kept feeling negative as i was making this  depressing story , man  , and it made it a lot harder for me to want to put in the time to focus on making the story cohesive . 5 clicks to

burned down government buildings , only to discover the smell of burning coffee . newline newline a conspiracy was brewing . newline newline ashes flew into the air as the post office smouldered . i watched as a rafter collapsed , sending debris flying my way . a blacked but distinguishable can of folger s rolled towards me . i smiled . this was all the evidence i need . newline newline in the

newline newline i write to you today to express my outrage and concern over a recent experience i had at your establishment . upon entering your tavern yesterday , i found to my dismay that an iron pole had been placed across the threshold . after yelping in pain from the contact it made with my knees  ouch !  , i demanded that your bearlike barkeep tell me why the entrance to brawny berry s barroom on bard boulevard was barred with a bare bar . alas , he gave me no satisfaction . as a noted barrister , please bear in mind that i fully intend to bare my feelings on this subject of your ironbarred bar to my colleagues in the bar , who may take legal action to bar your from receiving further patrons . newline newline yours in dismay , newline newline  the rt . hon . barrister isambard bruce brace bearinghallbarre , esq .  victoria cross with bars the djinn looked at the man , measuring him . humans seldom had the capability for considering beyond their own selfishness , but this was a different sort . the man looked intent , not scared or startled . he had nt broken a sweat , and was sitting comfortably in a chair , his gloved hands white from completely the summoning sigils in chalk . this clearly was nt his first time sharing a dalliance outside his kind . newline newline pulling his hoofed legs up under himself in a cross , he floated above the ground considering his host . an eternity passed before he stated ,  tell me what you desire.  newline newline the man uncrossed his legs , leaning forward in his chair .  were you aware of my existence before i summoned you this evening ?  he asked , no hint of malice nor fright in his voice . newline newline the djinn laughed , almost a small cough .  do nt flatter yourself . beyond contractual necessities , i rarely concern myself with your kind.  newline newline  do you remember any with whom you have ,  he paused a moment , catching himself before continuing ,  contracted with ?  . newline newline losing patience , the djinn responded  if we have business , i care . if we do nt then i have none . the point , please ?  newline newline the man stood , clapping white chalk from his gloves . the small cloud dissipated as he stepped through it . he was a young man of about 28 , wearing gray slacks and vest . his eyes and hair were both brown and perfect , not a single imperfection . he was a handsome man for his kind , mused the djinn . his irritation turned to laughter .  your theatricality is best saved for a more easily entertained audience.  newline newline the man proceeded as if the djinn had not spoken . he started to pace around the djinn .  a long , long time ago , a young man fled to this country seeking refuge . he thought he could start fresh , a new name and home to keep him content and safe from the troubles that plagued him . the many things he failed at , his optimism never halted . it was one of two redeeming qualities ,  he stopped pacing and eyed the djinn .  the other was his willingness to try anything.  newline newline the djinn s mood turned .  buyers remorse makes not a tale interesting , and reciting it does nt give you power !  his booming voice shook the empty building , the wood floors seeming to buckle under the onslaught of the djinn s wrath . newline newline the man stood , unmoved by the emotional outburst of the demon .  it s not that he entered a contract with you , but it s what he wished for.  newline newline  and what was it he wished for ?  , spat the djinn . newline newline  he wished for his family to be released from your curse . his father , and his father before him had been cursed by your visits . since you ca nt seem to recall beyond your immediate contractual obligations , i have no knowledge outside anecdotes how many of my family you have taken , but it s academic . the truth of it is that it simply is.  newline newline the djinn felt a sense of anticipation . he d heard this tale and hundreds of other like it , but the ending was always known . for the first time in his memory , he did not see an end game . newline newline the djinn probed ,  i ca nt release your family line from a contract if you were not the one who wished it , nor would i be obliged to grant any wish that would condemn myself in some way to prohibit collection of your being.  newline newline the man continued his pacing .  i know both of these things . i know that my father tried to leave a country to get away from you . i know he changed his name , his habits , his everything . i know this , because he kept a very detailed journal . it was a journal kept by his father , and his father before him , and so forth . all hoping that someone would eventually find you , and stop this nonsense.  newline newline  nonsense ! ?  the violence of the outburst reverberated throughout the building .  i ve entertained your arrogance long enough ! if you know these things then you know the futility of this grand gesture !  the man stood , observing , unwavering . this stopped the djinn , mid tirade .  if what you say is true , then i would have come for you . why hasten your exit from this mortal coil ?  newline newline the man returned his stare , answering  i made a new deal . not with you of course , but once you open that door it s a veritable buffet of discordant options . which brings me to back to you . you re not well liked among what i assume are your peers.  newline newline the djinn s astonishment slowly curdled . the man slowly walked back to his chair .  as far as i could understand , your kind derives power over those whom they have contractual obligations with . beyond that , you are no more harmful than your wits and trickery allow . someone as old as you is certainly powerful in your own regard , but that age and power comes with a weakness much more powerful.  the human walked up to the edge of the sigils , and squared with the djinn .  hubris  . newline newline all senses left the djinn at that moment , save rage . howling , he leapt to tear out the throat of the human , only to be stopped a hair from the man . the djinn could no longer move , blink , or even talk . the rage vanished , replaced only by fear . newline newline the human held his gaze , slowly releasing it as he walked back to his chair .  you ve probably done this longer than humans have recorded history . all summonings look the same more or less , so what s an extra sigil here or there . no use beating a dead horse , i m sure you would have worked it out . your contract , however , was with the father of every first born male child in our family . i assume some idiot in our family decided metaphysical intervention was preferable to our rapidly diminishing lineage . oh our males are miraculous , seemingly blessed at all things until a son comes along , and then a heart attack here , a stroke there . all thanks to you.  newline newline the djinn was still stuck motionless inside the sigils , desperately trying to escape .  the contracts kept with your kind are passed from one to the next so killing you serves little point other than my satisfaction . the debt that i owe you , however , is nt mine to owe . whatever sins my family made we ve paid for them a hundred times over . so release me from my debt , or we will both meet a terrible end.  newline newline the man slowly moved his overcoat from the chair he was sitting in , and the chair as well . it had obscured another ring of sigils , looking far more sinister than the ones used to summon the djinn . the demon understood what they meant , whom they were meant for , and terror overtook his senses . the human carefully walked over , pulled out his journal , and flipped to a bookmark . after a moment of reading , he crouched and carefully erased the top most tip of a  v  looking sigil to the djinn s right . the djinn started shrieking ,  it s done , you are cleared of all debts , just please let me go !  . newline newline the man stared , unflinching at the spray of spittle from the djinn .  then you ll have no problem notarizing it ?  he produced the journal , and flipped to the very last page . the djinn was awestruck at the foresight and control this human had . as the human crouched to clear another part of the same sigil he touched earlier , the djinn s left hand slowly regained movement . the human held the journal just close enough for the djinn to sign . newline newline i , the signator of this document , hearby renounce all claim to the ancestry , past , present , and future , of the familial line of the aggrieved party , and will make no claim on any debt made prior to this signature . newline newline the man took the journal , blew on the page for whatever the signature was made in to dry , and sat in the chair . after a moment , the djinn stated ,  i have fulfilled my part of the bargain , now release me !  newline newline the man replied ,  i never stated i would release you , though i implied . certainly you would never be as complacent as you are now , so i see no reason to court such a danger ever again . as far as my debts go , that s slightly more complex . you have nt really underestimated me , but the others you fulfill contracts with are different . you must have suspected , given that so few humans possess knowledge of anything beyond what they see . the occult still carries a taboo , a topic reserved only for the desperate and foolish . i may be a bit of both.  newline newline the man gingerly pulled off the glove of his left hand , revealing a cut , bruised , and blistering ring finger with a small obsidian ring . he inhaled sharply as the glove came off , the move exacerbating the wound .  the sort of desperation stretches both ways . the point is you prayed you on the wrong demons , and as for me ?  the human walked slowly over to the incomplete sigil ring behind the chair and completed it . he stood , delicately fingering the ring on his finger .  i ve made some new family of my own , and they are not fond of you nor the contracts you lorded over them . now they are free of you as well . by your own hand i might add.  newline newline dark clouds and ichor slowly crawled , tendril like , from the completed circle , ebbing towards the trapped djinn .  they are nt fond of humans , but i m sure in a couple of hundred years they may warm up to me . releasing them from you is a step in the right direction.  as the human walked out of the room , darkness enveloped the djinn . his last was a wish to be anywhere but there .i have been called many names throughout my life : scribe , messenger , newline destroyer , mindless minion . all these names describe what i did , not what i newline am . now that i m nothing but a shadow of my former self , people call me what i newline am , not what i do . the irony is nt lost on me . newline newline i have done many things in my life : i took notes , i conveyed messages , i

my masters back . i do so without orders . i do it because it seems the newline right thing to do . the irony here is not lost on me , too . newline newline it took the primitive beings of this world uncounted millennia to develop newline enough intelligence that i could make them my tools . my remains rested in the newline ground , deeply buried under markers that the natives considered sacred or newline cursed . fortunately for me , these socalled humans are more curious than newline clever . they are violent and greedy and social . sometimes a messenger can newline hope . newline newline my first host dug up a fragment of me in search of riches . he held the newline black shard up to his eyes . i slipped into his brain . newline he died in the process . i had been thankful for freeing me from my tomb and newline gave him all my knowledge . i do nt even know what he looked like . from the newline short time of our contact i gleaned what you would call his selfimage . he newline died from shock when i connected myself to all of his synapses at the same newline time . newline newline his death could have meant another few millennia of waiting , had nt the old newline shaman put his ear close to the mouth of my saviour . i slipped over into his newline brain . this time , i connected myself a few random synapses at a time . the newline whole process lasted over a year . newline newline by the time i was done , the men had returned to their country . in their newline fragile little sail boats they had crossed the ocean in search for riches and newline arable land . bad weather and unfriendly inhabitants spoiled their courageous newline endeavour . with almost empty hands , they returned east , to their cold lands in newline the north . at least , they brought me . newline newline the old man was my second victim . he too did nt take the integration well . after a newline while i noticed he saw things that were nt there . a few of my memories newline leaked into his . he could nt control it . two years after he had taken me newline from the dead man , the blind shaman killed himself . he could nt take the newline images any more . the images that leaked from my memories . images where i newline imparted messages for my masters . newline newline i had the chance to slip into the brain of his three year old grandson . this newline did nt kill him . i learned which parts of the brain i had to connect to first . newline unfortunately , if the host is too young , their mental development stops and newline they remain dull , infantile creatures . newline newline it took me another few attempts to get the age right . if i integrated myself newline in early adolescence , the host adapted quickly . he could even access my memory newline actively like i was an extension of his . i could pick the memories i wanted to newline preserve and transfer them to my longtime storage . this went on for a few newline generations . newline newline then came howard , the coward . my host at that time was a blacksmith . howard newline was the son of noble man . he approached our stall at the market and wanted to newline buy a sword . i noticed something in the boy . he could move through space like newline i have been able to . he could jump from point to point via fivedimensional newline space , instead of crawling through threedimensional space like the rest of newline humanity . newline newline i made the blacksmith pretend to be hard of hearing . the boy screamed into the newline man s ear . i slipped into howard s brain . newline newline over the next two years , he learned many things . the images of past deeds newline did nt shock him as much as the other hosts before . sometimes he actively newline reviewed them . most of the time , he was interested in politics , strategy , and newline the proper use of his powers . then , people around him began to die . newline newline some fell down the stairs . some were kicked by frightened horses . after a newline while howard did nt come out of his room any more . he got his nickname . after newline another year he was king , because there was nobody else left . howard , the newline coward had murdered himself onto the throne . newline newline and he kept killing . he instigated wars , rebellions , uprisings , just to have newline an excuse to go on a killing spree . he wore the same uniform as his men and would newline fight from the front . instead of the open field battles with thousands of men newline on either side , he led small bands of merciless killers into the camps and newline slaughtered the soldiers in their sleep . he had his men waiting for the enemy newline in holes and in trees to kill them when they were on the way to a battle . newline newline his reign ended by a chance hit from an arrow . we just had time to transfer me newline to his son . thus i became heirloom to the kings of sweden and norway . each newline of them would look into my memories and take improvements to their powers from newline me . some where regular members of their species , some had a few abilities , and newline few had quite some abilities . newline newline my last host , horold , did nt take fivedimensional space well . it made him sick . newline on the other hand , he intuitively understood the three dimensions that i newline experience as time . he used my memories to hone his abilities to see into the newline future . newline newline he saw the war . he saw the slim chances his little country had regardless newline which side they would choose . he saw a handful of futures where his country newline survived . but at what price ... newline newline then an american man with the name allan kay said ,  the best way to predict newline the future is to shape it yourself .  horold began shaping . he took risks . newline sometime he gambled . in the end , he steered his country into the right newline direction . irwin !  newline newline i rolled my eyes . not again . newline newline  i go to put on my cardigan , and what do i find ? a scorpion nestling in the pocket !  newline newline  but is nt she a beaut ? !  newline newline  such a happy little scorpion .  newline newline no matter how many times i heard them , i just could not get used to the banter in this house . did they ever shut up ? newline newline bob poked his head into my room .  well good morning !  he walked in with a broad smile . ugh , i hope he did nt get paint everywhere like last time . newline newline  morning bob ,  i said weakly . i did nt know if i could start the morning with this cheerfulness . newline newline  so sorry about the noise , neighbour .  fred sauntered in now , too . newline newline  crikey ! we did nt mean to wake you , mate !  steve waltzed in carrying , yep , the scorpion . newline newline  morning fellas .  i tried to hide under my blankets . newline newline  today s a busy day !  fred said , going over to my closet and starting to select my clothes . yep , totally khakis and loafers .  you promised me some time in the neighbourhood of make believe !  newline newline  and we need to talk about sloths !  steve was vibrating with energy .  my son just did this outstanding piece on fallon , so now i have to talk about me too !  newline newline i looked at bob .  and i promised you we could paint happy little trees ,  i said meekly . bob smiled happily at me , nodding away . dear lord , could i not get a day of peace ? was there ever a day bob s hair was nt perfection ? it was definitely no on both counts . i was definitely paying for all those times i d wished my life was more like an afternoon tv special . newline newline  well , come on then !  steve urged me .  i have a sloth in the kitchen for you to cuddle and freddie has a puppet set aside for you .  newline newline i perked up .  is it ... is it daniel striped tiger ?  newline newline  absolutely ,  fred smiled , and he shuffled out of the room , keeping his eye on the scorpion now crawling up steve s arm . newline newline i swung my feet out of the bed and looked at bob . newline newline  well , let s go ,  he motioned .  let s get a little crazy in here .  newline newline ah , who was i to fight it ? now , where was my favourite cardigan ...ironically , i could use a beer right now .  alex reached into his navy blue quilted blazer , retrieving a recently opened box of marlboro reds . he drew a cigarette and brought it to his lips , quickly feeling every pocket on his person for his lighter . shit .  newline newline  need a light ?  alex turned , seeing a young man walking towards him , extending his left hand , holding out his lighter for alex to use . newline newline  thanks .  he said with a brief smile as he took the lighter . the silver zippo lighter was clearly worn , taking alex three tries before it lit . newline newline  this is your first time huh ,  the young man ruffled his short blonde hair , smirking at his correct assumption .  i can always tell , newbies are always really stiff and somber . name s chris .  he said , giving alex his right hand to shake . newline newline  alex . does it usually start so late ?  he mumbled , cigarette still between his lips as he shook chris s hand . newline newline  yeah , mrs. h , our usual chairperson , she s a counselor at palmer high so she runs a couple minutes late .  he squinted his light blue eyes , looking out behind alex , who , seeing chris s gaze was concentrated on something behind him , turned around .  that s her right now actually ! let s go .  the two walked into the small building behind the church , a large single room , most likely used to teach the small children on sundays . in the center of the room , there was a semicircle of chairs formed around one . little by little people starting wandering in , some familiar to the sight and others , like alex , slightly taken aback by their own presence there . newline newline when everyone settled down , after greeting familiar faces and some introducing themselves to new ones , mrs. h began the meeting by reading the alcoholics anonymous preamble . alex was surprised by how little he knew of the procedure . after the preamble , there was a group prayer , followed by the well known serenity prayer , which was also recited by the veterans of the group . it was only when the praying and literature reading was done that the famous part of aa meetings began . it began with a man named eric , who was eight months sober and on the fast track to getting his life back into order . he had struggled to gain the trust of his wife back , but fought tooth and nail to maintain a healthy marriage for his three year old daughter . chris never stopped whispering to alex , telling him the story of every person he knew there . maybe this was a mistake . it does nt seem like the right place .  newline newline  would anyone else like to speak ? chris ?  for the first time since alex met him earlier , chris  face had all the joy and color drained from it . after a deep breath , he pursed his lips in thought , before finally speaking . newline newline  hi guys , my name is chris .  the group responded back with a hello before letting him continue .  i m an alcoholic . i started drinking when i was thirteen . stupid circumstance led to the worst decision of my life . i was trying to be cool and at my first party with high schooler s i had my first beer . ever since then i d been drinking day in and day out , i could nt even brush my teeth in the morning without a couple shots to wake me up . it was nt until i got mrs. h as my counselor during my senior year that i tried getting help . she finally saw through all the shit in my life and all the lies i d set up and suggested i come here . i was sober for 23 months .  suddenly chris closed his eyes , inhaling sharply , clearly trying to hold back tears . newline newline  it s okay chris , you can let it go . you re in a safe place .  she gave him a nod , signaling for him to continue . newline newline  i m so sorry mrs. h ,  tears began to flow down chris  now red cheeks . alex was visibly stunned , suddenly sitting upright in his seat .  i tried so hard not to do it . but  he turned silent for a moment , collecting himself before going on .  but when i saw him just talk about my mom like that . like she was never even a person  like a fuckin  piece of meat that just so happened to now have died on his table . i could nt take it . i threw away my chip and went to noel s bar . i must have had a dozen double jack s . i do nt even remember getting into the car . i do nt even know how i turned it on . i do nt know why i ran that red . all i remember is seeing that woman s face hit my windshield . i still see her everywhere i go .  he wiped his tears with the back of his hand and inhaled quickly through his stuffed nose .  i did nt stop . i just kept going . i could have killed so many other people . when i woke up the next morning , i knew i needed to get help . i turned myself into the police , did my 6 months and community service , and i ve been sober now for 8 months , and i hope to keep that going , one day at a time . thanks guys .  he smiled through his drying tears , sitting back in his chair only to realize alex had left some time in his speech . enraged , chris stood and exited the building . he stopped shortly when he saw alex taking a drag from another cigarette , a tear rolling down his tan face . newline newline  what the hell man ? i was pouring my damn heart out and you do nt give me the common fuckin  courtesy of staying through ?  chris stomped towards alex , aggressively using his hands to emphasize his words . newline newline  it was you .  chris  eyes widened . he froze almost midstride .  you were the drunk driver that killed my wife .  alex s voice was broken , a mixture of seething hatred and sorrow was welling deep within him . chris  mouth gaped open , his left hand soon covered it .  i was waiting for her in the car on the other side of the road . she just wanted to pick up a nice bottle of wine , it was the anniversary of our first date . it was the perfect night , until i saw her body just go limp in a bloody goddamn mess when you hit her .  newline newline  oh my god .  chris could barely muster the three words as he collapsed to the ground . newline newline  i was so mad . i hated you for all those months . i did nt even know what you looked like , but i hated everything about you . my wife , my natalie , the girl i spilled my beer on the first night i met her , the girl i told i would protect with my life . you could nt take me . you could nt have killed me and  and now she s just there , in the ground , she wo nt ever smile again , she wo nt drink my juice in the morning and complain about the bacon i make her being too crunchy , she wo nt tell me her terrible jokes that i laughed at because i loved her . because you took her from me .  alex dropped his cigarette and rubbed it out with the sole of his beige suede shoe . he walked over to chris , still slumped on the ground .  i wanted to kill you , i wanted to kill myself . it took me 6 months to realize she would nt have wanted that , though . as much as i wanted to i realized i could nt hate you . you were nothing to me , i did nt know you had blond hair , i never even looked you in the eyes . the hate i felt was towards myself . it was poisoning me . when i heard the guy that killed natalie got out of prison and was attending aa meetings , i started going all over town . not to find you , not to hurt you in any way , but to give you forgiveness .  alex held out his hand for chris to stand up . newline newline  you  newline newline  no .  alex interrupted .  i ca nt forgive you , not yet . you re just a kid . i know what it s like to lose someone you love and i know how low a person can fall . knowing what you went through , i understand , but i ca nt forgive you . but what these last eight months have made me remember is that ,  alex paused , a genuine smile returning to his face , for the first time since the night his path crossed with chris  .  that natalie would forgive you , because that s who she was . that s why i loved her . and do nt ask me how i know , but , she forgives you chris .  newline newline chris s eyes welled up once more , his jaw clenched as he attempted to hold back his tears . alex placed his left hand on chris  shoulder , offering a silent comfort . newline newline  you showed me how much natalie changed your life , and really , that s all i wanted , what i ve been searching for these past months . i just needed to know her death was nt just a horrible accident in a horrible world . i needed to believe it had meaning . you gave me that faith , chris , and for that i thank you .  alex turned and began to walk away , drawing another cigarette from the box and lighting it . chris remained frozen , silently crying in relief and sorrow . newline newline  i m keeping the lighter .  alex exclaimed , showing it with his right hand as he continued to walk away . chris sniggered as his wiped away his tears and staring up into the early night sky , he saw the clouds giving way to the stars shining down .preface : the power of the gun is that it can be used by anyone with nil experience whereas a skilled bowmen or a skilled swordsman can beat a very high number of unskilled users . newline newline the advent of gunpowderbased weapons did not sweep the world , leading to most of the old world monarchies to remain in power . this highly stifled invention . which in turn led to a lower population rate . the americas was not desolated by explorers bringing germs and guns . without the power of guns , the small number of conquisitors were not able to upheave large settlements such as the aztecs . germs played a smaller portion as the explorers and tobe conquerors did not make it very far inland , mitigating the affects of disease spread . chemical warfare is nearly nonexistent , as they do not distinguish friend from foe . and knowledge about chemical warfare is highly sanctioned and restricted . newline newline the spanish monarchy went bankrupt after funding colonization . the people of spain has since then become a sovereign nation under the flag of the castille , an attempt to unite the people under a common flag . newline newline literacy rates for gradelevel reading is roughly at 60  . most people do not need to know how to read as most of the population are in laborintensive work instead of whitecollar jobs . newline newline steamengine boats and steamtanks are relatively new . the mining of coal has just recently begun less than half a century ago . newline newline     newline newline december 2014 , newline newline another telegram from the colonies overseas . new amsterdam has made a treaty with the five nations . the treaty demands for the evacuation of all civilians back to their respected lands . it looks like the ferocity of the indians has trumped our will to civilize . good riddance . all those taxdollars being poured to fund an impossible mission . i am glad to have that over with , especially when there is another front that needs more attention to . newline newline the ottoman are being rowdy again and are setting up encampments along the danube . the german reich is asking the soereign nations of europe to unite in order to repel against the foreign invaders . the french foreign legionaires have already been committed to fighting the southern front along with the kingdom of castille . most of the fighting is over at the strait of gilbraltar , but raiding parties are all along the shorelines . newline newline the italians , with the assistance of pirate groups , are wrestling against the ottoman for control of the mediterranean sea . the ottoman naval fleet is vast and wield stronger firepower . it is just a matter of time before they take full control of the mediterranean sea , which would be an unfavorable scene for both the italians and pirate groups . no room for corruption among the ottoman . their piety gives them strength . newline newline if the ottoman want to stake claim to any more territory , they must strike now before the navy and armies of the commonwealth are restocked and ready to be redeployed . they must strike soon . and because of so , i must return to training my brigade . newline newline i meander toward the training grounds . walking down the long hall , the faint sound of armored marching men begins to emerge . these are the foot soldiers . they are pushed to the front of the line , to be baptized in blood in the clashing of steel . they wear armor of full steel . they carry a heavy shield and a saber , and alongside they have a dagger and a throwing axe . these men must first learn to lay down their lives before they are trained to fight . newline newline as i turn the corridor , i begin to hear the sound of blunt sabers meeting . these training blades are not sharp , but will still be likely to cut you if you are not attentive . swordsmanship plays a key role . each of these men in the battleground are currently training with one shield , one saber . these people can reign from anyone , from a new recruit to an oldtime veteran . different people have their different weapon choices . the most proven for those are the sword and saber combination . i watch the combatants as they spar each other . the more training they do now , the less likely they will fall victim on the battlefields . they must train and learn to thirst for defeat now so they can survive the battlefield when that time comes . newline newline i comment on the combatants and correct their mistakes before moving onward . i walk away from the main training grounds and go toward the archery range nearby . these archers train not only for precision , but for speed and endurance . they must be able to consitently fire six shots per minute for ten minutes in order to be effective . these bowmen are the backoftheline . they are used mostly to deter cavalary from engaging early on so the footsoldiers have time to writtle down the numbers . cavalry have very light armor in comparison to the footsoldiers , but what they trade off in armor they gain in mobility . they are veteran fighters . horses are few and can be very effective . but horse armor is difficult and expensive , thus armored horses are very unlikely . and if you hit a horse , the rider usually will fall off . i watch as they are given instructions . i approve and continue onward . newline newline next is the special training grounds . this is a regiment that is separate than the rest . they are the best of the best . i watch a few of them duel first . the combatants right now are both utilizing a double attack pattern , both utilizing a dagger in their offhands rather than shields . however , one is using a saber whereas the other a foil . the power of a foil is from lunging . it is good at parying and deflecting , being very mobile . however , it can not kill without a successful lunge , which is difficult to obtain . but a skilled combatant can force an unskilled combatant s hand . these two are going at it with full force , it is looking as if it is a standstill . the foil user is waiting for the saber to make a mistake , so he can capitalize and win . all it takes is a single lunge to end a fight . the saber user is being cautious and defensive , for he knows that it is true . each one of his strike has to be done at the correct moment or he leaves himself open . a strike from a saber , a heavier weapon , takes more time to recover than a foil . and not only that , but a foil has slightly longer reach , so if the saber user goes in without making a critical strike , he is at a great disadvantage . the foiluser knows that he simply needs to be patient . both of these combatants wear very little armor . they protect the back of line archers , making sure they do not get flanked . they have to be mobile to protect them otherwise the cavalary would lay waste . none of them are green . they have already been forged through bloodshed . newline newline there are more intensive combats where it s one versus three or four . you would need high mobility and skill to outwit them , a realtime chess game . one is going on in the courtyard adjacent . the four are highly skilled , but the one is deflecting everything . he is ambidextrous and wields two foils for this . he knows that if he ever gets surrounded at less than a foil range , he will have lost . but he knows that if any one of the four missteps and gets into half a foil range , he could strike at them with a lunge . he has to pay attention to his surroundings . they all do . the four try to pincer him but the lone fighter pushes forward . the other three have to follow suit and remain in the same distance . the lone swordsman does not see an opportunity here , and quickly sidesteps to attack the one formerly to his right . newline newline he restructures himself , backfoot perpendicular to the forward foot . his footwork is extraordinary . the people behind him try to close in on him but he reacts and pushes forward . the four give a look and they in unison and attack . the next instance happens quickly , as the lone man deflects all four of their strikes in simple sequential matter , and then drops the foil in his left hand to grab a dagger from . he strikes at the one he deflected last . he has taken down one of the four . three remain and now he is only holding a foil and a dagger . the fourth man sighs and walks off the field . he knew if he was on the battlefield right now , he would have died . he knows he must train to be better . to be stronger . newline newline i congratulate the man now walking towards me . he seems to cheer up when i remember his name . i console the man to make sure that he knows he needs to become better , and to not only accept this defeat and to make it embolden him instead of destroy him . he understands . i walk off as he watches the remainder of the fight , mentally taking notes on what to do and how to react . newline newline this is the army today . this is how most train day in and day out , every day until there is no more war . but there is always war . i dare not write about the battlefield experience , for those memories are forever stained in my mind as the wounds are forever scarred in my body . i do not like to regale others in those tales . a life , no matter whose it is , is as important as any others . and i do not like counting the number of foes i have slain , or the number of allies that have fallen . but all of them haunt me in my every moment , both awake and in my sleep .the onatol empire did not fall , precisely , but it certainly does not exist in the form it once did , nor does it even claim the name though there is an unbroken line of peaceful succession since the incident of the missing punctuation . the incident , of course , being the incident that lead to the sequence of events that transformed the empire into the democratic republic we know today . newline newline emperor karn vi was known for two things : the loyalty he inspired in his soldiers , and his nearilliteracy . while previous emperors hired aides whose sole job was to transcribe edicts , karn vi was an overly proud emperor , and refused . instead , he taught himself the language , only occasionally dictating that it should behave in the ways he commanded  e.g . our modern use of the pseudoword irregardless  stems from imperial decree that it is , in fact , a word , and means exactly what karn vi meant it to mean  . newline newline his selfeducation was incomplete when it came to punctuation and certain letters , however , which lead eventually to his downfall . his soldiers , always carrying out the meaning of any request sent to them , were equally wary of questioning said orders . so when , during the course of the final expansion war , they were told to  capture men women and children  , they simply captured everyone . newline newline this lead to an enormous expansion of the empire . without any place to actually store the captives , it was shortly decided that they would be returned to their homes , and then those homes would be declared official pow camps of the empire . newline newline the empire s treatment of prisoners of war was not , by current standards , all that great , but it was revolutionary for its time . it was , in fact , a great deal better than the subsistencelevel living that the prisoners were accustomed to . this , in addition to the fact that they technically already inhabited imperiallycontrolled land , lead to unprecedented defection to the empire . newline newline the population of the onatol increased tenfold over the course of the war . in the last decade of official military action , in fact , there were very few casualties at all from the war itself . most opposition either surrendered immediately or overthrew its existing hardliners before the army s arrival and then surrendered . newline newline finally , in 858 a.w. , emperor karn vi issued a decree via radio that he  want  ed  this war over  , and peace was made . on the issue of the newcomers , who now vastly outnumbered the natives of the empire , the decree was  live in our land with our own people  his vast generosity was reflected in the people , and the empire flourished . newline newline over time , of course , there was discontent . the outer reaches of the empire felt distant and unrepresented . emperor karn viii nearly evicted those firstgeneration newcomers , but he was stayed by the decree of his  at the time  longdead grandfather :  let them be no fighting  finally , karn viii signed into law the imperial acknowledgement of rights , which began the march toward democracy as we know it . newline newline only recently have we discovered , through the notes and letters of personal aides to the emperor , karn vi s true intent toward the people who would become his . his ongoing misuse of punctuation and inability to remember certain letters became obvious at this point , and sadly it reflects poorly on the man we once hailed as a hero . newline newline  capture men women and children !  was in fact a dictate to his armies . in a rather egalitarian move , the imperial armies employed women along with men , and of course like every army of any size , considerable numbers of child soldiers . his intention was , then ,  capture , men women and children !  instructing his soldiers to capture , in general , not to capture absolutely everyone they found . newline newline his famous radio decree that he wanted the war over ? the emperor did not understand radio protocol , and included the over  signoff that would normally be included by whoever was reading the decree . the full quote is , thus :  you re asking if i want the war ? i want this war , over !  newline newline the emperor s pride then compounded itself with his unwillingness to admit that he could not remember the letter y  . thus ,  live in our land with our own people  was meant to be an emphatic  live in your land , with your own people .  a xenophobic reaction to a problem he caused in the first place . newline newline and , of course , his legendary edict before he died , the somewhat poorly phrased  let them be no fighting  . this has been interpreted through the ages as either a misspoken  let there be no fighting  or a simple  let them be , no fighting !  the truth , however , is more harsh :  let them be ? no , fighting !  newline newline still , we will always remember emperor karn vi for his works , even if , as it turns out , they were entirely unintentional . for even though he was deeply flawed , he was a greater man accidentally than many are intentionally .godfuckingdamnit , i thought , staring at the advertisement playing across the television . an ominous voice called out ,  tickets now on sale for kevin ward  s return to the stage in his world tour , black magic !  my mind spiraled . i genuinely never thought he would try to do the whole comeback thing . i mean , it  s not exactly an old man  s game  and he is older , has to be knocking on the door of 60 by now . probably looking older than that , given all the drugs he  d been on when he put me on what i have lovingly come to call the comeback contract . no peeps from this prick since he put me on his contract and essentially funded my retirement 10 years ago . the ad continued , showing ward escaping a set of handcuffs with his arms behind his back . yeah , confirmed . 60 , minimum . my eyes swung over towards the kitchen , to the pills i had been hoarding for years . running slightly ahead of my routine checkin to

as hell , though . besides , i  m here to kill someone , not see the sights . the room at caesar  s palace was nice , and the flight was alright . flying restricted my options for how i could do the deed and left poison as the only palatable option . guns were nearly always my method of choice , preretirement . the thought hit me like a train  i hadn  t actually been to this rodeo for 10 years . to think that this , killing people for money , used to be my day in , day outwhereas now , it  s pretty much all day in . on the couch . don  t lose your nerve . there  s a 1mil bonus at fulfillment of this contract . you can live on that . no killing , no outside . back to the couch .  i steeled my nerves and dressed in the all black ensemble intended to make me fit in with his stage crew . now to find a badge .  newline newline getting in wasn  t hard . same old trick i  ve pulled before  wander around aimlessly near the entrance , look lost , maybe a little glistening tear in my eye . some

name badge nicked from the sign in table said . in and out . no sticking around . i wandered around , looking for ward  s dressing room . i noticed a kitchen and popped in , located a glass , popped out my dropper and put the tiniest bit into the glass before filling it with water . the stuff was tasteless and colorless , and would not require him to drink the full glass . it was , however , somewhat slow acting . perfect . newline newline after stumbling around the halls for a bit  apparently the gold star on the performer  s room thing is just in the movies  i located ward  s room and

cabinet disappearing . ward swung the cabinet door open and raised his hands in an  aha !  gesture . the assistant laid limp and lifeless inside the cupboard . well , shit . that was a first . where were those pills ... august 27 2017 newline newline  jhon ! jhon wake up !  i awoke to the voice of my brother ,  jhon wake up !  my brother knocked on the door to my room loudly , i opened my eyes . the room was dark , humid and had a musty smell there were no windows just concrete walls and floors ,  jhon wake up already , we re going to miss breakfast and all the good stuff will be taken !  i sighed and grunting said  alright already i m up i m up  . i turned on the small lamp on the table next to my bed , i grabbed my glasses and quickly put on my pants and shirt laying on the floor . newline i opened the door the steel door with my brother waiting impatiently for me , his dark hair greasy from not taking a shower , his face sweaty and skinny he was only wearing a white tshirt and his pants were rugged which made his skinny body look weak and frail . my brother stayed on the floor below me since he was not one of the workers but a family member but he always came to get me whenever food was served . i was a electrician working on the ships that are humanity s last hope at a new life . newline newline  let s go let s go !  he said hurriedly  okay let s go calm down  . we went down the stairs and then walked to the other side of the building , as we walked down the dimly lit corridor we saw other already waking uo aswell . once we got to the cafeteria we saw others getting in line and rushing to find a seat , we quickly rushed to get a plate of food . it was a choice between some oatmeal , chopped fruit a small bread and a baked potato or a bowl of cereal with an apple and orange with a small granola bar for later , i choose the oatmeal . we then walked over to a semi empty table and one of us sat down while the other one when to get drinks . i was the one to get the drinks this time while my brother saved my seat . while i was walking to the drink station a small child carrying a bowl of oatmeal tripped and spilled her food on the floor , her mother quickly put her bowl of food on the table and picked up the child to stop her from crying , i walked around the spilled oatmeal and kept walking . newline newline as i walked over to the drinks station the sirens started to wail , i quickly looked back to find my brother frozen still looking down at his food . the speaker then turned on and announced the following message  to all personal and family members the big one is here ! i repeat the big one is here !  the big one ... the storm to end all life as we know it  quickly gather only your important belongings and make your way to the nearest launch station ! this is not a drill ! i repeat this is not a drill !  the announcer yelled loudly . the storm was reaching us earlier then expected and not all ships were ready to launch and i knew this , no everyone knew this and as i looked around me i noticed the cafeteria was silent . and suddenly the first person got up and started running and quickly everyone else followed suit , i started to walk fast towards my brother who noticed so he got his bowl of cereal that he choose and made his way towards me . newline newline  jhon !  my brother screamed . as we were about to meet up i slipped on the oatmeal that had been spilt i hit my head on the concrete floor full force , i passed out momentarily waking up with my back on the floor i saw my brother over me trying to lift me up , i stood up and fixed my glasses when i noticed the cafeteria was almost empty , everyone was rushing to their rooms to gather their belongings  jhon , jhon ! are you ok ?  my brother who looked like he was about to panic said .  i m fine , i m alright i just slipped is all  i said  how are you alright ! ? your bleeding from the back of your head !  my brother screamed . i touched the back of my head on the left side with my right arm crossing my chest , i quickly felt pain and moved my hand back to see it covered in blood .  it s just a cut do nt worry rick  i told my brother in a low voice as not to make him panic .  we need to gather our belongings quickly and get on one of the rockets , rick i need you to quickly gather your things and get on one of those rockets ok ! ? do nt wait for me to finish packing , as soon as your done i need to to get to a ship as quickly as possible , ok !  newline  yes jhon !  he said . we quickly made our way to our rooms my brother made it to his first , and i made my way up the stairs since the elevators were full . once i made it to my room i started packing my belongings and tools for my job , but i started to black out i must have gotten a concusion when i fell . i stood up and picked up my belongings trying to walk it off for the moment , i walked out of my room and out to the hallway and saw my brother near the stairs . he had come for me even when i told him not to .  jhon let s go we do nt want to get left behind !  he yelled .  ok , let s go  i told him , and we made our way downstairs and past the corridor our the building and ran to the closest launching station we could find , that s when i looked back and saw it , the storm . clouds of ash and fire , making the sky a dark red and orange with the land below it being covered by its massive shadow and rain of fire . newline newline i walked inside with my brother to see alot of people waiting in line to get into the ship .  alright we got enough space for 100 people in the ship we need 33 more  a man said . i looked at my brother and told him  rick i want you to get on this shuttle no mater what ok ! ? even if i ca nt make it in do nt worry i ll get on the next one closest to us , so do nt worry i ll be fine   ok , ok jhon i will , promise me you will get on another ship if not this one  he said .  i promise  i told him . the man let people into the shuttle one by and finally it was our turn my brother went in and as i was about to go in i looked back as saw the younge child and her mother behind me , i decided to let them go in first ahead of me and as i was about to walk in the man stopped me  sorry ... theirs no more room in this shuttle , your going to have to go to another one  i looked at him for a second but grabbed my stuff and started running to another shuttle , with the people behind me in line doing the same . as i was made my way out through the corridor i once again started to black out , but this time i lost my balance hit the floor and passed out . newline when i came to i had a massive headache and could hardly move but i managed to stand up and looked around me . it was silent or at least it was inside i could hear the rumbling of the storm outside , at first i did not realise what had happened but once i cleared my head i ran to the door to go outside , but it was locked , so i made my way up to another level with a window and saw that the storm had long since covered the entire launching stations , but most off all all the ships had already departed . i was left behind ... newline newline i am now the last man on earth , or at least i think i am . newline newline the launching station that i am in had already been cleared , but how was i left behind ? did they not see me laying on the floor passed out ? did they not care ? no , the most likely thing that happened is that the other workers took a diffrent exit or got on the ship with the rest of the passengers , their seats were probably already reserved for them so they would not have walked back to were i was . i was now locked inside of this place but i was not panicking and not feeling sorry for myself , the only thing i can feel  is this fucking gash in the back of my head , fuck !  newlinei am decaying . i lift up my shirt and my stomach is blue , butterflies hover around me kissing me gently on the shoulder as if trying to comfort me . i did nt need comforting . i was sitting on a field of perfectly maintained grass in a large white room . the room was brightly lit with ambiguous light from the window . newline newline from behind me a white tiger , so skinny i could see it s ribs came up and carried me to the center of the room . there i lied down , and i looked again at my stomach and i knew this was the end of my life . no matter how long you live whether it be 1000 years or 10 the only thought that goes through your mind is  i want more time  . newline newline i felt a lifting sensation , where my consciousness was lifted out of me not faded . slowly i lifted out of my body and then nothing . not darkness ... just nothing . newline newline then i woke up in real life , as if i passed away from the dream and the soul manifested in this reality .jim pinched his nose and itched at his ragged beard . mike stared . newline newline  look , just ... let s see the money .  newline newline  i want to see the product first ,  replied jim , eyes still closed . newline newline  you know , i m starting to think ... .  newline newline jim snapped his head up and stared . newline newline  think what ?  he growled . newline newline  i do nt know , something . you re acting strange . this is how this works , these drug deals . you pay for the product first .  newline newline both men shifted in their seats . newline newline jim flicked at his nose like he s seen so many coke heads do across dusty tables back at the station . he cleared his throat . they did that all the time , right ? newline newline mike sat as a dealer would sit . newline newline the confiscated police funds sat in a neat stack in jim s sweaty pocket and mike s baggie with a pinch of 23 years lay impatiently in the drawer next to him . newline newline unbeknownst to one another , they shared a collective thought at the exact same moment :  fuck it , there s no recording of this deal . i m going to arrest his ass and find the goods .  newline newline they both smirked and motioned for their pockets . newline newline  what the fuck ! do nt move ,  snarled mike . newline newline  you do nt move first ,  replied jim . newline newline  ok , i wo nt move first then you wo nt move .  newline newline  so i get the first move ?  asked jim with a smirk . newline newline  shit , i guess so .  newline newline in a swift motion , jim whipped out his .38 special and slapped the butt across mike s sweaty temple with a dull thud . newline newline mike cried out and reached for his pocket but jim s knee landed heavily on his wrist , snapping it in three places . he lay in defeat . newline newline jim pulled a ziptie out of his pocket and expertly bound mike s wrists . newline newline  you re under arrest ,

know a hole from their ass in the ground .  newline newline  save your political babblings for a jury that wo nt give a fuck .  newline newline  you stupid fuck , i m dea . check my wallet .  newline newline jim fumbled in his pocket with one hand without breaking his pistol s focused gaze between mike s eyes . newline newline  it could be worse ,  said mike ,  you could look like a fucking moron and have a concussion and broken wrist .  newline newline jim saw the bad news and dropped the wallet on mike s chest . newline newline  say , let s go find a scumbag and plant this shit on them so we

load of guys on my training who are awesome and i think that they will be good friends of mine until the day i die , which hopefully wo nt be any time soon because there are nt any wars at the moment

and did nothing but my job . my children wo nt talk to me or even let me see my grand children . newline newline i decided to read the entry i made when passing my basic training back in 2017 , when i was but a fresh faced 18 year old who wanted to fight for what he believed in , freedom and glory . well over the year i ve found out that they did nt exist , i ve been at riots what i was given a kill order , and i ve looked into the eyes of young boys as i shot them in front of their fathers . what i ve done with my life is nt fight for freedom and glory , what i ve done if kill for fear and power . newline newline all the friends that i said i made on basic training , they all died about six months later when out base was bombed , me and one other soldier survived . she was my first wife , the one who left 10 years later because of my drinking . after the base bombing , i decided not to make friends with my soldier , not to get attached to any of them . after than i became a brilliant soldier , and was asked to join the s.a.s . as just a sargent . newline newline i wish that i could write down what i did in the s.a.s . but i know that if i did , and someone found out i would be locked away , and most likely shot the next day , and although i hate my life , i think i will keep it for now . although i ca nt say exactly what i did , i can say i m not proud of most of it . newline newline when i became an officer , i became the one who was the worst to everyone , the kind who is talked about behind his back as a butcher and who thinks of soldiers as cannon fodder , but when is talked to is told that i m a hero and brave officer who does what it takes to win . the truth of the matter is that i do nt care about those small people , which i know is bad , but i do what i can to win  if that means that i have to kill a hundred young soldiers then so be it , i kill them in the name of winning . newline newline the worst part of it all is that i read through every letter that is sent to the parents of the dead soldiers and have to sign and write that  he was a good soldier , and will be dearly missed by every single on of us , lieutenantmajor james gunner .  i do nt know any of those boys who i kill , like i said , i lean not to . newline newline i guess that this is where i stop , this is where i sit down in my arm chair and drink myself to death , or take an overdose of prescription medication . i would , but now i m out of the army , i can allow myself to feel , and i can now morn the boys that i ve killed , on our side at least , getting names of the people that i ve killed is almost impossible , especially from isis ... sorry , the islamic state , and the taliban . newline newline i m now going to read every name of every soldier that i ve killed

attempt to tame my unruly hair . i stopped a sigh from escaping  she had done so much for this day . instead , i tugged her skirt gently . newline newline  what if ...  i mouthed . newline newline  you would nt know , would you ?  she replied , tugging the piece of hair she held downward .  ow !  i squealed indignantly .  i m sorry .  she mouthed and continued fussing with my hair . newline newline i fidgeted and flexed my stocking covered toes .  i would know  i thought to myself . my face was smothered with paints , powders , and pigments whilst my eyes were an odd shade of yellow and green  i still was nt accustomed to the contacts my mother had picked out and it felt strange to be without my spectacles . newline newline  i want people to see your beautiful eyes .  my mother repeated incessantly at the optometrist , insisting that i bought several pairs of different coloured contacts to match the clothes we picked up . we had been visiting all the shops that day to purchase makeup , clothing , shoes and every other unnecessary thing the salespeople pushed onto her , for my sake . newline newline i swore that my debit cards felt physically lighter after that shopping spree . newline newline  be careful when you put the dress on , you do nt want to ruin the hair and makeup . i hope you choose the black one , the one that makes you look like you ve lost 5 kilos .  my mother said excitedly . i nodded and glanced at the dresses she arranged on bed , each pressed to perfection . newline newline  there .  she said and i glanced at my reflection . i looked ... like my mother s daughter . newline newline  you look beautiful .  my mother gasped , wiping tears off her eyes .  if he does nt fall in love with you , he s a fool .  newline newline i swallowed hard and stared at my reflection . my mother busied around the room momentarily before exiting the room . i noticed that the black dress was placed slightly away from the rest . newline newline two hours later , i arrived at the party . three hours later , i stood awkwardly at the side of the room , staring at the many people mingling , dancing , and drinking all around me . every now and then , everyone would momentarily be stunned and two more people would slowly walk towards each other and spend the rest of the night huddled in the corner , whilst the rest of the room watched them . newline newline the click , the sound of soulmates being matched . it was a particularly successful night with over 5 couples matched within the first hour  since the matchmaking company i worked for held the last successful party , their event has been the party of the year filled with singles hoping to meet the click . it s the only thing anyone could talk about for the past three months . newline newline the elusive click was an unknown concept to me  i had all but given up until i met him . if he was nt my soulmate , i did nt know what else it could be . from the moment we met to now , he had slowly invaded every part of my mind and memory . he was the one for me , as far as i was concerned . newline newline i waited in the sidelines , concentrating on my beverage whilst repeating a silent prayer for the familiar face . he was late , as usual . newline newline it was another hour before i felt a shadow looming over me . i turned only to find him poised , seconds away from jumping on me . i gave him a grin . newline newline  i swear , you ca nt be deaf . you always catch me before i get you .  he chuckled before giving me a once over  gosh , you look so different . what did you do to my friend ? where re your trusty glasses ?  newline newline i forced a smile and shrugged , feeling a lump form in my throat .  it s my mum . she s a hairdresser , you know .  i said .  um . i thought ... you know . i should look good if i meet someone .  newline newline he nodded cautiously , sipping his drink .  you look uncomfortable .  newline newline  oh .  i said , feeling my stomach tighten .  well . i am ... not ... used to large crowds .  i stuttered in reply before taking a gulp of liquid courage .  are you enjoying the party ?  newline newline he made a face and placed the glass on a nearby table , mouthing  same old . i heard that many people met up with soulmates last year . just thought i d try this year , yknow .  newline newline he ended with a sigh .  i turned 40 yesterday .  newline newline i nodded and bit my lip . how was i going to tell him that i liked him and that we should be with each other . forget the hyped concept of soulmates or the fact that it was our jobs to model how the phenomenon occurred . newline newline  i m sure you ll find someone . she does nt need to be a soulmate . i mean , perhaps the whole concept of soulmates is a little outdated ... my parents are nt soulmates ...  i trailed nervously . newline newline he seemed to just stand there , looking away . we stood beside each other for what felt like a good ten minutes before he stepped forward and grabbed my wrist . newline newline my heart skipped a beat the moment i felt his hand and the noise ceased  his fingers were surprisingly callused and his grip was firm . he took a step closer and i could smell him  the scent of my daydreams . my eyes met his shocked face . newline newline  i heard it . i heard a click . my click .  he said , his eyes wide . i felt my lips part . my knees shook . my eyes widened . was it something i said ? this was too good to be ... newline newline  i think she s on the other side of the room .  newline newline my head fell and the lump in my throat threatened to suffocate me . newline newline  oh my god . i see her . i see her . i hear it . the click .  newline newline every eye in the room was on me and him .  go .  i whispered .  go . everyone s ...  newline newline as quickly as he entered my space , he left , walking hurriedly towards the other side of the room . i gripped the table i stood by . my eyes watered and i did my best to keep them down and not let it ruin the work my mother had put hours into . my vision grew cloudy as i moved to the corner , trying to gauge the exit . newline newline my hands reached into my purse and grabbed a blotting paper , carefully removing traces of tears from my eyeball . i took a deep breath and turned . newline newline despite my poor vision , i could see his outline in the distance huddled over a woman clad in red . i fished my spectacles out and put it on . his eyes were soft yet intense  he was looking at her as if he wanted to drink in every detail about her . their hands were intertwined and i felt his phantom touch on mine . his head bowed slightly to catch her words , his eyes crinkled as he smiled the smile i had memorised and replayed in my head for the past year . newline newline my eyes reluctantly moved to her and i felt the strongest pang of jealousy .  it was supposed to be me ,  i thought to myself . she looked as enamoured , her face glowing in the dimmed room , her lips moving to say the words  i ca nt believe i ve never met you .  newline newline  i know , it s crazy . i ve worked in this building for three years ... i. wow . i did nt think the click would happen to me . was it real ?  she went on . newline newline  yes . you re perfect ...  i saw his lips say before they descended on hers . newline newline i felt every part of my body tense and the deepest hush swept over my body . at that moment , i acquainted with the mental torment i d later know as heartbreak . i d never be physically able to hear the sound of meeting a soulmate but the silence of heartbreak was too familiar a friend . newline newline click . newline newlinethis is it , a typical thursday night . the clock staring at me from across the empty tavern , ticking away and weaving with the low music in the background . i drum my fingers against the wooden surface at the bar and i look down at my legs , sore from standing for hours on end . newline newline my phone vibrates in my pocket and i pull it out quickly , looking at the time again . had it really only been 2 minutes since i last checked ? i look at the clock on the wall , then back to the phone and exhale . i check who the text is from , and i smile . even with something as simple as  how s work ?  i can tell that she cares . newline newline i send her a quick reply , keeping her in mind as i tuck the phone away , straighten my back and stretch . i can definitely survive the night if i know she ll be there when i get back .he sat on a stone slab , surrounded on three sides by stone walls , separated from the other inmate  s cells by thick iron bars . the ceiling and floor were made of the same bleak grey stone , and there was just enough room for him to stand up straight . his considerable height and bulk made this place quite cramped . he  d woken up a short while ago , to sunlight streaming in through a small crack in the wall opposite of the bars . he scratched a mark onto the wall with a small rock . twenty one days . three weeks in this place . out of habit , he peeked through the crack in the wall . he saw nothing beyond but blue skies and some clouds . a bit of wind chilled him as it whistled through the gap . wherever this was , it was high up . newline newline his name was aiden kell . that much he remembered . before that i  d had a few drinks . got into a fight . figured it was best to ride out of town before sunset . i made it out past the gate and then kell  s head hurt . couldn  t remember much . he felt around with his fingers , took a look at the results . still a big sore spot back there , but at least the bleeding had stopped . newline newline first part of the day was breakfast . a ghostly apparation that was vaguely shaped like a human moved from cell to cell and set a bowl of bread and fruit in front of each , just far enough away that one prisoner couldn  t grab the food of another . it went away , then made another round with jugs of water . for a prison , this place kept it  s populace well fed . aiden had given up trying to talk to the spiritthing after the first few days . it didn  t seem to have a mouth , or be capable of doing anything other than it  s pattern . some kind of magic , he figured . newline newline after that , it was a matter of waiting until free time when the bars disappeared . some days they didn  t . at first , aiden tried to talk to the other prisoners across from him . he  d gotten nowhere with that as well . he  d mentally named them slick , big joe , and crawly , as they refused to introduce themselves , or speak at all . whenever he spoke to slick , he  d crawl back to the furtherest corner away from aiden and start gibbering and pawing at the wall . big joe wasn  t all there . he ate his food , sat on the bed . didn  t respond to much else . he didn  t even go wander around during free time . crawly was the most vocal of them all . any attempt at communication , or eye contact caused crawly to curl up under his bed and go into a crying fit . newline newline lot of waiting in prison . aiden did his best not to think about why he was here . what he  d done . he  d tried plenty already , and all it did was make his head ache harder . he laid down on his bed after he finished his food , and waited till free time . newline newline aiden felt his ears pop , he looked up to find the bars to his cell , and those of the other inmates had disappeared . free time as usual . he didn  t have long . he got up and bounded into the hall . ran back and forth , looking for new faces . anyone who might talk to him . he hopes were dashed as he realized that the population in this wing had been reduced to just him , big joe , crawly , and slick . he ignored them and headed for the common room . newline newline the common room was where all the wings of the prison emptied out . a big green field open to the sky with a few trees and picnic tables . it was colder than fuck out here , but it was better than staying put in the cells . plus , the tables always had fine food on them . aiden made sure he got out there among the first . nobody challenged him as he took a seat at one of the tables , and got to work on eating his fill . newline newline the other tables not so much . the inmates always fought . slick slid through the struggle and made away with some fruit . aiden knew he  d be sneaking some of that back to big joe . he  d seen it happen every day . twenty one days . crawly took up whatever scraps got knocked his way in the scuffle . newline newline today it looked like things were going to get too out of hand . someone had managed to find or make a stone knife , and applied it to another inmate  s stomach . aiden watched and ate his food from his empty table as the guards , looking pristine and angelic in their pure white robes , floated down from above the walls of the commons . he decided maybe it was time to talk to one of them . he grabbed an empty wooden mug , and strode over to the nearest one quick enough to block his way . the rest moved in toward the brawling inmates to break them up . newline newline  hey . what am i in for ?  , aiden said . newline newline the guard just stared back blankly , sun reflecting off of his shaved head . after a few seconds he shook his head , as though he didn  t know . or maybe couldn  t say . newline newline  well , i  m not too partial to being here . let me go ?  newline newline the guard shrugged , and tried to move around aiden . aiden decided it was time for action , and grabbed the guard on the shoulder with one hand , brought the mug down on his head with the other hand .  tell me why i  m here !  , aiden shouted . newline newline there was no other noise in the yard . everyone else had stopped , gone silent . all of them , inmates and guards , were staring at aiden . some looked scared , others , aiden couldn  t tell . the guards all had the same expression . inhuman apathy . the guard , whom aiden held now by the robe in one hand looked down and away , blood streaming from a gash above his eye where the mug had connected . he spoke .  they  ll kill me for this . i  ve already failed . please , have mercy , finish me.  newline newline  what the fuck ? no . show me the way out of here.  , aiden said . newline newline  there are only two ways  , the guard whispered ,  death , or the pits . that door . go before the warden comes.  newline newline aiden saw a door along the wall , where there had not been a door before . it was made of the same stone as the wall , other than it  s featureless wooden pull ring . the commons yard still remained eerily silent . nobody reacted , as though the guard hadn  t spoken at all . aiden dropped the guard and strode over to the inmate with the stone knife . he stuck out his open palm .  give me that.  the inmate dropped it in aiden  s hand and ran away , shaking with terror . newline newline aiden opened the door , looked back . he saw slick , and waved . then he turned and strode across the threshold , and the door slammed shut behind him . in the dim torchlight , he saw a crumbling spiral staircase that ran around the edge of a wide , wide pit , and descended into inky blackness . aiden pushed a small rock over the edge with the toe of his boot . he didn  t hear it hit bottom . he gripped the knife in one hand , and placed his other hand on the wall to steady himself and began his descent into the pit . as he went deeper , inhuman sounds , screams , undulating cries , screeching and scratching , assailed his ears . it sounded like nothing he  d ever heard before . above him , light streamed in as someone else opened the door .  aiden ! go back to your cell . this is the warden.  newline newline a terrible creature the warden was . his skin was green scales , he sported two extra arms , and had great tusks , like a boar . he held slick , who  s struggles to escape the warden  s grasp where in vain .  aiden ! obey me !  , the warden cried , as he hurled slick down into the pit . he screamed as he flew down past aiden . aiden gripped his knife and kept moving down the stairs as the warden plodded down the stairs in a leisurely and confident pursuit . he would have to decide soon whether to throw caution to the wind and run down the stairs , or turn and face the warden .i ran into the room , knowing i d have to be perfect if i was going to make it out of here alive . probability of death 90  . damn chip newline newline with the heavy weight slung

door . the closet door .  newline newline i lay motionless in bed for a moment , trying to comprehend the possibility that my senses were beginning to fail me  inevitably , room location is the first piece of sanity to go as you age . i began to worry that the washroom i stumbled into last night and obliterated with a johnny walker bowel movement was , in all likelihood , the kitchen . newline newline the knock came again , just as courteous and concise as its first appearance . i propped myself up in bed , and shook my head while simultaneously rubbing my face to sober up for whatever i was about to experience . newline newline  ugh ... come in ,  i mumbled . newline newline the closet door slowly creaked open , and a short figure wearing a suit two sizes too small and a white face cloth taped to its face slowly emerged , allowing half of its body to protrude from the now open closet door . it froze , and stared at me , watching me gaze through the darkened room . newline newline  goddamn it mickey go home , i m drunk ,  i groaned falling back onto the bed ,  i am not in the mood for any sort of ridiculous slenderman nonsense on a saturday morning .  newline newline  it s actually phantom of the opera ,  he replied ,  i did nt have the right socks for the slenderman costume .  newline newline  phantom of the ... look . just go away ,  i said as i retreated under the covers ,  how did you manage to get in my closet for this anyway ? my bedroom was locked  newline newline  only after you got home ,  he howled in a pseudoghost voice , waving his arms and fingers at me as he sidestepped to my bedroom door and left . newline newline mickey , admittedly , was not the most clever roommate i had ever lived with . but to his credit , he was dedicated to his pranks . newline newline please , sit down .  newline newline in the doorway of the small room stood a humanoid synthetic , modeled to resemble a human being as closely as possible . made with the newest 3d printing technology , its features were close enough to pass for human to anything but the most scrutinizing eye . motors in the machine s face and body controlled what muscles would control in a human form , allowing for completely expressive facial expressions and a full range of motion . at the request , the unit  this model resembling a young , good looking man  sat at the far end of the table . he slowly raised its arms and put them on the table . newline newline at the other end of the table sat a tall , thin man , looking to be about in his 50 s , dark hair with just a peek of grey at the temples to show his age . he wore a button up shirt with a coffee stain below the breast pocket . he sat among piles of notes , strategically placed between empty coffee cups and take out boxes . in between his nicotinestained fingers he held a folder that contained documents detailing the model , serial number , and date of manufacture of his various interviewees . the highest number that was nt crossed out was that of his current candidate . this particular unit had also been given a name . jack . newline newline  good evening , jack . my name is dr. sam talbert , and i m here today to ask you a few questions . how are you today ?  newline newline  i am well , thank you for asking , dr . talbert .  newline newline  do you know why you ve been asked to speak with me ?  newline  no .  if he did  any sam knew if he did nt he d have no way of knowing otherwise  jack did nt show it . newline newline  i see . are you aware of the rising tension around the world ? between organics and synthetics ?  newline  yes .  newline newline  good . my colleagues and i are of the opinion that many of the issues that are causing strife between us could be solved with a mutual understanding and dialogue . the purpose of this particular interview is  hopefully  to teach you some preliminary skills to help you interact with humans . shall we begin ?  newline newline  yes . am i going to be killed after this interview ? i have heard rumors of others being killed for disagreeing with their interviewers .  newline newline dr. talbert stiffened , but quickly caught himself and corrected the reaction . the rumor was true  synthetics that were deemed to be extremists or those that were not receptive to peaceful dialogue were quietly deactivated . that the synthetics were calling this being  killed  was not news to him , but it was also not something he was yet used to hearing . newline newline  no , no , nothing like that . we are simply trying to be proactive and get ahead of the issues between us . have you had the opportunity to interact with many humans ?   i have not . i was born 9 months ago in ecuador and was immediately assigned to work here in the north american shipping port . i specialize in the repair of commercial atmospheric shipping drones . only two humans work in my department .  newline newline  i see . have you had any issues with these individuals ?  newline newline  no .  newline newline  good . jack , do you think you understand humans ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  why ?  newline newline  humans differ from us only in that they sleep and breathe and eat differently than we do . i understand myself and other synthetics so it is not a large logical leap to assume that i would understand most humans .  newline newline  i see . do you have any feelings toward any humans ?  dr. talbert knew that true artificial intelligence  true feeling and emotion  was still far beyond the means of the current technological landscape . but he also knew that some synthetics claimed to empathize or feel emotion towards others . additionally , most synthetics had at least some lowlevel replacement for true emotion coded into their operating system . newline newline  no . while i am able to express a facsimile of emotion toward others , that is a benefit for humans , who rely on such responses . i do not use that information for anything other than communication with them .  newline newline dr. talbert set his folder down on the table . he pulled a halfempty pack of cigarettes out of his breast pocket and lit one . he took a drag from it and settled it between his fingers . he waited a long moment , then exhaled the smoke slowly . newline newline  in a lot of ways , you and other synthetics are better than us . you are more efficient than us , live longer than us , and solve problems faster than us . and you re getting better at it every day . people do nt like being shown how small they are , and synthetics do it without even thinking about it .  dr. talbert drummed the fingers of the hand not holding his cigarette on the metal tabletop .  in a word , people feel threatened . by the very people we helped create .  newline newline  do you feel that way , dr . talbert ?  the machine stared at him with implacable eyes . the machine stared intently at the interviewer , seemingly confused why it took more than a few seconds for the man to respond . newline newline  sometimes . do you ever feel jealous of humans ? we feel emotion , fall in love , have children , and can do a lot of things synthetics have yet to accomplish .  newline newline  the things you describe seem not to be advantageous for any reason .  newline newline  that is precisely what causes friction between organic and synthetic life , jack . i work harder for this world because i love my children and i want to make it a better place for them . i help others because i empathize with their struggles and understand the human condition . many people fear you because you lack the ability to do the same . you work faster than we do , but you do it because that s what you were born to do .  newline newline  i am able to present emotions that are statistically indistinguishable from genuine feeling in a laboratory setting . is that not enough ?  newline newline  not if the people you show it to outside of the lab do nt buy it . it does nt mean anything to them . and they re the people out there scared enough to put us where we are right now .  newline newline  then what can i do ? i work exactly as i was designed to work with my human counterparts . i have worked successfully with humans and have had no incidents with them .  newline newline  i can see that , jack . you have a better record than most that i ve talked to today . which is why i do nt think we ll need to put you through any further questions . i have some brief materials that i d like to send you off with . i ll see you once more in a month and after that you wo nt hear any more from us . just a bit of homework for you .  newline newline dr. talbert brushed a stack of papers aside to reveal a small communication system sitting on the table . he pulled it over to himself and pressed a small , blue button on the bottom of its display panel . newline newline a moment later , a short young woman walked in carrying a stack of books , papers , and a few media drives . she set the stack on the desk and quickly left the room , closing the door behind her . newline newline  the classics . shakespeare , tolstoy , beethoven , da vinci , you name it . literature and music and art , compiled from a list of artistic works that our team has determined most accurately projects the human condition  . i d like you to review these materials and write down your thoughts on them . when you re done , you ll come back and we ll discuss them briefly .  dr. talbert stood and walked the few paces to stand next to jack . newline newline  of course , dr . talbert .  jack rose and grasped dr. talbert s proffered hand . dr. talbert put his hand on jack s shoulder and led him to the door . newline newline  it was good talking to you , jack . enjoy the rest of your day .  with that , sam waved once more and pulled the door shut . he sat down , took another drag of his cigarette , and picked up his folder . he took a pen and crossed jack s number out of the list . next to it he wrote  reevaluate in one month , materials supplied .  it was slow work , but tensions were slowly leveling off . the material was working . they d get there . hi mom  newline newline her expression did nt change . it was nt likely to , i suppose . after all , it had nt changed much when she was alive , why should it now that she was dead ? i held my breath for a moment , then exhaled . briefly , the mirror she occupied grew foggy , and obscured the stern countenance i had grown accustomed to in my youth . i was twenty two now , and though it had been years since i had last seen her face i could recount every stern wrinkle and frown line that defined her . newline newline she d been pretty once , before she stopped smiling , with long golden brown hair that seemed to shine even when the sunlight was absent . in those days , she wore long sundresses and sandals , no matter the weather . at times she made winter warm with her smile . newline newline at least , that s how my father would described her . newline newline i remember another woman . a woman who had never smiled , and who s face would put a gargoyle to shame and leave scarecrows looking for other work . we agreed on the sundresses though . newline newline  what are you doing here mother ?  newline she did nt answer . to be honest , i did nt expect her to . she had always wanted others to work out what she wanted , i guess this time was to be no different . newline newline  did you forget something ?  newline newline her face twitched , much like a statue does nt . newline newline  have you come to apologize ?  newline newline she inaudibly huffed . her whole body rising and falling . death apparently came with a lack of gravity . newline newline  what then ?  newline newline she looked sternly at me , which is to say she looked at me as her expression never changed . newline newline  i m sorry , but i m completely at a loss on why you would come back .  newline newline she continued to stare . i felt eleven again . blood rushed to my cheeks . newline newline  stop giving me that same damned look . i have nt done anything wrong . i m a grown man now , and i certainly will not be made to feel like a child again by a woman who s been gone for ten years !  newline newline her face lit up , and if it had been anyone else but her , i would have said they were laughing . instead , i knew she was getting angry . i could feel my own blood beginning to boil . i turned from her , set my jaw , and began to march back to my room . she quickly zipped in front of me , putting her arms on her hips . if she could speak , i imagine i d have been getting an earful . i did nt pretend to listen . i walked at her , determined to finish my morning routine . newline newline as soon as i passed through her , she stopped , her jaw closing in midsilent conversation . newline newline  sorry , but i have things i have to do . i do nt have time to listen to the phantom of a woman who ca nt speak to me now , and did nt bother to when she had the chance .  newline newline somehow her lips grew tighter , it was almost comical as the her false flesh nearly formed an equal sign on her face . she began to shake . so did the house . objects began to fall from the walls , books from the bookcases , all forming a veritable commodity graveyard . newline newline  seriously ? !  newline newline she stopped . newline newline  this ? this is what you come back for ? ! to wreck the house ? what , to punish us ? why ? why on earth would you brave whatever hell you came through just to get back and become the same stern looking bitch i remember ? ! newline newline she looked shocked , but i knew it had to be a ploy . i pushed away the wave of guilt , and continued . newline newline  would it have been so much to ask for you to come back just to see us ? no , no . of course , if my mother is going to brave heaven or hell s or whatever s wraith , it s just so she accommodate whatever request she did nt feel was completed to vindicate her soul . so what is it , mom ? what did you need to hear me say just so you could live contentedly in the afterlife ?  newline newline she was stunned . her frozen countenance had been pushed aside , and replaced with one of abject horror . then she cried . big heavy sobs that wracked her whole body . i might have smiled if i had nt felt so angry . yet , as she continued , the guilt came back . slowly , and creeping . but back none the less . i sat down beside the grieving ghost . she wrapped translucent arms around me . i did nt feel them , but i tried to the return the gesture . newline newline after a moment , she calmed down . eyes somehow red , she turned from me , and looked in the mirror . running her hands through her hair , she shook , then returned to me . feebly , she raised her arm . a calender which had fallen on the floor amidst the ordeal rose up , and floated gently to me . it opened , and she pointed at the date . newline newline  5112014   newline newline mother s day . my mouth felt dry . my heart started to beat faster . i started to speak . newline newline  mom , i m so  newline newline she cut me off , shaking her head . she just stood looking at me , weeping . every attempt i made to apologize , she refuted speechlessly . so i just sat there , until i began to weep myself . newline newline  sorry , to anyone , if anyone reads this . it s incomplete , but i have to rush away , and wanted to get something up here .  newlineart is quite useless

s priceless newline newline newline newline newline newline newlineif it weren  t for the money , i  d have gone to the hospital long ago . newline newline it was just so much . checks that were enough to make me feel quite faint , appearing like clockwork in my mailbox every month . so i didn  t mind the fact that i blacked out every day for eight hours or so , and woke up feeling disorientated and slightly dizzy . if that was the price to pay , so be it . newline newline but i was curious . it couldn  t hurt to try and not pass out , just to see what happened . right ? newline newline so i did it . i sat on my bed and forced myself to keep my eyes open , fighting the urge that tried to drag me down to sleep . i was barely an hour into my attempt , when there came a knock at my front door . i opened it to find a woman staring at me . her eyes creeped me out : a grey so transparent they seemed almost silver . newline newline  i thought so . why aren  t you asleep ?  she demanded . newline newline  uhm ... what ? who are you ? why are you at my house ?  i asked . newline newline she gave a soft snort .  not this , again.  newline newline she reached up and softly touched my forehead . my house started to shimmer in the night air , eventually disappearing altogether . we were standing on cool sand dunes that stretched as far as the eye could see . stars that drifted and pulsed in wild , erratic patterns were scattered across the sky . newline newline  remember . don  t get confused by the humans  thoughts . you don  t own a house . that  s not your life ,  she said gently .  please , go back to work . your humans are already experiencing insomnia for what you  ve done . i don  t want to report you.  newline newline she scooped up a handful of sand and pressed it in my hand .  let them sleep . and remember what i  ve taught you ...  newline newline i suddenly remembered one of the mantras she d taught me when i started the job . it was coming back to me , the longer she was standing there , reminding me of who and what i was .  shape the dreams . don  t be consumed by them.  newline newline like the dream of receiving large checks in the mail . i squirmed with embarrassment at the thought . i really was still an amateur at this whole dream weaving thing . letting petty human desires eat away and control my memories . newline newline she smiled and squeezed my arm .  there you go . don  t worry , you  ll get better at this . all the new ones struggle at first . it s difficult not to be consumed by the dreams , at first . but please  try not to let it happen again.  newline newline she turned abruptly and shimmered out of view again , to return to her own realm . i sighed and sank back into the sands , and into the waiting minds of my humans . newline newline time to get back to work . newline newline   newline newline you can find more of my work on rinkfinger . what the hell do you think you re doing ? !  newline newline startled out of a deep sleep , i jolted up like a prairie dog popping out of its hole . fortunately for prairie dogs , however , they do nt sleep in bunk beds . newline newline  do you have any idea what time it is ? ?  i wince at both the throbbing in my forehead and the sharpness of the sergeant s inquiry . newline newline  i ... no , i do nt know what time   newline newline  did i ask for your opinion ? get out of bed and get yourself dressed , we leave in five !  sarge was being extra sargey today ... newline newline i tried to gather my senses as best i could while scrambling to get a shred of clothing on before the company moved out . it was the morning of the big day today ... the final push into german territory . we had finally gained our footing back , and for the past several months we have made everincreasing strides towards ending this godforsaken mess of a war . newline newline no time to think . these laces wo nt lace themselves ,  i thought with a sigh . newline newline an hour later , we were halfway to our destination , the supposed hq of ss operations , where intelligence had told us our dear friend would be . i was so ready to end this war that the ride felt like a year had gone by before the first marker . newline newline after dropping us off , our ride sped off again to regroup behind the front . we were alone . newline newline  hell of a day for a party , eh ?  newline newline  shut up marcus , you want to get shot ?  i did nt have time for his ridiculous quips . not now . newline newline  i do nt have any feelings on the matter , stan .  sigh newline newline crawling through mud at ten yards an hour was never bearable for me . no matter how many simulations they put you through , it s never truly like the real thing . newline newline after a long sludge , the hq building sat there in the distance in front of us . finally ... there it is ... my ticket out of this hell .  i pull up a picture of it and double check the coordinates . it was the place . but it was nt supposed to be this busy . newline newline  marcus , can you make out what they re doing over there ?  newline newline  it looks as if they are bringing hundreds of unmarked storage boxes into the compound . i do nt have xray vision , so i ca nt tell you what s inside them .  newline newline  yeah ? tell me something i do nt know .  newline newline  ... was that a serious request , or ?   newline newline  a joke , marcus .  newline newline  right , of course .  sigh ...  newline newline we decided to wait it out . it s not as if we could sneak in now , anyways , what with all the security . i get on the horn and deliver a few messages back to base camp , and see a few upsettingly nervous replies sent back . am i going to get out of this alive ? newline newline after what must have been thirty minutes , we see the last truck glide into the compound , and the doors close behind it . marcus and i make our move , slowly creeping toward the main building , ready to plant the device when we re close enough . newline newline  stan .  newline newline  shh ! !  newline newline  stan , it s an earthquake , we should quickly head away from   newline newline  the hell are you talking about , earthquake ? i do nt feel any   newline newline sure enough , the ground started furiously rumbling and violently shaking . i took cover under the nearest tree . sure , that s what still works with our equipment , earthquake detection . not freaking longrange scans or working shoelaces or xray   newline newline suddenly , the roof exploded . not and explosion from a bomb , where the rubble shoots out in all directions . more like something crashed upwards through the ceiling , since the debris shot primarily upwards into the sky . newline newline  large impact , 10:00 at 100 yards in twenty seconds , stan .  newline newline  when do you shut up with your calculations ? ?  newline newline there was no time for a response , of course . we ran a safe distance away from stan s impact zone and quickly turned back to see what was emerging from the building . newline newline  is that   newline newline  it s most likely what was in those storage containers .  newline newline  obviously . but i mean , who s piloting it ?  newline newline  ... oh . oh that s no good . that s no good at all ,  marcus buzzed . newline newline  your billions of calculations a second have struck gold again , marcus .  i knew marcus did nt have any humanlike physiological reactions , but it would nt have hurt to have seen him tremble for once in his stupid robotic life . newline newline why did nt we see this coming ? who screwed up on satellite duty ? why is our damn military so damn inept ? ? well , one thing was for sure , anyways . newline newline hitler had been busy .his wife s scream scared him shitless . newline newline  what is it cynthia ?  he asked , startled . newline newline all she could do is silently point at what their seven year old son wrote . newline newline murder newline newline  newline newline a is for alleged , you do nt know if i did it . newline newline b is for burn , which happened to the corpses . newline newline c is for ca nt . because you ca nt save them . newline newline d is for dead . they already are . newline newline e is for electric chair . that is how one died . newline newline f is for fun . which i had when it happened . newline newline g is for gone . which also happened to the corpses . newline newline h is for hell . that is where the murderer goes . newline newline i is for internal bleeding . that s how another died . newline newline j is for joking . i made this all up . newline newline k is for kidding . i made all of this up . newline newline l is for love you . i love you guys . newline newline m is for mommy , who i love the most . newline newline n is for nothing . newline newline o is for on the bed , which is where the body is . newline newline p is for pretend nothing happened . newline newline q is for quiet . you ll understand why . newline newline r is for run . they re onto me . newline newline s is for save them . which you can not . newline newline t is for time to go . the police are here . newline newline u is for untouched . which is how we must leave the bodies . newline newline v is for very unlucky . which is how you must feel . newline newline w is for what are you waiting for , they re coming . newline newline x marks the spot where we can escape on this map . newline newline y is for you d better come with me . newline newline z is for zebra . they re so cute . with their little mixture of black and white stripes . it s adorable . i want a zebra . but is nt she the queen ?  , i asked innocently . newline newline my mother sighed deeply . the noise in the street quieted as the queen passed by and continued her way through the city . newline  my dear child , a queen she may be but it is nt a title she earned  , she said in a somber tone . newline newline that was the end of the conversation that day . we hurried home for dinner and it was nt for a few weeks until i remembered what mother had said about the queen killing our gods . as far as i could remember i only knew one god , the god . my parents had mournfully worshiped other gods in the privacy of our home , but would never tell me about them . newline newline  it does nt matter little one , they are no longer with us , now run along !  , would be their response . newline newline i gained up the courage to ask my mother while she was preparing some food for lunch one day . newline newline  so how did the queen do it ? how did she kill the gods ?  newline newline my mother gave a sigh , and put down the food as she gestured for me to sit in her lap . newline newline  my dear child , it all starts one day when the king wished to find a wife . so he set out to find the most beautiful wife within our own city  newline newline  but do nt kings usually marry princesses ?  , i asked . newline newline she laughed . newline newline  yes usually my dear child , but we were at peace , one that seemed likely to last for many years to come . the gods had blessed us so ... . he had no need to marry a princess he hardly knew . he had the freedom and chance to find love ... ..and indeed he has been fooled into thinking he found it ... the queen is a young woman of great beauty , but inside she is as ugly as a corpse . she fooled the king with her looks , persuaded his heart with her flesh . the wise royal advisor saw through and tried to help the king but he would nt listen . the queen and her family came from a place far away , and her craftiness is beyond that of this land ... .then the queen made it so her own relatives were elevated into positions in the palace , one even got a parade for his heroism  . she began to fill the kings head with her foreign ideas . again the advisor tried to stop this , and almost persuaded the king to get the entire lot of the queens family eradicated from the land , but again she was able to twist the narrative and had the advisor killed . with no voice of reason the king began to take his wife s words to heart . he turned his back on the true gods , accepting her false one and making him reign supreme . our temples were repurposed , our idols were smashed , and our gods were dead . all because of that vile woman ...  newline newline i look up at my mothers face , noticing that tears had been streaming down it for some time now . i hug her and cry myself . newline newline the next day at the temple i say a prayer , for the first time it is not to the god , but to the gods . newline what are you talking about ? people do nt like you , death .  santa clause looked at his hooded friend consolingly . newline newline  oh come off it . of course people like me !  death s face was not visible , but his raspy voice echoed from beneath the folds of his cloak . newline newline the easter bunny just laughed .  what are you talking about ? you take people away from their loved ones ! everyone hates ya , dude .  he leaned back in the bar booth , put a carrot in between his teeth , and lit it like a cigar . newline newline death waved the orange colored smoke away with his hand .  but that s only because people do nt know what s on the other side ! if they knew that after they died , they got  newline newline  look death ,  santa interrupted ,  you ca nt fault people for disliking you . it s human nature . they only like you if you give them gifts they understand , like presents under a tree .  newline newline  or eggs in a basket !  peter interjected , without removing the smoking carrot from his mouth . newline newline death felt cornered . people disliking him was nt fair , they simply did nt see the whole picture .  i bet i could get people to like me !  his raspy voice cracked . newline newline the easter bunny exhaled more orange smoke .  not in a million years !  he laughed . newline newline  tell you what , death . if you can get people to like you in one week , i ll put in a good word for you with the festivity committee . see if we can get you your own holiday .  santa smiled warmly . newline newline  you mean a worldwide holiday ? not just in mexico ?  death was on the edge of his seat . newline newline  no sir , a real holiday . celebrated by the majority of the humans .  newline newline  you re on !  death snapped his fingers , and immediately dissipated from the bar . newline newline santa clause turned to the rabbit , who was trying to conceal an ace of spades in his fur , and grabbed him by his red bow tie .  peter ! we ca nt let the humans like him ! that man cannot have his own holiday !  his eyes were full of fear and anxiety . newline newline  then why d you offer it ! ?  the bunny said , straightening himself out from the old man s roughhousing . newline newline  i just wanted to shut him up and get him out of here ! you know how he gets when he s had too many drinks ! he could cause another plane crash !  newline newline  oh all right ! but you owe me one fat boy !  the easter bunny put out his carrot on the table , and puffed himself away . newline newline he spent the next few hours tracking death down , and eventually found him heading into a family s home , very late at night . death was here because the father was scheduled to die of a heart failure . the hooded figure was going to prevent the man s death , and gain a few brownie points with the humans . newline newline the easter bunny had other plans however . he snuck into the house as quick as a hare , and placed a child s toy right in front of death s path , causing him to trip . the fall sent harsh vibrations and loud noise through the house , waking everyone from their sleep . newline newline  what was that ? !  the wife sharply whispered , clutching her husband s shoulder tightly . newline newline  i do nt know , i ll go check it out ,  he grunted . the father grabbed his sidearm from his nightstand drawer , and made his way out into the dark hallway . newline newline death was picking himself up off the floor , muttering to himself .  ohhhh if i had nt already met my children quota for the month , this one would surely get it !  newline newline meanwhile , the cunning easter bunny was silently placing a raw egg at the top of the stairs . once it was perfectly positioned , he retreated into the shadows , and waited . newline newline the human took slow steps , each one closer to his death . he was doing more listening than looking , given how dark it was this time of night . because of this , he failed to notice the small egg placed precariously above the first step . he shifted his weight one last time , and slipped . newline newline all the man s weight brought him crashing down towards his foyer . death looked at the crumpled body lying at his feet .  damn ,  he said softly . newline newline the rabbit was already out of the house , poised to follow death to his next destination , thinking of clever ways in which he could incorporate a woven basket into someone s demise .and that s why you re in prison ? newline newline yeah ... at least this way the only people i m stealing luck from deserve it . newline newline and what about me ? is nt this call leeching my luck away ? newline newline no , it seems to only work in proximity to me ... like an invisible field of luck absorption newline newline let me get this straight , you absorb the luck of people around you newline newline yes newline newline and you succeed in everything you try newline newline riiiiight ... newline newline well , have you ever tried just duplicating their luck without robbing them of it ? newline newline i ... damn ... that would have been a lot easier ... newline newline than ? newline newline getting arrested . do you know how hard it is to be arrested by the most unlucky cops ever ?harold wrapped the cloak of blackness around him like a familiar coat . he could feel the rope tighten like a firm hand around his throat . he had not lived a good or happy life . newline newline newline his mother margaret had just been the product of a sad cycle , he couldn  t blame her without also blaming himself . she hadn  t chosen to be the victim of child abuse or the domino effect it would have on the rest of her life . maybe she could have overcome it , been stronger and not passed that abuse down another generation , but maybe she couldn  t have . newline newline newline harold knew what he was , always would be . he could feel his mother  s weakness inside him . he had never considered himself very brave , very strong or very smart . in his optimistic moments he thought it was just the abuse talking , but harold had always been more of a pessimist . newline newline newline he knew he was just like her , he was so full of hate and anger , with a temper that was as violent as it was unpredictable . there was only one real way to break the cycle . newline newline newline newline school had been a place of misery , he couldn  t help but get into fights . he did nt fit in , and was always on the outside , his rage would leak out on the few unfortunate children who had taken the bullying too far . suspension and expulsion , had become a revolving door of punishment , but had done nothing to help harold . each one only leading to a new and more brutal beating at home . newline newline newline the blows would come from the darkness , her foot steps silent on the thick carpet , the pain always coming from a new direction . she had been blind long enough to know exactly how to make sight an undefeatable advantage . so all he could do was wait for it to end , and then clean up the mess . newline newline newline it didn  t get easier as he got older , as others his age started to see . newline newline newline his highschool had advanced sight courses , you  d learned how important it was to see at an early age . they  d quote statistics that strongly correlated  age at sight development  with all sorts of positive life developments , they didn  t mention the statistics for the late bloomers , but the worst was always implied . newline newline newline and of course the first thing you  d hear from a kid once they could see was the long list of things blind people had never done . there had never been a blind , president or senator . none of the famous sport stars were blind , and none of truly famous and loved actors had ever been blind . there had of course been a few successful scientist that has made it through the various blind purges in history , and others that had made their mark , but there had always been an unspoken ugliness that followed these people , a scar on their legacy unfaded by the generations . newline newline newline as more kids transitioned into the world of the sighted , harold could feel himself gradually transitioning from the majority into the minority . life would never get to be easy for him . newline newline newline in highschool he was at least one of many , in college he was one of few . as an adult being blind was something to stay away from , a sign of human malfunction . nobody ever asked if it had been a choice , a fear that kept him blind , everyone just assumed it wasn  t . newline newline looking back now , the feeling disappearing from his limbs as the blood makes one final push to protect his vital organs , a gentle coldness creeping in from the darkness , he ca nt help but feel a sharp twist of regret as he remembered the one girl who he had given sight to . newline newlinei slowly awake and look around blankly . something constantly beeps on the near side of the room , as a man in a white coat walks in . newline newline doctor :  it s amazing that your alive . you ve been frozen for the better half of a century .  newline newline me :  what are you talking about ?  newline newline doctor :  its belived that you were on the titanic , and in some miraculous way , you froze while in the water . though we re still trying to figure out how .  newline newline me :  ... am i going to be okay ?  newline newline doctor :  well i d like to say yes , but there is one complication .  newline newline me :  complication ?  newline newline doctor :  i regret to inform you , but the shrinkage is permanent ...  newline newline me :  doc , let me die ...  newline newline fin newlineafter years and years of researching , investigating , and fundraising , i had finally returned to the honduran mosquita jungle . ever since i graduated and began working as an archaeologist , i have dreamed of searching these jungles . the last time i was in the region , i was just an intern , stuck at the university studying artifacts that others had found beneath the rain forest  s thick canopy . i had never been allowed out in the field , but ever since i first laid eyes on that white weathered stone serpent that the field team had recovered , finding the legendary white city had been my obsession . now , my ten years of dedication was about to pay off . by documenting the locations where artifacts had been found , i had narrowed down the jungle to a searchably small area that i believed may be the location of the lost city . my guide eyed the dark clouds that had formed overhead nervously . the forecast for the day had been clear , but in this part of the world you never know . if it got bad we could always return tot he campsite . i had flown over the area last week in a lowflying plane , and had seen a whitish cliff north of where our campsite was pitched . if i could just reach that point before the storm broke newline newline newline we pushed through a particularly stubborn bit of vegetation , and nearly walked face first into the white stone . what had looked like a small cliff from the air was actually a huge stone gate , green moss obscuring much of the white stone from view . the gate looked like it opened into the hillside . any ornaments that had once decorated the stone slab had long since eroded away , except for a carving of a lunging viper on either side of the door . there was a slight crack in between the two sides of the gate . i leaned my shoulder against it and pushed as gently as you can push suck a large rock . it moved , just slightly .  give me a hand , will you ?  i asked as i turned back around to my guide . he stood as far back as he could from the gate , his frightened face barely visible among the jungle ferns .  what are you doing all the way back there ? it won  t bite.  the guide shook his head , and pointed at the carved serpents on the door .  la maldita serpiente !  he said with a quivering voice . that was one of the big problems with hiring natives as guides . the better they are at navigating the rainforest , the more superstitious they become . i turned back to the door with a huff and renewed resolve . i worked the door back and forth slowly until the crack in between the doors was big enough for me to grab the edge with my hands , and pulled the door open . even in the overcast light , you could see the white stone continue into a tunnel in the hill . newline newline newline i had done it ! the white city was real ! no one would ever laugh at my research again ! i stepped into the tunnel . i should report back and return with some backup . i took a few more steps down the hall . the guide yelled something from outside . something about snakes ? whatever . it didn  t matter . i was finally , finally here ! the air grew darker and cooler as i walked down the hall . i  ll need to get my flashlight out soon . i think i left it with my pack outside . not yet . just a little farther newline newline newline i stepped on a smooth , rounded object that slipped out from under my foot , and landed in a cursing heap on the ground . damn it ! ! ! what  s getting in my way now ! ? the object had light up when it bounced against the wall . it couldn  t be my heart sank as i reached for the old brick cell phone i had tripped on . someone must have been here before me . but why hadn  t they reported their findings ? i  ve dedicated the past ten years of my life to finding the white city , and this is the closest i  ve ever been . the phone itself was old , but it still had power . whoever it was must not have been here very long ago . maybe it i can find out whose phone it is , they can tell me what they found . i scrolled though the contact list , and recognized the names . maybe it belonged to someone back at the camp ? but there is more than just researchers on here . there is aunt julie . and my favorite pizza place from back at the university . i turned the phone in my hand . there was a scratch on the back from that time i crashed my bike . no doubt about it . this was the phone i had lost back when i was an intern . but what was it doing here ? had someone stolen it ? a red exclamation mark in the corner of the screen showed that the phone had one missed message . i typed the answering machine code into the dial pad , and brought the phone up to my ear .  you have one missed message from 12817 at 5:00 pm . press one to play the message.  i pressed one . newline newline newline  why ... back ... so long ...  newline newline newline the blood drained from my face . it was muffled and hard to hear , but the voice on the recording was definitely my own . i heard a rumble from the tunnels entrance , and whipped around to see the doors start to close . newline newline newline  waiting so long.  newline newline newline the recording continued as i ran back up the tunnel . the door slammed shut just before i reached it . i dropped the phone and shoved the door , but this time it wouldn  t budge at all .  miguel ! help ! ! !  could he hear me through the stone ? had he run away before it closed ? newline newline newline  if you would like to repeat this message , please press 2  newline newline newline i picked up the phone again . it looked like it wasn  t getting a signal down here . there had been a little more to the message that i hadn  t heard . i pressed 2 , and began to walk back down the hall . if there was a way out , it had to be this way . newline newline newline  finally returned ...  newline newline newline as i walked , i noticed carvings on the wall from the dim glow of the phone screen . these had been preserved better than those on the outside door . one in particular caught my eye . the white stone head of a serpent , jaws open and delicately carved fangs exposed . the mirror image of the one i studied as an intern . newline newline newline  never leave again stay.  newline newline newline at the last word the stone serpent lunged at my neck as fast as a flesh and blood snake . i shrieked wildly and tried to jerk back , but the stone creature  s grip couldn  t be broken . as my vision began to go dark , i heard the last few words from the dropped phone . newline newline newline  lonely stay stay stay gia was an artist . she preferred sketches to paintings , graphite to oil paint , etc . newline she enjoyed drawing landscapes . beaches were among her favorites . newline the white sand contrasted by the black ocean mesmerized her . newline she often sported shades as they dulled out the atmosphere more . newline newline gia rested by the shore , ready to create another sketch , when a young man approached her . newline newline  may i sit here ?  he shyly questioned newline newline she nodded with a polite smile . newline newline the boy talked about how he noticed she would come to the beach just to draw . his name was fin . he admitted that he admired her talent . this made her ecstatic . nobody appreciated her art this much . after the hours of sketching and chatting with her new friend , the sun began to sink . they bid each other goodbye . newline newline she went back the next day . to her surprise , the boy was there already . he had a canvas and had painted the sunset . though , it remained gray to her , he could could see the faded blue and pale orange of the sky . the time was spent on their crafts with a usual conversation about filial things like carrots . newline newline  what makes carrots so special ?  gia pondered newline newline  they were nt always orange ,  fin replied in modest ,  they used to be purple or white .  newline newline  colors changing ... that s funny . i would nt live to see the day when they do .  newline newline  yeah , probably  newline newline they kept this schedule up for a while . gia would come out to draw , fin would keep her company  it was nice . after a few months or so of this , fin convinced her to try painting . she could nt differentiate the colors well but he helped her . newline it was her last stroke when she quickly raised the brush above her head and lightly swiped it across his face . newline she broke out in hysteria while he remained puzzled . newline newline  ssomething about gettin  someone else messy is hilarious ,  gia managed through the laughter . newline newline oh  newline newline he grabbed a handful of pink and swabbed it all over her . newline she sent him a death stare . they had a paint war until they both collapsed heaving for breath . newline newline  your shades are dirty ,  fin remarked ,  let me get them clean for you .  newline newline he reached over to get her shades . she shut her eyes as they came off . the sky she stared up at was suddenly blue . she looked over to fin to see his tan skin , jetblack hair , and brown eyes . he sent her warm smile as he laid on the beige sand being outlined by the transparent aqua blue water . newline newline  what you see is how you feel ,  fin gently laced his fingers through hers ,  just to let you know , that sunset a while back was the first time i saw color .  newline newline   what the fuck was that ?  he seemingly randomly exclaimed , sitting up on the couch . newline newline  hm ?  she was deep in the recesses her phone , scrolling through countless recipes and pictures of food that had no chance of ever being made . newline newline  you did nt see that ?  . stupid question . see above . newline newline  no  . newline newline  did you hear that ?  newline newline  no .  newline newline  fucking ... .computer mouse just popped up and moved across my field of fashion and ... .cant believe you did nt see that . it fucking made a click and everything . are you serious ? you really did nt notice .  newline newline  nope .  newline newline oh my god , this is the greatest day of my life , michael thought . this is the day all his problems went away . he could finally come home and relax . no more constant harass . no more interruptions . no more arguments about whose turn it was . finally free to spend time doing what he wanted and talking about what he wanted . it had nt been like that in over a year . then he thought , holy shit . they would actually be able to have a normal romantic life again . no more interruptions . this truly is epic , he thought . newline newline  what happened ? she asked , her interest peaked by his silence . newline newline  naw , nothing , i do nt know , fucking , mind playing tricks on me . i m tired . been a long week .  newline newline  yeah , me too , i could just curl up with my book and go to sleep .  newline newline  yeah ... or ... ... ..  he said , sliding his hand down her arm and under her shirt , with an over exaggerated wink . newline newline she rolled her eyes ,  you know we ca nt in here , we always get interrupted .  newline newline  i m almost positive we wo nt this time ... .  he said , putting on his most serious and devilish face . newline newline the next morning he woke up and went to get a drink from the fridge . ah , what a great fucking night , he said aloud . newline newline  good morning  , she wrapped her arms around him .  last night was great , ca nt believe we went so long  . newline newline  told ya .  newline newline  did you feed kitty ?  newline newline he paused ... ..looked up and stared straight ahead . newline newline  yes . i fed the cat .  newline newline  okay good , where is he ? my little kitty is so cute ! i need to hold him !  newline newline  i saw him a minute ago ... ..uhh ... hes around . you know how he is .  newline newline he could probably keep this facade up for a day , two at the most , maybe whatever the hell happen would clear itself up or become more apparent . but then he decided he did nt care . fuck that cat , little bastard , he thought . newline newline just then he turned around and there it was . the mouse clicker hung deftly in the air , hovering above the kitchen table . he froze . she was at the sink , washing her hands , sunlight glistening off her long auburn hair . newline newline the cursor began to move . newline newline  wait..fucking ... just wait a minute ! what the fuck , wait !  newline newline  what ?  she said , startled , turning around . newline newline the mouse moved over her and hovered on her chest . newline newline he closed his eyes .  fuck .  then heard a click .i sat in the hardbacked wooden chair in the nursery . i should have been in the living room watching television or something . but the baby would not go to sleep . it just sat staring at me with wide , impassive , dark eyes . newline newline there was something disturbing about the baby . about the whole house , actually . it was all distantly familiar , like something encountered in a dream or a fading memory . newline newline it was a nice place . just a little outdated . the television in the living room as an old crt , the top covered in dust . the microwave was a big bulky model . the tupperware in the cabinet was burnt orange and avocado green . i had heart for the kid  my parents had been just the same . always a few years behind the times . newline newline and perhaps that was the problem . the familiarity and unfamiliarity of it all , working at the same time . it reminded me too much of growing up . we moved when i was oneandahalf . i barely remembered my first home . then again when i was five . and again when i was ten . newline newline dad was some sort of government scientist , and his work had us moving to government labs all over the country . different versions of the same house . different versions of the same people . different versions of the same us . it seemed like it had gone on like that forever . like we had been dislodged from time . resetting every few years . popping up somewhere else . somewhen else . newline newline the baby was still staring at me , its dark eyes a reflection of my own . and then its gaze shifted , looking just behind me . newline newline i turned , and saw , unmistakably , an older version of myself standing in the doorway . he gazed at me in mute irritation , his wide , dark eyes a mirror of my own . i sat , my breath caught in my chest , unable to speak or scream , staring wordlessly , trying to piece together my fragmenting reality . newline newline i was just about to say something , when my gaze shifted to a form standing behind him . newline newline he turned to look ... .i m not staring because i do nt have eyes . but if i still had eyes i would be staring , blank faced at what i d found . an out of the way registry entry . 9 years ago i d cataloged all my thoughts , all my memories , every cycle so i could revisit them at my leisure , copy them , modify them and keep the original . i d made what i called the registry , which was in fact exactly like a normal registry but with some modifications for nonsequential searches and implied network connections . newline newline 10 years ago i d died . my body had died and the copy of myself , me had continued on inside the custom built computer . for a while i d thought that i would need to construct a modeling environment to house the quantum state of my brain , but moore s law was not quite fast enough to allow for anything like that . so , instead i d created an interface that i was able to wear that recorded the impulse patterns , not the phenomena but the epiphenenomena . when my body had died and all phenomena had ceased a coalition program popped up and i woke up inside the computer . to this day i m not actually sure how i did it . or if i did it at all . but i did nt worry myself about those questions for a long time until they stared at me or i stared at them , eyeless . newline newline the registry entry was a memory of myself or not myself but me anyway on a trip with my wife . it was nt an important trip but we d been somewhere that that had stayed with me and so their was an entry so that i could easily go back and check that memory space , relive or mold it into something else . i do nt think i d ever gotten around to putting the velociraptor fight in that particular memory but i had enough memories of my dinosaur fighting days so it really was nt a loss . the problem was nt the entry . the problem was that the memory segment was bad . so i could nt recall the memory . i assumed i d used some raid system but did nt know the actual physical make up of the computer . i , my progenitor had , but not me . so the memory was gone . normally if you forget something you do nt know you forgot it , its just gone , but this was a constant sign post pointing at the abyss saying that there was nothing there that should be . i could nt do much but try and execute that particular entry over and over again . i stayed at it for days not merely because because of the horror at this development but now that i knew it was possible i was afraid to see how much i had lost . how much of my entries were not just post it notes set to remind me of lost things . curse those who survived .  said the captain beneath his breath . his skin was a rotted green . a cackle came from the near skeletal helmsman . the bridge of the titanic smelled of the sea , and the dead . newline newline the captain came to the window that overlooked the deck  the moving corpses of the lost had gathered to witness their return . newline newline numerous other ships were moving ahead of the titanic to intercept them , but they were tiny by comparison . a voice boomed from one of the small ships with flashing lights . newline newline  turn around ! this is new york coast guard ! turn around ! you are on a collision course !  newline newline the captain turned to the helmsman .  full speed ahead .  he said . newline newline the helmsman begins to cackle again just before collision . steel begins to crumple and screech as the bow of the titanic rams through another ship bound into harbor . the titanic ripped through the other ship , confirming a destiny to sink like the titanic once had . newline newline running aground the titanic began to bring a ghastly sea with it . crashing into the buildings , the screams and sound of havoc reminded the captain of the night he had died ... newline newline washing over the streets of new york in a swath of destruction , the titanic has returned . newline hey , remember me ?  newline newline i twisted around in my seat . was someone speaking ? i lifted one side of my headphones .  hello ?  i was pretty sure i had the house to myself , even with the headphones , i could usually tell when my housemates came home . nothing . newline newline i went back to the music and my latest project , dismissing the incident . newline newline    newline newline i was half zonedout , folding laundry in front of the tv , when i heard that voice again .  after all these years , is this really how you  re going to be ?  i looked up sharply , but the voice was from the side , not from the speakers . the credits were rolling anyway , it couldn  t have been my show . newline newline i added another tshirt to the pile . hearing things , not good . i had an appointment next week , but maybe i could talk to my doctor on the phone . i felt fairly certain that this was stress , and tried a few relaxing techniques . newline newline  really ? you  re just going to shutter me off and forget about me again , aren  t you ? dang it cindy , i thought i meant something to you !  newline newline i dumped the unmatched socks off my lap when i stood .  okay , if you  ve got a speaker in here , you  ve probably got a microphone . cut it out !  i twisted around , trying to figure out where the speaker was hidden . to be that loud , it couldn  t be too small , right ?  or  keep talking so i can find it !  newline newline i turned the living room upsidedown and found no sign of the speakers , or a microphone . the voice didn  t come back . newline newline i stopped staying at the house by myself , finding excuses to stay at the library or spending hours with a cup of coffee and a book at the caf . my therapist couldn  t determine a cause and we discussed medication options . but before that , we went back to the notion that this was some sort of pranki got my boyfriend to help me search for any possible bugs or microphones . he offered to move in with me , but there really wasn  t space for another adult in that house . newline newline    newline newline  okay , so it seems pretty clear that i  m going about this all wrong.  the voice came at night , while i was halfasleep . i jolted upright , pushing aside my blankets .  cindy , it  s me , bunny . please , don  t you remember me ?  newline newline  bunny ?  i peered into the darkness . why was that name familiar ? newline newline  yes . we were best friends , and then when you learned other people couldn  t see me  well , you said i was imaginary , and i believed it . i believed it and i went away . your parents forgot about me . but i  m not imaginary . i  m real ! so i  m back . i wanted to see if you remembered me.  newline newline back from where ? i clutched my blankets and tried to settle my breathing . newline newline  back from all sorts of places . we used to talk about wanting to see the world . i did . it  s not like people can stop me from getting on planes , nobody else could see me.  i felt a weight settle at the foot of my bed , i could see a shadowy figure as i remembered my best friend , as i remembered the adventures bunny and i used to have . newline newline  but it  s boring , being by myself ,  she continued .  i saw neat things , but couldn  t talk about them with anyone . i can follow people , but i can  t touch anything , i can  t do anything . and i missed my friend . i missed being a friend . so i came back , because i want that again . i want you to believe in me . i believe in you , cindy.  newline newline  bunny   i could picture her face in my memory . the little girl , so much like me , but better . she sounded older now , and the image in my head gradually morphed into a bunny around my own age . newline newline  there you go . you do remember . i  ve been watching you , but not as much as i  d like . how have you been ? what are you doing with yourself lately ? maybe  maybe we can be friends again ?  newlinei opened my door , hearing the postman ring the doorbell and walk away . he had left a largish package on my doorstep , which was surprisingly light . i took it inside , shut the door , and opened the package . inside was one of the oddest things . it was a textbook , like i had ordered , but at the same time it wasn  t . i lifted it and , examining the  textbook  , i realized it was a type of tablet . it lit up at the touch of my fingertips , and glowed with the message hello . welcome to history , 2025 edition .  newline newline  what the hell ?  i wondered . at the bottom of the screen sat a large flashing button . click me

the square ? what  s the square ? texas succeeded ? when was this ? did i miss it ? or has it even happened yet ?  i was starting to worry about this textbook . how much did it know ? what year did it

during this time period , american culture has taken a deep dive for the worse , culture everyday coming up with new terms like  wumh   what  s up my homie  ,  euac   eating up a cheeseburger  and

starting to get too weird .  selfie had just come out how was it in this book too ? is this book actually from the future ?  i wondered to myself . it was time to close the book . throw it away , burn it in a fire , it doesn  t really matter what i did , i just had to get rid of it . but first , i had to know : do i become famous ? there was a little bar in the top right corner of the book . i took this to be the search bar , and sure enough , clicking on it made a physical keyboard pop out of the side of the book . i typed in my name , jacob hensley , and hit go . it came up with the message : it seems you are trying to search up someone from the past . if so , please clarify their dob and address below . i filled it in , and right there , shining on my screen , was my name . my address . my parent  s names . my birthday . and one more number , which i had a sneaking suspicion that i knew what it was . hesitating for only a moment , i clicked on my name . it brought me to a page all about me , stating my hobbies , my grades , my profession , and at the very bottom of the page , my death date . march 28 , 2014 . 13:34:27 . jacob hensley committed suicide by hanging , leaving the note : watch out , miley c. newline newline it s not my best work , but i enjoyed writing it . feel free to leave criticismcomplaints . this is your last chance ,  morpheus said , his hands outstretched , several small pills lying in each upturned palm .  after this , there is no turning back . you take the blue pill  the story ends , you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe . you take the red pill  you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbithole goes.  newline newline  i see ,  neo said , staring at the pills in morpheus  hands .  and what about the orange one ?  newline newline  the orange what ?  morpheus said , glancing up at neo . newline newline  the orange pill , in your left hand.  newline newline morpheus glanced down at his palm and stared at it for a moment , his shoulders drooping . he leaned back slightly and sighed heavily . newline newline  dammit ,  he whispered ,  i grabbed too many.  he looked back up at neo .  you  re not supposed to know about the other ones . can we just focus on the red and the blue ?  newline newline  wait ,  neo said ,  why can  t i know what the orange does ?  it looked like it was probably chockfull of vitamin c , which would certainly be a pretty solid choice . better than waking up in a bed and not being sure of what was real , at least . newline newline  it  s just ,  morpheus paused .  look , can we forget about the orange ? do you want to see how deep the rabbithole goes , or do you want to be a quitter ?  newline newline  i want to know what the orange pill does ,  neo said , staring at the oblong medicine . if it was a vitamin c pill , he  d absolutely take it over the others . at least then he could walk away with some nutrients in his system , rather than either a lifetime of regret or confusion . then again , he could also just combine it with one of the others . if he was going to wake up in either some rabbit hole or his bed , it wouldn  t hurt to have a few extra vitamins in his body . newline newline  fine ,  morpheus sighed . he shook his palm slightly , the pills shifting forward .  the orange one lets you change genders . it  s a hormone therapy thing.  newline newline  really ?  neo said , staring at the pill .  if i take it , i get to become a female ?  he  d always secretly felt like he were a woman trapped within a man  s body , but forced those thoughts deep down inside himself and ignored them whenever they resurfaced . it was easier to pretend they didn  t exist . still , he always knew the truth , always knew what burned within . the orange pill certainly seemed a pretty good option , especially considering his two otherwise lackluster ones . newline newline  no ,  morpheus said ,  it  s a slow process . this is just one of the hundreds of pills i takei mean you  ll have to take.  he paused .  but , you know , it  s worth it . and it  s nothing to be ashamed of . when you  re just not happy with who you are , sometimes it  s best to change yourself.  newline newline  right ,  neo said , turning his attention to morpheus  left hand .  what about that green pill ?  newline newline  what ?  morpheus said , following neo  s gaze toward his left hand .  oh , fuck me . god dammit . please ignore that pill , will you ?  newline newline  okay ,  neo said .  so i have a choice of the red , blue , and orange ?  newline newline  yeswait , no . the orange is out of the picture . you only have the red and blue.  newline newline  what ? why ? how come i can  t choose to become a woman ?  neo stared at morpheus , his head tilted in disbelief . he  d made up his mind a moment prior , decided it would absolutely be the orange one . he  d even begun imagining himself walking through the park on a warm spring day , his dress softly scraping the floor , a tightfitting bra strapped to his chest . he felt happyfor the first time , he felt happy . newline newline  it  s just not for you ,  morpheus said , sighing .  please , just focus on the red and the blue.  newline newline  i changed my mind ,  neo said , crossing his arms over his chest ,  i want to know what the green one does.  newline newline  you just told me you would forget you saw it ,  morpheus said , his voice rising slightly as he threw his hands up in the air . neo wasn  t sure if morpheus had a history of hitting people he tried to help , but he didn  t exactly feel like he would walk away without at least one punch to the face . still , if morpheus was going to be difficult , so was he . newline newline  yeah , well , i see it now . if you  re going to take away my gender pill , then i  m asking about the green . tell me what it does.  newline newline  you know what ? fine . the green one will literally turn you into an orca whale . it isn  t supposed to be for you , it  s for our initiative to protect the seas from the agents.  newline newline  i  m sorry ?  neo said , suddenly incredibly interested in the green pill . while he did feel like a woman trapped in a man  s body , he  d always had the undying thought that he was actually an orca whale trapped in a woman  s body that was trapped in a man  s body .

from the world . newline newline should the intended family receive the letter , philip knew the damage it would do . when the americans reached the japanese mainland , there would be no telling how

newlineargus rapidly cycled between news networks on the large screen of the communal hall . a crowd had gathered around him under the clean , white , canvas tent . beads of sweat lingered on his temple as a cold shiver ran down his body . he fidgeted in his fatigue pants . the barracks of young men and women in grey was hushed as they watched the anxious newscasters of earth report the homeworld  s colossal failure . on mars , minarets of dust twisted upwards in the wind , and the breeze of artificial oxygen was heaven . it seemed impossible to imagine the homeworld  s end on such a fine evening . colonial authority had only just recently made argus rico a squad leader with his junior cadet company . yet he now had no idea what to tell the others . he was normally the bossman and the know it all , do it all . now he was another teenager . a cadet in the back , karlson , skinny and freckled , spoke up  how long does it take for an ecm signal to get here ?   anywhere between 5 minutes to 20  cadet li said , a crack in her voice  for all we know , the planet could be dead as is   shut your mouth  ara spat back , and suddenly everyone remembered she had brothers still on earth . the others felt lucky their immediates were on site , some by more than a generation . the noise of the broadcaster was paid no due attention . the cadets were focused on the footage . from a terran perspective , they viewed the failed detonation . the blackened patch of sky looked like nothing , only a cluster of nightsky untouched by stars . the object was blocking a portion of sky . that is until a brilliant fire came and went from view . the telltale double flash of nuclear hell revealed itself like a silent lightning , and as quick as it arrived , it was gone . they knew it wouldn  t come , yet they watched the footage , awaiting a breakup of the object . they waited for stars to slowly ignite like tiny candles to fill that void of the sky . they waited in vain . tears streaked down faces , and another cadet began to heave into a bin . the forty  s faces turned a hue of bright red from the alarm . they were startled as the siren blared and the screen flashed  emergency slipspace maneuver  . how fitting it announced air raids centuries ago . the cadets rushed outside as did others in their canvas modules . the gargantuan plasma dome above them , covering the entirety of olympus  peak , opened a hole in spacetime , allowing a badly damaged fleet to appear out of the grey sky , trailing smoke and fire . they watched in horror as the cargo group landed desperately , outpouring civilians in droves . they covered themselves in blankets , surgical masks , and what was left of their possessions . the refugees of old had returned to humanity  s history . the flagship  s copilot rushed out with fire crews , who made embers dormant and wounds painless . the pilot sprinted from the runway to speak with the commander , and cadets sprang to meet them . captain liam farland of the colonial merchants was white faced , aside from red eyes . he yelled to commander aronovich , agony in his voice .  we made ftl as soon as we could ! the blind jump nearly slammed us into the fucking surface !  sergeant argus rico ran up , cadets in toe .  it  s happening ? !  the captain screamed in manic terror  it has happened ! i saw it all from orbit before we nearly ripped the deck in two ! we  re all that  s left ! see the light for yourself , it had to have caught up !  commander aronovich called to the a.i .  penni ! bring up terra on the plasma shield ! magnify !  the translucent dome generated a screen off its surface , extracting the image of a gorgeous blue planet from a grey evening sky . the homeworld was slowly , violently ripped apart by an object scarred black . the planet was being glassed as its surface boiled and turned dark like obsidian . the volcanic shards hurdled through space ever so slowly , yet at hundreds of miles every second . they streamed fire like wounds in the sky , brilliantly illuminating the void as they left the cataclysmic event . even off screen , they could see the onceblue planet become a red light , a beacon of death . it glowed a blinding red , like another star as it collapsed into its own hellfire . cadets dropped to their knees , others desperately reaching out to the dying world . none knew what was next , all knew what it had made them : they had become an endangered species . the last bastion of humanity .a simple pin was all it took . and a not quite as simple enchantment , that rips

alike . newline newline the blacksmiths showed even the dullest of squires how to properly maintain a sword perfectly with one little prick . newline newline the princesses ... well . you get the idea . newline newline i was simply a trader , i went from town to town , set up my stall and sold the skills around to whoever . i did nt buy often , but if it impressed me enough , i d buy it from them  i had blank pins and i d bought the skill to enchant them , and it did nt take long . newline newline i was on tour , and a man walked up to my calmly smiling , holding a pin . he smugly put it down on my cart and gestured to it . newline newline  i guarantee you this is the most rare and yet weirdly useful skill you have ever seen . i only need to know if you have the money to buy it .  newline newline i raised an eyebrow at him and folded my arms . i m not so easily conned . newline newline  ah ! you need a demonstration . allow me !  newline newline he took the pin and jabbed himself with the skill . immediately his face was painted white with touches of black lines near the eyes and his lips seemed to seal completely shut . newline newline it was amusing . whatever it was . so i humored him . gesturing for him to go ahead with whatever it was he had planned . newline newline moving over to the side of my cart an empty space he wrapped his arms around the air and mimicked strain , trying to pick something up heavy . i d seen the best comedian skills , but i could nt lie his foolishness made me laugh . newline newline  imagining things that are nt there is rare , but in no way usefu oww !  newline newline he d moved as if he d dropped the heavy object by mistake , and if there had been something there it would have fallen on my foot ... and it bloody well felt like it had ! i stepped back and kicked at whatever it was ... only to find nothing there now . yet the now mute man smugly leans against the apparently tall and heavy invisible object just fine . newline newline i rubbed my foot and watched him , being able to manipulate reality was nt common , and was worth a good amount , but i decided to play it down as if i was nt impressed . newline newline  ok , not bad . but i ve seen similar  what else can you do ?  newline newline the man thought for a moment , then looked over to his shoulder and began to rub at it with a hand , then blow on it insistently yet silently , then flailed around as if on fire . i was bemused until he ran into a guard by mistake  and the guard actually burst into flame at which point the mime grabbed a bucket of water and poured it over his head , no steam or signs of burning on him , although the poor guard was not so lucky as he dived into the town well . newline newline the man walked over with a grin and lied back midair , as if resting against a wall that was nt there for anyone but him . this was swiftly proved to be very real , as the guard emerging from the well threw a dagger at him  and it bounced off the invisible wall . newline newline i took out my needle pouch and offered it to him you could nt steal someones skills unwillingly unless you were a very powerful mage or trickster . he turned around and watched the guard fume for a minute and batter at the thin and invisible wall with his sword before storming off with indignity . after that taking the needle , jabbing himself and taking out a gasping breath and talked again . newline newline  from where i come from . i am known as a grandmaster mime . never ending newline newline newline breathe . 123 newline newline newline ella watched as soft violin notes passed blissfully through the air . cosmic rifts tore in and out of the creamy white sky , and the small sewn cat of her youth tugged at her sleeve . looking down she also could see that she was wearing the same clothes , it was the same clothing every time she came here . a white blouse pulled over black jeans , and red boots with a thick heel . she was lucid dreaming again . or at least that  s what it felt like each time she came here . a perfect world blended from her safest thoughts and memories . from when things were better , from when she wasn  t so alone . the sewn cat continued to tug and pull at her sleeves , gesturing down a beaten path . it motioned . ella followed . newline newline stuffing poked out in tuffs from behind the ragdolls ears , the stitching old and frayed . ella kept passing her eyes over the cat , watching it walk down the path upright , on its stubby back legs . newline the path was lined with floating portraits that held ella  s memories , each one depicting her with her husband . better times , when she didn  t need this dreamscape to not feel so alone . she had walked this dream path before , boot prints stamped into the soft earth . she yearned to come here each night , restlessly wondering if he will come to her in her dreams . this path always led to some small happiness , no matter how fleeting it was . finally the little sewn cat pointed for a break in the tree line , shafts of light illuminating an open grove . rising high in the center of the grass was a great throne of memories and bygone toys and trinkets . atop it sat her angel . sitting on that great pile it looked as though he was touching the stars . tears welled in her eyes as she broke from the trees , the angel jumped to greet her . newline newline he was nothing more than a black silhouette , but he wore a pressed blue suit with a bowtie . and on his back were great wings , they could stretch out to their full length and wrap around ella , engulfing her . and just like that , they embraced , his wings covering her from head to toe . but it was not long before she felt the familiar tug on her sleeve . her friend with the frayed stitching was sitting on an hourglass . the sand was almost out . ella grabbed onto the angels wings , a last hopeful gesture to try and remain there . to stay , and to not have to go back to her pain of being alone . he held a hand on the back of her head , motioning for her to be calm . with ella still holding fast to his wings , the dream started to fade , and the angel with it .

something strange in my pocket , i stuck my hand in and dug out a phone i had never seen before in my life . or at least i somehow believed it was a phone . at first glance this was in fact an unlikely thought , the phone was but a single translucent sheet of soft material that somehow managed to maintain a cardlike shape , yet without any sharp edges , also unable to crease or tear . yet somehow , i knew that it was undoubtedly a phone . newline newline despite my conviction however , i found myself unable to get it to work , there were no buttons anywhere , nor did tapping it , bending it , twisting it , or doing anything else do anything . desperate to get it to work , i drove over to the phone repair shop . in hindsight , it was unlikely they could do anything , nor that they would even consider it a phone , but somehow it seemed like such a natural course of action that i found myself there , yet unable to remember the drive over . newline newline at the counter was a young woman , about my age who gave out this comforting aura that led me to ask her for help , as well as try to get a conversation going . newline newline  so how s business been today ?  i attempted , as i passed over the phone . newline newline  quite slow , in fact , you re our first customer today .  she replied in a soothing voice that i felt almost lulled me to sleep , giving me a smile so natural i managed a smooth smile in response . newline newline as she picked up the phone however , it suddenly lit up , with the words ,  number saved  and began beeping annoyingly . newline newline  beep beep , beep beep  , i awoke with a jolt . newline newline still groggy , i looked up expecting to see the face of that young woman giving me a shocked expression in return . instead i faced an empty wall . newline newline  ... how is it that the best dreams can leave you feeling the worst  i grumbled to myself , picking up my phone to shutoff the alarm . newline newline to my surprise , the alarm had a calendar event attached to it , reading  remember to call 98754123  , a number i had never seen before . in my life .i have nt a clue newline newline  and you say it was the

newline should we find it was anything short of dumb luck i will eat my hood newline newline the books . he cheated . you think him fair , the impartial arbiter of the end of times . in reality , he s

but that stupid horse is hardly equipped with way point markers . the only point of interest that bloody horse understood was  ramtop  .  newline newline even i found him confusing newline newline  he

and i made the outrageous mistake of going grocery shopping at , uh , 5:00pm on a sunday . newline newline r :  oh , that s a nightmare , you ve got to leave the deli counter for later if you re gon na do that .  newline newline n :  i went to the deli counter , and there was this dude up there , and there were about 4 or 5 people in line , so that s a busy deli counter . but the dude that was up there was finishing his order so i was like we good  .  newline newline r :  i m gon na guess he had a hundred things he wanted .  newline newline n :  so the dude hands him like four hundred grams of pastrami , and then he s like anything else , sir ?  and he s like yeah , can i get a couple slices of that corned beef ?  and then he s like yeah , no problem .  , and then i m like okay , you know what ? two kinds of meat . easy there , great gatsby , but uh ... that s okay  .  newline newline r :  it s not over .  newline newline j :  wait , you re not allowed to get two kinds of meat at your deli counter ?  newline newline n :  well then no , it s that he got two kinds of meat for himself as a person . and then  newline newline j :  well , what s wrong with that ?  newline newline r :  he could have a family .  newline newline n :  he got his few slices of pastrami , and then he goes anything else , sir ?  and he s yeah , lem me get a couple of those , uh ... those slices of pepper turkey .  and then he s okay , sir  .  newline newline r :  three meats ? that s strained .  newline newline n :  but it was like a uh ... okay sir .  , like i get it . you want your meat . and then he got like two more things after that ! everyone else is sitting there like oh , my god !  newline newline j :  so you do nt want this guy to get whatever he wants ?  newline newline n :  i want there s an unwritten rule that if there s a line up at the deli counter that you get one , two kinds of meat at the maximum .  newline newline j :  i ve never heard of that rule !  newline newline n :  thats dude . that is just the ... unwritten rule of the deli counter ! newline newline j :  i ve never heard of that .  newline newline r :  how many cheeses did he get , too ?  newline newline n :  gon na need to write it down because of scumbags like you !  newline newline j :  i well ... maybe , cause i never heard of it .  newline newline n :  just getting the prepackaged ?  newline newline j :  no ! nonono , i i ge i get whatever i want , you know , i get i usually get two meats .  newline newline n :  two meats ! what is you put both meats on the same sandwich ? newline newline j :  yes ! yes i do ! i goddamn do !  newline newline n :  k , you know what ? if you re grocery shopping at like 1:00pm on a tuesday , you get two meats , you get four meats ? see if i give a shit .  newline newline r :  you will .  newline newline n :  oh , i will if i m hidin but i ll also be like you know what ? that guy that guy s following the rules . this guy was not following the rules , and you know what i hated is that he then incentivized everyone after him to get more kinds of meat . cause you re standing in line and you re like why wait here for like  newline newline r :  i need to get my time s worth .  newline newline n :  yeah ! i m not  newline newline j :  you do nt want people to be satisfied , do ya  ?  newline newline n :  i m gon na get 400 grams of turkey , 400 grams o 200 grams of turkey , 200 grams of rosemary ham , and throw in a swiss farmer sausage while you re at it .  newline newline j :  i ll throw you into a swiss farmer sausage ...  newline newline n :  that would actually be a punishment because swiss farmer sausages look like big ol  bloody turds .  newline newline r :  ew .  newline newline j :  you look like a big ol  bloody turd .  newline newline n :  sometimes . when it s halloween .  newline newline r :  so , was it because of the fact that it s multiple items or because it was multiple meats ? if he had ordered like , some non , like say some egg salad , and also two meats , would that have lessened the impact ?  newline newline n :  you know what ? it s illogical , but i think it would have . cause i d be like okay . this guy s not just livin  a decadent sandwich life style , you know , built of variety , he s getting like a balanced meal here . maybe he s throwin  a picnic or something like that .  newline newline r :  he s making the plates !  newline newline n :  yeah ! exa he s got multiple dishes that are gon na be done here , like i understand .  newline newline j :  but , no you do nt understand .  newline newline r :  so the reality is you just wan na run this guy s life that you ve never met ?  newline newline n :  no ! i just want him to  newline newline j :  yeah , no you do !  newline newline n :  no , that s not true !  newline newline r :  you wan na tell him it s not okay !  newline newline n :  i want him to have the common decency to not show up at , uh , the busiest time of the grocery store and get an uh outrageous uh you know take up the deli counter s time .  newline newline j :  i do nt know , dude .  newline newline r :  i do nt think it works like that !  newline newline j :  you ve got some sort of , like weird superiority complex .  newline newline n :  that s not a superiority complex thats  newline newline j :  d you think that like everyone s going to be on the same page as you but no one fucking is .  newline newline n :  i want them to fucking treat their fellow  newline newline j :  youre you re like  newline newline n :  it s about respect , okay ?  newline newline j :  some unwritten rule that you made up !  newline newline n :  i want them to treat their fellow man with respect !  newline newline j :  some unwritten rule that you totally created in your mind that no one else to make yourself feel better .  newline newline n :  it s the rules that separate us from the animal kingdom !  newline newline j :  to make yourself feel more superior !  newline newline r :  dude , just walk away from the deli counter for 5 seconds if that bothers you so much .  newline newline n :  i needed the meat ! i did nt wan na lose my place in line to , you know .  newline newline r :  just walk somewhere else and come back !  newline newline j : no , you re so full of you re so far up your ass .  newline newline n :  i did nt wan na lose my place in line to some fucking , oh , johnny can only have ham on mondays and then he needs some fucking , you know , pastrami on wednesdays or he s gon na cry  .  newline newline r :  what if he needed , like , a lowsalt meat for , like , health reasons or something ? newline newline n :  then order one lowsalt meat !  newline newline r :  but his family likes other meat !  newline newline n :  that s acceptable . but , you know , any kinda guy that s getting three types of meat at the deli counter , i do nt think he s got a family .  newline newline r :  oh my god , you re judging his family life too , now .  newline newline j :  i do nt think he s got a family  !  newline newline r :  he s not worthy of love !   newline newline n :  his family is the lunch that he makes on a daily basis .  newline newline j :  you re so far up your own ass .  newline newline n :  what are you talkin  about ? you re just mad because you know i m never ... wrong .  newline newline j :  you re so wrong ! mork , gork and chork were

and sat . he knew what would happen to gork and chork . although he had only been a goblin for a short time , he really did consider them good friends . with no one else in the room , he quietly said

good night sweet prince : newline and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest !  newline newline  newline full disclosure : yes this is very similar to monty python . newlinethe long winter night had been my cover for reaching the guild by morning . i had intended to pass through the little village , it s homes quiet and dark , but warm light still spilled out of the pub , framing drunk farmers as they stumbled towards their homes . as i approached , i felt a power , an energy an energy in my bones , tingling up the back of my spine and flowing down to my fingertips . the quiet of the village gave way to cries , pleas , desperate voices calling out for help . how could i refuse ? the guild was nt going anywhere . newline newline the ruins were nt difficult to find , just downstream of the village itself , the tumbled stones and fallen pillars overgrowing with grass and bushes marked out a much more ancient settlement . the square foundations of houses surrounded a larger building , a temple , in the centre of which still stood an alter , now under the branches of a willow rather than the high beams of a vaulted ceiling . the alter concealed a mechanism , but it s rusted gears had seized long ago , so i removed the stone slabs , already displaced by the willow s roots , to reveal the narrow stairs down to the ancient catacombs . newline newline the deep dark of the underground room hid them  the bones of the ancients  carefully stacked and preserved in the style of the first empire . their cries called out to me , they felt my presence , yearned to live again , jealous of the drunken farmers squandering their short lives , desperate to see once more the light of the sun . i drew up the power within , and it crashed like a tidal wave into the cold , tingling energy of death which hung around my physical form , bursting forth into streaks of blue lightning which illuminated the pillars and alcoves , the chambers , coffins and dried bones . yes , i would help them to live again . newline newline no commands , or controls were necessary , their souls only needed the point of entry , the breach , from which they could spill from the afterlife . my very presence here , in this secluded domain of the long dead , weakened the veil , and it was child s play to direct and flow the currents of magic to a pinprick point , a breach , a hole into the beyond . my power rushed in and pushed out , widening the gap , and acting as a beacon for those desperate , pleading voices . a wave , a torrent of souls flooded the room , crashing against the pillars , seeking and swirling , finding their graves and bodies . i bathed in their pasts , the memories and feelings , their voices and emotions washing over me . newline newline a living soul caught my attention , shining bright amongst the flowing energy , i turned back to the entrance , expecting one of the farmers , out for a late night stroll . instead stood a witchunter from the guild , crossbows ready , blessed silver bolts loaded , blocking the exit . had they known i was coming for them ? how long had he been shadowing me ? or had he been in the village , sensing my presence as i drifted past , entranced by the call of the dead ? i doubted he would give me the opportunity to ask , and was proven correct as he raised his bows . newline newline  abomination !  he cried ,  necromancer ! lich ! the god of life abhors you !  newline newline i knew the words , the curse they were bound by their order to utter , to lend blessing to the kill . before he could utter the next sentence , i drew the power into my fists , manifesting as gleaming blue electricity , i flung it towards him as thundering , flashing bolts of energy . the crackling energy burst against him and his spasming muscles let fly the silver crossbow bolts which flew wide , impacting in the wall behind me . he recovered , dropping the bows and i knew he was no novice  too many had fallen before me while struggling in vain to reload their precious blessed bolts . newline newline he drew his blade , engraved with the symbols of the seven gods it could banish the undead . if they were sufficiently weakened . he moved faster than i expected , and the shining blade burned as it scraped against my old bones . switching footing he pressed the advantage , connecting again . stunned , i projected magic outwards as a wall of force and noise , shaking the stones , toppling ancient pillars and sending showers of dust all around as the room reverberated with the booming roar of power . he stumbled backwards in shock and nearly fell , i readied another bolt of lightning but he dived aside before i cast it , so i slipped back into the darkness , reigning in the cracking magic , bending space and afterlife , concealing it in a shroud of death itself . darkness consumed the room again , but i could see the glowing , living soul . now we would fight on my terms . newline newline i saw him fumble in his clothing , finding an enchanted torch . he spoke a word and it burst to life , but it s orange glow did nt reach my position . i toyed and plucked and folded at the space , turning the light back round , concentrating it in a smaller circle , deepening the shadows of the catacombs . he was scared now , i could sense it . i considered hiding for a few minutes , perhaps racing past him , unnerving him into making mistakes . fear would be my ally . but i remembered the souls , freshly plucked , seeping back into their old bodies , glowing a dim blue in my vision , almost hidden by the bright glow of the living hunter . i reached my power back out to them  now they were here , they only needed a little more , just a little magic to bind their bones together and contain their souls once more . newline newline soon their scraping , rattling , chattering bones caused a dusty cacophony to echo in the room , and i saw the hunter , turning this way and that , trying to find the source of the noise all around him . soon the first skeletons took shape , rising up , standing to attention , their souls calling out to me : thank you master ! what is your will ?  newline newline and i replied : kill this mortal .  newline newline i retreated to an alcove and watched with amusement as the skeletons raised towards him from all sides , more and more of them raising up from the bone hoard . the hunter cut down the first one , then the first dozen , but they were overwhelming him now  rushing in from all sides , cackling , chattering , clawing at him with skeletal fingers , gouging his eyes , tearing at his flesh , soon he fell , surrounded on all sides by my legion . and soon he stood again , sword in hand , ready now to serve , not to hunt . this is chet ubetcha reporting live from honko s house of horrors and costume supply store where hundreds of costumed citizens have been turned into the costume they were wearing at the time . newline newline this , of course , has resulted in numerous injuries . hundreds have reported knife wounds , lacerations , and decapitations . luckily , there are now thousands of new slutty nurses available to treat the injuries , and sew back any lost limbs . newline newline of greater concern are the hordes of small , adolescent dinosaurs that are now roaming the suburban areas , tearing through the living pumpkins and black cats that are also in abundance . the newly formed committee of jedi clones have promised to combat the threat , but are still divided over who is the real luke skywalker and if they should be fighting the darth vaders instead . newline newline in addition , the new sorority of faeries , angels and princesses has claimed the entire university campus as their kingdom and have enslaved both the cheap ghosts and vampires under their rule . newline newline this is chet ubetcha , who dressed like a cartoon reporter to make his daughter happy , and now has to go home to a small dinosaur chewing on his couch , wishing you good luck out there and do nt let the zombies bite . i sometimes feel like i should be dead . there is always that question , nagging at me , every single moment of every single day why ? why not me ? i had died after i entered that place , that place , i ca nt even say the name without shaking , am i really as brave as they say ? i am scared of my memories . i am scared of my father too , that one day he will turn to me and say that he wishes my sister could have taken my place , my mother perhaps . he always said she was his true love , although i remember some arguments , and i , i , his little bookish girl , survived when his hale , strong , alive wife did nt ? once he confessed he felt well , not similar . newline newline i survived . i write this in you every day , but it s to remind me . i survived . i do not need the food in the pantry because i will not starve . i do not need to keep old clothing for fear of never having it again . i do not need to wash all my clothes and iron all my clothes every day for fear of being dirty . that sounds stupid , maybe , but it s the dirt , the grime , it feels like it clings to me . i saw people die and yet it s being unclean that i am terrified of . it was the grey and the dirt , those are my main memories , of that place i mean , and what contrast was that to the clean , tidy little attic , to our old little home , the housework always done perfectly . newline newline emigrating to america , emigrating to america was not like i thought it would be . i did nt think it would be like anything , actually . i expected to die , or it was more than that . i knew i would die then , i knew i would die before having children , before leaving that place , before living my life . i knew that my life would be short and grey and painful and hopeless and i did nt want it , i so desperately wanted to believe that was nt how it would end , but i knew it would . and then and then it did nt . we were reunited , my father and me , while we were still staying in that place , after it had been liberated . where else could we go ? where else could the thousands of people go ? we were thin and desperate and we knew we could nt go home , to the neighbours who wanted us dead , to the streets filled with ghosts . i met a girl , from belarus , and she said her family had ended up in a work camp . they had built roads , she said . if she came back , she d be travelling on the roads they died to build . some just stayed , though . in a nearby town . not because they wanted to , but because they did nt know what to do . because they knew they would die and then they did not and now they were living in a country which hated them . newline newline first , we went to italy . there were displaced person camps , that was what we called , displaced persons , or dps . as if we d been lost by accident , and we d be found down the back of a sofa or under the bed . i know my mother is ashes , now , she died and she was burnt and even though i do nt , ca nt , believe any more , i still mourn for that . because there is no whole body left like our law states . no one tore clothes for her . there is no grave for me to place stones for . there is just ash . her ashes are displaced , i suppose , somewhere in the wind , but we were forced out and away and into camps . some people called them survivors camps , because we d survived this , this cleansing of europe , of the jews and the gypsies and so many more , but no one survived completely . newline newline i know i recount the story to you every single day , but it s to show me that it s real . from italy , to israel . israel ! the holy land , the land people were desperate to see . my mother will never step foot on the holy land . the holy land ? what holy land is this ? the site where the romans slaughtered us ? the site where we chased out of , forced out of ? the site where , even during our own suffering in that place , pogroms were still ongoing , in the streets of jerusalem ? we are a cursed people and we come from a cursed people . newline newline we actually left to america not long after . america , freedom , hope , that is what is said about it . the statue of liberty , a shining beacon for the huddled masses . and me , within them , i suppose , but the huddled masses sounds too broad . every person in the huddled mass has a story and feelings and personalities , it is not a huddled mass , cowering together , it is people who have railed and fought and survived . i did not rail and fight , i suppose , but i survived . newline newline we wanted to live on a kibbutz but in the end it was the we which meant we could not . we meant my father and me . us . instead , it was both of us , two , a father and a daughter , sister less , motherless , wifeless , daughter less . dusty and dry and so much work . we were tired . my father had been used almost as a slave . we could not live on a small dusty hill and farm . my father managed to find employment through a friend we had made in the camp , and so we left . newline newline and today , today in my 30s . today , i have campaigned . i came here and suddenly my world was nt divided into jew or not , into enemy of the nazis or not , into survivor or not , it was black or white , coloured or not . and my father s friend , he said , at least they are not starving or locked up or made to wear badges ! badges ? they are marked out by the colour of their skin like we were with our yellow stars on the camp s clothes . just because they are not dying and who is to say they are not ? forced into poverty and crime , many are suffering , surely does not mean we can ignore it . no , they were not being starved , but they were being denied jobs . no , they were not locked up in work camps , instead many black people were , are , trapped in poverty instead . newline newline of course , there was a problem . how could i , how could i do something ? i was eighteen , by the time we we reached america , and i wanted to go to college and have a husband . i wanted children , then , but not now , not any more , because i ve watched my father as he grieves and i do not want to risk that , ever , i can not bear to risk that loss and pain . i fear by being born jewish , he will suffer . by being born jewish , he will be cursed . newline newline i did not want to mark myself out . and people would have told me to be grateful . you are complaining about the society which accepted you , they d say . you should be grateful . i am not grateful , but should i be ? my father works hard and pays taxes and he benefits your country . we require no assistance or help . it was not you personally who liberated the camp , was it ? i am not in debt to you . if i saved someone s life , i would not want them to be in debt to me . it is simple human decency and i would not want them to have to repay me for something as simple , as basic , as that , for something anyone should have done . and i think they should have done it but for many years i felt like i could not criticise anything , because i should be grateful for being alive , for being in an attic not a camp , for being in a work camp not a death camp , for being in a refugee camp not a morgue , for being in israel and not dead , for being in america and not be starving . newline newline that was not the only problem . yes , i knew it was wrong but i was also afraid . how could they accept me when they could not accept black people ? people born and raised there , who s grandparents were born and raised there , were less accepted in white society than me , a jewish immigrant . that is not to say i never experienced anti semitism , quite the opposite in fact , america was not exactly free of anti semitism , but if they could turn on their own people , then why not on me , on us ? if i spoke out , would they come for me too ? newline newline and , of course , i am not black . i joined forces with thomas rudwell , and his group . he was born next to a house with a nice family living in it , or so he said . i do nt know as i never met them . then their son , martin he was called , was stabbed walking home from work . he mouthed off , said something the murderers did nt like , whatever . eye witnesses saw everything . some even told it in court . but the murderers were nt sentenced , no , they were let off , and thomas knew it was because martin s life just did nt matter . newline newline i was in some ways a poster girl . who could say no to the comparisons i drew between my past and their current ? between the othering of their own people . were black people so dirty we could not drink water with them ? i had been called a dirty jew . would they call me one ? of course , many did . and i was not a leading force , no . thomas did what he wanted and i said mostly what he wanted , but i was white and people were more likely to listen to me . a whole lot of black people did nt want a white girl campaigning on their behalf and i get why . i was campaigning for women s rights as well . equal pay and equal respect . where were the women bankers ? the doctors ? the politicians ? that , i could be more vocal about . being a woman meant i was a victim of that system , but for racism and civil rights dealing with that , i was just a poster girl , more than anything . newline newline today . the rally . the rally was great . there was shouting and cheering and then thomas stood up and his speech his speech . i ca nt write it all down here as i ve got to go to sleep soon , but i dream the same dream as him . women and men , black and white . i tell myself i want jewish descendants of survivors to shake hands with descendants of nazis but i do nt . is that wrong ? it s wrong , i suppose . maybe that means thomas is better than me , and that s probably true . i should have died when i was fifteen and yet i am alive and i m still just as flawed . newline newline  note , this was based on my gran s experiences during the war . she did nt come to america though , but went from belarus through to italy to israel  . you love johnny depp !  my mother wanted me to be excited , so badly . newline newline it s true , i did . but here i was , no eyebrows , no eyelashes , not a single hair on my head . i just got done throwing up the lunch i forced myself to eat . in an hour i d force myself to drink a shake . i d throw it up in front of a different celebrity . i did nt want to see johnny depp . newline newline he came , though , and shook my hand . he signed some things and told me i was beautiful . he asked about my treatment , he asked if it sucked . he tried to relate to me , tried to be a cool guy , i could tell . newline newline a few days later the avengers made an appearance . i got to smile and take a picture with robert downey jr . he told me i was beautiful . he asked about my treatments . newline newline i was on a morphine drip when i got to meet my favorite author , sarah dessen . she was funny , and she told me i was beautiful . she asked me about my treatments . newline newline why do they all assume i want to be told i m beautiful ? is it so clear i do nt agree with that statement at all ? newline newline if it s so clear i feel ugly , it should be clear i do nt want to hear fake declarations of my beauty . newline newline i met a band later . i do nt remember who . i think that was day three of my morphine . i tried to ask my mom later who it was , but she did nt remember the band either . she did remember what they had said to me  that i was beautiful . newline newline they must know i m dying . i wonder if they know it ll be a closed casket funeral ? i wonder if they d still call me beautiful then ? newline newline because as close as i am to death , i know now what i ll look like . i ll be skin and bones . i ll have raccoon eyes . i ll have something disgusting trailing from my mouth when they pull my dead body from this bed . newline newline only my family will know how truly bad i look before i die . newline newline so many girls would kill to hear the avengers call her beautiful . once , i would have too . newline newline except now i ca nt help but wish one of them had said something like ,  you look alive .  newline newlineshould one sit down and count all the problems in the world , the number would be the same . every day . the problems may be different , but their sum is the same . it has always been this way . times of war or times of peace make a little difference for the due audience we call mankind . when we actually have least to worry about , we tend to worry the most . just as dictators create their own enemies , we create our own problems in absense of real ones . not everyone sees this . newline newline as chance would have it , most of western world is cursed with the mediocrity . blessed are those who lack a job , family , house , wealth , health or any other myriad goals we strive for . as animals we were made to move . move towards something , everything , all of it . most thorough punishment for a rolling stone is to stand still in content . young , beautiful and successful beings find themselves shaming theirselves , complaining , being obnoxius . pondering how cruel their life may be , forcing them to spend their time with their friends , celebrate , leave their mind idle . having a good time without motive to have one . obnoxious , yet human . right there is a fine name for the history of our kin . newline newline no heroes to be found here , but heroes are not the ones perfect world needs . heroes are not needed when everything is right , but feels wrong . times like that require no solution , they require a scapegoat . nothing is more beautiful than hating oneself in spite of everything you are . or so they say . it makes people , even friends , great annoyance . their need for a villains makes them the most boring kind of villains  villains who only haunt themselves . now , villains are not made with that goal in mind . villains are performers for wider audience . no heroes without villains . become the villain , become a hero . offering for the lesser folk . newline newline when people need a a vent for their discontent in their lack of real problems , they do not seek a hero . they seek a villain . they may not know it and would be even less eager to admit it , but it s the unbiased truth . as unbiased as biased truths are . it is wrong to give them what they want , for people rarely know what they truly want . it is cruel . playing the villain , creating a problem for others to deal with . exactly what they want and need . should their opinion be asked , they would call it cruel and unnecessary . a  thank you  would be equally suitable , but gratitude is not a uniform i m accustomed to wearing . my uniform has been the role of a villain in times of need . it is not role that receives praise , but a role that slowly eats away your standing and happiness . yet it offers others what they truly need . a crack in the perfectly dull portrait . newline newline like soldiers who have walked through too many wars , seasoned villains grow brittle . the uniform is not made for everyone to wear . it is uniform most would find unnecessary . still it is the uniform people are trying to see in the bars and alehouses . uniform they recognize and subconciously greet . they need it . true hero may be villain to his friends . if time comes , i may once again put that uniform back on , and do it again . nobody else will .the world was dark.it felt meticulously maddening but that was nothing new to ned.he was blind but nevermind.this was accepted by him long ago in a distant memory when he was touched by god.the room he was in felt cavernous and cold.he could hear the slight whirred of the airconditioner and taste the metallic air of the sterile room.but there was something more , something hidden and subtle like a whisper of substances that procreates a sense of falling endlessly through an abyss.the flow of the world felt interrupted against it.warped it into something of its own . newline newline newline he tried feeling for it but was lost like trying to grip shadows and letting water flows uninterrupted through his closed fist.even in doing this he felt terrified and unclean as if he had disturbed an evil ... no , not evil.it felt like nature , it felt grey and unstoppable.it felt as if he had intrude in a holy sanctity that worships the wind and sunlight and all those that it encompasses . newline newline newline the man that had spoken earlier was gone leaving a slimmer of his presence behind.he has been touch.this revelation came like lightning and turmoils in his hollow stomach.the man s essence was tainted by  it  , forever changed.yet , ned does not regret this change had happen to the man.he had spoken with thunderous voice that carried a commanding tone like an ancient god whose name had been forgotten.this too , ned had felt , been touched by  it  .the words that were carried by the thunder was this :  what i m about to show you is so top secret that we had to invent a new security clearance level for it !  .he had left soon afterward . newline newline newline he was riding home on the subway when he was taken.the compartments of the trains had always felt like decadent and trivialities to him.rot that was not visible had sullied the train , like an open arm of beggar and rat kings that reigned supreme.but today it was different somehow.the aura had warped and bend to a new presence.a team of armed and suited mens had rushed the train during the first stop.he could smell the oil and gunpowder of the gun and heard the ruffle of the shirts.one of the mens had grip his right bicep with an iron grip and proceeded to cart him off the train and haul him to a foreign room that had taste of metal and touched by something old.he had protest but that too was trivial.and here we are . newline newline newline while he was revisiting these events , he felt gently nudged at first but was rocked stupidly by something.his mind , so sharp so as to be able to cut other untrained hearts and minds is now babbling incoherently in the foreground and background.this wall of noises was superceded by ...  it  .the man was back and he had carried a new wonder with him.he had brought back a sense to ned.through the tears that he felt wetting his eyes and cheeks , he found light that blind him.this ball of light that awaits him was wispy and flowing continously in an unrecognised patterns that was beautiful in its abstract and chaotic nature.he reached out to it like a man dying of thirst reaching for something far beyond him.to his amazement he touched the light.it was solid but not to his hand that lay solemnly at his side now but it in his mind.the wall of noise had vanished and replaced by something wondrous.to his suprise , he was calm in glimpsing all of eternities : the past and the future intermingling in his mind.and he know he was chosen , not today but the since the beginning of time . newline newline newline do you see ? , the man and  it  has asked . newline newline newline yes , we had answered . newline newline newline then let there be light . newline newline newline edit : a sentence .we can hear their drums in the distance . their footsteps shake the ground . they will be here soon . newline newline as we look over the castle wall , we can see their torches light the night . all around me i hear armor rattling and whispered prayers . my men are scared , but steadfast . newline newline i begin to tighten the straps on my armor . anything to distract me from the reality of the situation . i am scared too , but i must not show it . my men need hope . newline newline  ready arrows !  i yell as loud as my lungs will let me in the cold night air . newline i look out into the night . they are nearly upon us and they are in range . newline  fire ! !  newline newline the air is filled with the whooshing of arrows and the twang of bowstrings . soon we hear their screams . the arrows found their mark . newline newline they return fire . the sky is lit up with the flames on the end of their arrows . they plan to set the city on fire . my men are rushing around in terror , but still the arrows eventually fall and reek havoc on my beautiful city . they do nt want control of the city or to make slaves out of my people ... they want to send a message . newline newline before long they are at the gate , their numbers are just too many . newline i hear the battering ram slam against our last defense over and over . newline newline  we must fight on men !  i yell .  for the good of our people , fight till the last breath ! newline newline the gate is in rough shape , but still holding . everyone who is not working on barricading the inner door is using the time to tend to the wounded , put out fires , and prepare themselves for what is coming . newline newline  hold you ground men ! we will hold them here ! they will not reach the keep !  newline newline as the first rays of sunlight creep over the castle wall , the gate is breached . my men yell the fiercest battle cry they can muster , they are prepared to die for their city , their families , and for me . newline newline for a split second after the gate falls , the two armies just stare at each other in silence . the time has come . newline newline what is happening ? they are retreating ? why ? they have us beaten , there is no where for us to run ! newline newline my men and i watch as every last enemy disappears into the horizon . newline newline my exhausted brain ca nt begin to understand what just transpired . but , for now , i am thankful . newlinei sat up in the room , my eyes struggling to adjust to the light . as i finally adjusted , i realized i was sitting in a comfy armchair facing a fireplace , which was burning with a cool blue glow . i looked to my left , and the man looked back at me . he was about seventy or eighty , the look in his eyes a mixture of pity and contemplation , as if he was an official that was trying to find the best way to tell me how badly i d messed up this time . newline newline  so you have awoken ,  was all he said , his voice deep , hearty and fulfilled , like a man who spent his life laughing ,  how was your life ?  he asked , leaning forward . newline newline  life ?  i asked ,  then , are you god ? you do nt seem very powerful to me .  newline newline the man laughed , a beautiful sound , as if apollo and his choir had descended to earth along with a band of yahweh s angels to orchestrate it . he very well could have made a living by laughing .  no , i am not a god ,  he chuckled ,  though i believe i remember reading  something like that in the past   http : www.galactanet.comoneofftheeggmod.html  ...  newline newline  then what are you ?  i asked ,  and where is this ? why am i here ? do you expect me to simply talk about my life to a strange man in a strange house ? how long have i been here ?  newline newline the man looked at me , a confused look on his face ,  i suppose i should not have expected that from the is . very well , i shall offer you a deal . for every question i answer , you shall offer one of mine . is that acceptable ?  newline newline i considered the question , sizing the man up . although he seemed a kindly old man , he had still kidnapped me and kept me in this room prisoner for who knows how long . he had probably more than enough to think up the questions that would get the most out of me before taking whatever drugs had kept me asleep away from me . except my hands were unbound , my clothes were freshly laundered , and it seemed that the clothes had been made especially for me . i looked up at him , looking into his eyes that were a pool of blue that shifted slowly to green then back again , as if they could nt decide which was more beautiful . his hair was a soft gray color , almost white , and his face had been recently shaven .  i suppose i could agree to that ,  i said , choosing my words as if numbers for a password . newline newline  excellent !  he exclaimed ,  now , since you have answered that question , i shall answer one of yours . i believe your first question was what am i ? that one is easy , i am you , or at least , the you that could have , should have been . i lived to be three hundred and forty three years old , but everyone keeps telling me i look only two hundred of those . during my lifetime , i created a vaccine against death , a small red pill i like to call , the stone of nicholas flamel  . just one a day keeps death at bay !  i was a billionaire , a savior , a hero celebrated across the land . i only made one mistake in my lifetime .  newline newline  what was  i started , forgetting all about my circumstances . newline newline  uhuhuhh !  the man interrupted me ,  i still have nt heard how your life was .  newline newline  it was short ,  i found myself saying ,  i was born in  as i continued my tale , memories began to come back to me , like old toys that had been discarded by accident , then found in the attic many years later as you cleaned out your house . i remembered elementary school , my first failure , middle school , my first crush , my first true friend . i remembered high school , i remembered my teachers , my enemies , my sadness , my happiness . all these memories came flooding back to me , as if i had accidentally pulled the plug on the world  s oceans then stood under the ensuing deluge , and all of these memories came pouring into me , and i told the man everything . the story of how i had embarrassed myself once in a grocery store , how i had hardened myself to happiness in a misguided attempt to become stronger , how i had played with love as if it was a stick , to be directed at whomever i wanted , how i hated myself for existing , how i cried myself dry on my friends lap . all these stories and more came flooding out of my mouth , and then ,  i jumped in front of the two of them . that s the last memory i have .  i looked at the old man , and saw that his eyes were streaming tears , his eyes filled to the brim with sadness and respect . as i stood up to try and apologize , he waved me down , tears still streaming down his face . newline newline  i have talked to every single version of us ,  he began ,  and until now , each of us has believed that i was the best version , that i was the greatest , the best , the one that should have been , all ten million , four hundred thousand , and eighty four of us . until now . you may have started out the worst , the most horrible , disgusting lowlife that ever crawled or walked this planet . you formed ideas that would endanger millions , and hated yourself purely for existing . i admit , when you started , i thought that you would be just like so many others , selfish and weak . you would have asked what my one mistake was . i ll show you .  he walked over to a bookshelf , and pulled out an old newspaper clipping , handing it to me . newline newline as i looked at the paper , i realized that it was the front page of the issaquah times  , the local newspaper in my area . the title read , shooting at local high school kills twenty  . as i looked down , i saw the pictures on the page flickering , as if shifting between realities . one second , it was me and another student i had seen in my final moments . the next , it was my two best friends .  i ... i do nt understand ,  i said ,  what happened ?  newline newline the man leaned down , and gave me the warmest hug i had ever felt , his warm tears streaming off his face onto my shoulder ,  you did it , my boy . you did what ten million , four hundred thousand , and eighty three different versions of us never could , making slightly different choices , doing slightly different things . you saved them .  newlinei was 18 in 2009 when the event occured . newline newline nothing happened at first , everyone reveled in their new found abilities , we were just like the deities that we had once worshipped . newline newline slowly however , we grew detached from our humanity.the need for sustenance , sleep , love and care left us . slowly but surely we transcended , those of us who were not affected by the genetic shift were swiftly eliminated , we considered it a mercy to them . they need nt need to live amongst the gods , to tremble in our shadows.we had not eliminated all of them but it was enough that we considered it a cleansing . newline newline to think there was once a time where silly insignificant crimes such as genocide or murder even existed.following the cleansing we created the world in our image , we advanced far more than the unaffected could have ever done so and we created a utopia where we ruled.we called this utopia olympus for it was a truly a pantheon , a celestial city created solely for the residency of the gods . newline newline there were those of us who retained our humanity , those of us who felt remorse , fear , horror and indignation at the atrocities that we were committing . those amongst us that felt this way were exiled from olympus , as nomads tasked to travel the world forever living in the shadow of the colossal undertaking that had levelled the world of all those we considered impure . newline newline ultimately however , it was our pride and hubris that lead to the fall . newline newline at some point in time during our campaign to systematically rid the world of those who were not of divine appointment we noticed that we could not spawn younglings , it had not mattered then because everyone who was like us , did not realise the gravity of what that meant . newline newline we were selfish , we were reckless , we did nothing to further anything but our own goals newline newline the rule of the gods lasted another 60 years before we finally noticed that something had gone horrendously wrong , one of the others became unresponsive , catatonic if you will.we had noticed that over time we had gotten slower but we dismissed it , we never considered the grim reality . newline newline it did not take very long for the rest of us to realise that despite our ageless shells our bodies were still slowly but surely degenerating.just like those who were unaffected , we had realized too late that we were far more human than we would ever have imagined . newline newline unfortunately during all this time , we had grown stupid , we had left our mortal intelligence behind and swapped it for divine pride.none of us knew how to fix what would eventually destabilize our rule . newline newline i now think back to the time where one of the nomads turned up at the gates of olympus spouting rubbish and nonsense about aging and how we were all doomed to be  locked in  and that he had the cure and it lay in human science . we scoffed and threw the doomsayer out and spat and hurled abuse at he who we considered weak for the consorted with those we considered undesirables . newline newline now i see the true irony of divine intelligence , we purport that we know all but we are but men . we are fallible and we have caused the downfall of humanity and we would be forever forced to observe from our mortal shells as gaia took the earth back from us . newline newline as i lay here , my mind trapped in my mortal husk.i can only feel more human as the days pass.as my immortality would eventually become the prison in which my soul would be eternally trapped in.i ve gone sane and insane multiple times , i think ive seen what god is and what we are all here for.i think this is purgatory , i cant see and i think ive been here forever . newline newline i think im ready to die , but i can not . newline newline i hope that the next inhabitants of the earth will be able to free my mind from this mortal shell , that i may speak forth the warnings of our ways.to perhaps right the wrongs we have once done . newline newline newline i am now 841 years oldthe first era was a time of hardship for the egyptians , a near sighted captain mistook newline an ethiopian warrior for a barbarian and attacked him , an accidental declaration of war . this was largely due to the ominous red icon floating above the warriors head , being similar in colour and shape to that of a barbarian . after numerous battles lasting whole decades at a time peace finally returned , after only 120 years , this was the shortest known war in history . as egypt progressed wonders became more common than housing , this created an element of reality some called tourism , most commoners were unfamiliar with the meaning of this word as the empires literacy rate was only 12 percent . newline newline over in a land of america across a great ocean sat the great american city of asstit . where , after a century of research , their leader , washington the terrible had discovered what the paper blocks collecting dust behind him in his office were for , and so writing was born . newline newline coincidentally back in egypt they were developing the same technologies , the only difference between the two empires was the golden box the egyptians towed behind their horses . newline newline with only one city , the kingdom of the zulus sat on a small island completely covered by their pride and joy , the great impi warrior . luckily the zulus had chosen the honour social policy , this helped them grow their fearsome impi army . the zulus had recently discovered animal husbandry , however they surprisingly had no animals that could be effected by this technology on the island . this made the zulus unhappy . all of these nations left behind relatively short legacy as their reign was cut short by our great leader , the great nuclear peacemaker , ghandi .i have been inside my apartment building for 4 months now . every day i wake up to the sound of my alarm . my generator has definitely come in handy these past months . every day i force myself to keep resetting that alarm because if i do not , i can not fully convince myself that i have a normal life . newline newline what consists of a normal life ? a job ? eating regular meals ? having friends ? certainly those are things that were deemed as normal before all hell broke loose . but now i ca nt consider those things normal . now , i can only set my daily morning alarm and go through my daily routine as if i can not hear the screaming , moaning and death cries through my boarded up windows . newline newline i know that the zombies will never get to me . something very odd happens when they get within six feet of me . they just freeze and go rigid for a few seconds . then they back away and leave as quickly as they had come . i must have some sort of immunity to them and it saved my life 4 months ago during the zombie break in of our building . everybody was infected but me , i was quick to find out that there were no survivors . i ran and i ran until i became cornered into a hallway . i remember my life flashing before my eyes . and letting out that final shriek before i watched the zombie freeze . but why did it freeze ? newline newline to this day i do nt know why it did nt infect me . i ve come up with a million possible and impossible reasons and i m never any closer to finding the truth . i know that i need to go out there and find the answer myself . why should i be worried ? surely my immunity will keep me safe . but it is not the zombies i am afraid of . it is the carnage on the streets that leaves me gasping awake in panic in the middle of the night . the thought of seeing halfeaten faces and deformed bodies with missing limbs is enough to turn me away from ever leaving my apartment building . newline newline but i know that i will have to leave some day . every day i break into the other rooms in the building and gather food and supplies to bring back to my own room . the apartment building is big and has many rooms and so far has sustained me easily , but it can not last . i will need to leave and find the answer to my immortality . newline newline for now , i will continue to set my alarm and live my panicstricken life . it is way i can convince myself life is still normal . newlinei am a soldier . a killingmachine  no more natural than a robot or a car or glyphostat resistant crops are . i was created to kill and kill i did . newline newline then came the end . when conventional arms failed the world turned to nuclear arms . no nation can be blamed  we all pressed the big bad button at the same time or caused the others to do so by our own pressing . newline newline after the world had ended i did not want to fight any longer . i did not long for other survivors  i only longed for peace and tranquility . i survived the fallout and the nuclear winter in a secluded valley and in time i left to set up my farm somewhere in a great , flat steppe . i stayed on my farm for so long , a forest grew like a fence around my farmstead . sometimes i would go to a village two days of superhuman travel away to trade  but not more often than maybe once a decade or so . in time my small farm was surrounded by an ancient forest instead of the wide plains it had once been nestled in : an island of humanity in a sea of green . newline newline my old name i have long forgotten  my old nation is not even a shadow of a memory for me . i have seen countless living things bloom and wither  i have witnessed more ages die than i care to count . newline newline i am ancient and wise and powerful  i am sorrowful and lonely and full of regrets  i am lighthearted and capering and friendly . newline newline as this age enters its fall , its last moment of blazing glory , i was given new name to hail me with : newline newline call me tom bombadil newline newlinethe small led was blinking at a regular , measured pace . servers were humming , and the pressure in the room was intense . charlie was staring at the led , not blinking . what is going to happen ? newline newline the first launch of ai was the event they all have been preparing for for years . he fantasized about this moment every time he went to sleep for the past decade . but now he could not enjoy it or feel it or experience anything . he just stared at the blinking light feeling emptiness in his stomach . if they ve made a mistake , he has just destroyed the humanity . newline newline all of the sudden he has heard thunder , and then unhumanly screams , as if some gigantic creatures beyond mortal imagination were dying in agony . then  nothing . the light kept blinking . everyone in the room stood , frozen . newline newline suddenly , he felt something . he felt as if his mind has expanded , as if ... . as if for the first time in his life he looked ahead and had a choice , as if he could control what is going to happen to him in the future . newline newline huh , he thought , i guess that is what free will feels like .you do nt often see scars on people s faces . they only appear there with the most transparent of lies , lies that can be seen through in an instant . i have only ever met one person with a scar on their face and i doubt that i will ever be able to forget them . newline newline her name was quincy , and the first time i saw her was when she walked into my high school chemistry class halfway through senior year . at that point , her scar was small , a scratch on her cheek . that day it was still bleeding . before then , i always worked alone as our class had an odd number of students and there were always complaints about groups of three being unfair . when quincy showed up , i finally had a lab partner . she did nt talk much , and when she did it was in a quiet voice with only the slightest trace of some accent that i could nt quite place . another odd thing i noticed as we worked together was that she had no scars on her hands or her legs , at least not any that were visible . she was an anomaly to say the least . newline newline as time passed , our friendship grew and so did quincy s scar . i earned my fair share of small nicks on my hands , lying about my grades being fine and my homework being done , the normal sort of things that teenagers would lie about , but i never earned a scar on my face . every day , i would ask quincy how she was doing , and she would always smile brightly at me and respond with  i m vertical and ventilating ! how are you ?  it was another odd detail about her , one that i could nt quite figure out . newline newline that second half of the school year flew by , and graduation eventually came . quincy had never spoken about college , so i had accepted that we probably would nt see each other after that final ceremony . i so desperately wanted to ask about her scar , which had grown the whole way from her chin to her eyebrow on the right side of her face . it was oddly shaped too , there were patches of clear skin in it , as though several lies had formed into one . i did nt get to ask quincy about her scar that day . she did not come to graduation , opting to have her diploma mailed to her rather than walking the stage . we had never exchanged phone numbers , and she made no attempts to stay in touch over the summer . when the day came for me to finally move into my dorm , i had come to terms with the fact that i would never know about quincy s mysterious scar . at this point , i wish i had been correct . newline newline the first day of classes , i had a writing course that all freshmen were required to take . i arrived very early and got a seat in the front of the room . not two minutes later , the seat next to me squeaked backwards and a familiar voice asked me how my day was . i turned to answer quincy , ecstatic that we had met again , but her appearance made me pause . she had shaved her hair on the right side of her head , and her scar had climbed almost to reach the peak of it . when i paused , she looked away , ashamed . i told her i was doing well , and when i returned the question she surprised me with a new answer . she was doing awful , she told me , her aunt that had taken her in when her parents passed had gotten into a bad car accident and died along with her two children . i offered my condolences , but quincy just smiled sadly and turned away . newline newline our friendship continued , we studied together often , and she helped edit my papers . i found out that she wanted to be a writer and had been too afraid to tell me because of the reactions she had gotten from other people . we started dating over the summer between freshman and sophomore years . quincy s scar was still growing , and it scared me , but i loved her . newline newline one day , we were meant to go to the movies together , but she had a tendency to forget plans , especially when they were made in the spur of the moment . i showed up at her apartment . she rented a loft in a larger home . i let myself in and could immediately tell that something was wrong . quincy loved animals , and had opted to live an extra twenty minute walk away from most of her classes just to find an apartment where she could get a dog . her german shepherd s name was sonia , and she was quite excitable , but the house was dead silent when i walked in . i did a quick search of the house , going out into the backyard where sonia spent most of her day when it was nice out . the poor thing had chewed her way into the plastic shed and eaten antifreeze . she had died in her favorite spot under a tree . i turned back into the house and started up the stairs , tentatively calling for quincy . when i reached the ladder to the loft , i could hear a soft dripping noise . i quickly climbed the ladder and pushed open the hatch to the loft . the dripping was louder . newline newline quincy was dangling from a rope tied to the rafters in the middle of her loft . the dripping was coming from the now gaping wound on her face . i have never seen a lie cut so deeply , but this one had cut her the whole way down to the bone . it was when i tore my eyes away from the gruesome sight of quincy that i finally knew what lie had eaten away at her for all these years . on the wall opposite her , jaggedly carved into the wood paneling were two words : newline newline i m fine . for example , he often uses his dreams to seduce girls , so his dream will be of him having sex with a woman  the next day , when he wakes up , he knows that he will be with that woman that night , so when he does bump into her , he s able to say whatever he wants to her whatsoever , knowing it will conclude with their relations . newline newline sounds fun , but what happens when he dies or gets killed in his dream ? or what about the dreams where he poos himself furiously while he s bedding a woman ? the times he s on a crashing plane and suddenly realizes he was just watching the plane crash and his parents were on it instead ? newline newline pat on the back for the sex though , that sounds hot .we re crouching behind a corroded piece of sheet metal . any other time , and i would have been able to tell you exactly what metal it was , when it was made , and who made it . now , i know that it s the only thing keeping me alive . newline dakota has her rifle in hand . slade has his pistol . i ve got my knife . the rest are behind us , huddling and arming themselves with whatever weapons they can find . some of them are shivering , shaking in fear . newline it seems bizarre , almost comic , that we are so afraid of these creatures . we should nt be . they were humans , too , but now , they re depleted , driven insane . they re lesser beings than us , and yet they kill us . yet they have a bloodlust for us that seems to consume them entirely . newline we can hear the being stumbling around , picking through trash , searching for something , anything . newline it s getting closer to us , maybe a meter or two away . i look at dakota , and she nods , the bandanna tied over her nose and mouth shifting slightly . i glance back and slade , and he starts to count down newline three . two . one . newline we jump out and raise our weapons to the being . we re silent , no battle cries or screams of rage now . newline but it s not a monster , like we thought it was . newline it s isaac . newline he s got a gun , and he does nt even think before he fires it . it s too reflexive , and he s too startled . his bullet hits dakota , right in the middle of her biceps . she stumble a little and starts screaming . i m still stunned , completely bewildered , but even i know that she has to stop making that much noise . she ll attract more of them . newline i slap my hand over her mouth , and wrestle her to the ground . hopefully , she ll pass out from the pain . she ll have to . newline slade has forced isaac to his knees , and his pistol is to the back of isaac s neck . isaac is breathing heavily , his hands on the back of his head . his eyes are wide and staring at the wreckage on the ground . newline dakota has stopped struggling . she s out . i rip my overshirt off and begin to staunch the wound , wrapping the shirt tighter and tighter with each revolution around her arm . i tie it off and look at slade . newline  thats  newline  i do nt fucking care who it is . he s got ta go .  newline  that s my fucking best friend !  newline  i do nt care . he shot dakota , he s got ta die .  newline  she s gon na die , now , too !  i almost yell at him . i have to force myself to keep my voice down .  he ll be useful . he has a gun and he knows how to use it . he can help .  newline  dakota s not gon na die . she s gon na make it . this fucker s gon na die .  newline  i ll kill you ,  i say , and rush towards him , shoving my knife in his face .  do nt you fucking touch him . i ll kill you .  newline slade shakes his head sadly .  i m sorry , hunter . but he s got ta die .  newline before i can do anything else , he pulls the trigger of his gun . i feel isaac s blood splatter my leg and stomach . newline with a scream of rage , i dive forwards even farther and attempt to stick my knife in slade . he s expecting it , though , and he turns the gun on me . newline drives the barrel between my eyes newline cocks it . newline pulls the trigger a final time .i sat on my chair and looked out into the grassy field , thinking about jason . newline newline we had been together for decades , since we were in our early twenties . there was very little that we had nt done together : raised children , lost pets , moved across the country a dozen times . attended the weddings of both sets of parents , and then the funerals of three of them . our oldest daughter had just begun her courtship with a young man from the next town over . newline newline there s a lot you can do in fifty years . we d seen a large part of the world , and every state of our home country . attended lectures , dances , gallery openings . newline newline jason had had a long career as a professor , much in demand with various universities , which prompted some of our moves . but we had never liked to stay in one place for long , so every six or eight years  repaint the kitchen , clean the carpets , pack everything into the truck and drive somewhere new . we had lived in oakland , portland , atlanta , san francisco , boise , chicago . rural tennessee . vermont . montana . newline newline he had been published several times , technical works about advances in archaeological techniques . seventeen peerreviewed articles , four books . there were interviews and documentary segments . he had been quite famous before he retired . newline newline but seventy rolled around , inevitably , and he did retire . we moved across the country  again  to missouri , found a quiet town , bought a house on the river . i retired a year later , halfway  i still work as a substitute math and physics teacher at the local high school . newline newline we were both professors , though i was never as wellknown as jason . i was published a few times , but i taught because i loved to teach , not because i loved to push the boundaries of human knowledge . jason taught as an excuse to do archaeology . i did physics as an excuse to teach . we were wellmatched . newline newline we met in college , when i was a senior and jason was a sophomore . he got trashed at a party in my dorm , and i was the designated sober person for the evening , so i took care of him while he vomited . he came back to thank me and ask for my number the next day . our first real date was a month later , coffee just off of campus , nothing fancy . i started work on my master s while he finished undergrad , and by then we were fairly certain that we had found something worthwhile . newline newline i did nt mention it to my parents for a few years , they were traditionalists and would have liked to meet jason before we began dating . they did nt react too badly when they found out the truth , though  they liked jason immensely and were happy that i had found someone . my sister did nt think that he would prove worthy , in the end , but she backed off after the tenth year . newline newline we had children by then : annie was four and i was pregnant again . i was finishing my doctorate while jason took a few years off to stay with annie . i finished my degree right before daniel was born and we switched  jason went to get his doctorate and i stayed home . newline newline i never did any of the worldchanging things i thought i would do , but i was happy and our children did well , so i m not too disappointed . jason was a star in his field , changed the course of academic archaeology forever . his name will be remembered , which means that mine will as well , at least as his accomplished partner . newline newline we decided a few years back , before we moved to astoria , that we d get married after we retird . it was the traditional time to do it , after all . a full life , children moving out into the world , careers coming to a close . you move somewhere nice , put your feet up , throw a party . declare to the world that you had spent your lives together and did nt intend to stop now . jason had been looking forward to it for years , i knew . i did nt care as much as he did , but i knew that his father , who was nearly ninetyfive , would be disappointed if we did nt marry , and it made him happy , so i was willing . newline newline the sun was stronger here in missouri than it had been in astoria . more equatorial , i suppose , and much less rainy . the meadow was warm and close in the spring sun . i stretched out on my plastic lawn chair , eyes closed , hand on the smooth stone beside me . newline newline  what do you think , jason ?  i said aloud .  do you want to get married ?  newline newline i was met with the dense silence of spring mornings : rustles , chirps , distant water over rocks . a few minutes later , ready to go , i opened my eyes with a sigh . newline the chair beside me was empty . i leaned over and kissed the top of jason s headstone , and then i picked up the chairs and left , making my way out of the cemetary and back into the bright life of the town .ever since he  d retired zeus had taken to pottering about in his shed at the end of universe . newline it kept him busy and out of the way of the mrs. newline he liked to make things like two headed cows , frogs with extra legs and those weird unidentifiable sea monsters that wash up on beaches every now and again , just the mess with the humans and to annoy the new management . newline those damn upstart new gods taking his job . it just wasn  t the same anymore . newline back in his day all a god had to do was to blow his nose and the universe would convulse . time was when being a god actually meant something , back when you could start a good war , tear mountains asunder , send heroes on epic quests , and cavort with nubile young nymphs and be back at olympus in time for tea . newline nowadays it was all about none intervention and cost effectiveness . newline he rembered when odin , thoth , huitzilopochtli and himself had got really drunk and had hidden the atlantic ocean in thors helmet . you just couldn  t get away with that nowadays , not with hera breathing down the back of his neck all the time . newline odin was in a nursing home now , his time taken up with crossword puzzles and his love of irish linin . newline last he herd thoth was living in oxford masquerading as an old oxford don . newline he had nt seen the old gang in centuries . maybe he should give them a call . maybe but not today . newline he put the finishing touches to the winged cat he was working on in yorkshire and ambled back up the garden path to the house , hera would pissed if he was late to tea .why ? why do i get the distinct feeling i  ve been here before ? the professor is completely and utterly wrong . scipio didn  t die here  he died out in liternum , near the southern end of italy , far from the city he called home . in old age , the generalturnedtribune had come to despise rome , so much so that he ordered his body be buried far from his  ungrateful city  . i  ve read about this before , committed it to memory as befits an ancient history major . newline newline so why then do i remember the feel of a sword grip in my callused hands , the tears staining my cheeks as i watched the great commander die before my very eyes ? newline newline  mark cato ? mark cato !  are you quite done daydreaming yet ?  newline newline  h huh ?  newline newline the iron smell of blood fled my nostrils as , blinking , i realized that my handssoft things which had rarely even held a kitchen knife , let alone a swordwere clenched into fists in front of me , one in front of the other as if reenacting the grisly scene . unclenching one , i lifted disbelieving fingers to my cheeks , noting the coolness of my drying tears only in passing . as my fingers came away , memories rushed forth that i shouldn  t have possessed . unthinkingly , i spoke . newline newline  i  m sorry , but you  re wrong , dr. demeter . scipio africanus didn  t die here in his own homehe died abroad , intentionally , for he wanted no more of the city that had betrayed him in old age.  my hands began to shake slightly as even more impossible tearsand wordsspilled forth .  i i remember killing him with my own two hands . i remember the fist he raised , the words he said to me , but addressed to rome .   thankless country , thou shalt not even possess my bones.    newline newline though the words i spoke were english , it was ancient latin i heard in my head , in the aged but still imperious voice of the general himself : ingratae patriae tu ne quidem ossibus meis .  even in the end , scipio africanus had remained the consummate roman soldier : proudly devoted to his country as it had been , even if its current heads of state were not . but even here , the words made little sense . while i  d taken a couple latin classes before , the form of this statement was too archaic to have been covered in any of them . newline newline following my strange revelation , my classmates kept a decidedly large distance between me and themselves . i didn  t mind in the least . i  d thought that giving voice to the strange sensations i  d been experiencing ever since our europe trip began would make them go away . if anything , however , they intensified . it started in andalucia at the strait of gibraltar , worsened in seville , and came to a head in cannae , on the other side of the boot from liternum . actually , i  ve been assaulted ever since setting foot in italyassaulted by memories . at least , that  s what i  ve been calling them , since the images have a decidedly antiquated  past is past  feel to them , but i  ve never actually done or seen those things in my life . wield a sword ? threaten highranking politicians with it in court ? those were feats best kept in legends , or in video games . newline newline by the time we returned to our hostel late at night , i didn  t join my classmates in mobbing the bathroom for a shower . instead , i plunked myself down in front of my computer and pulled up the family tree i made in andalucia . from my own name and my parents  names , i knew my heritage lay in italy , but when i entered my family history into the database , all i got was nothing . i had no ancestors beyond those two , and they had no ancestors themselves . stunned , i  d shot an email over to the site admins , only to get a copout response that the database was incomplete and that i should check again at a later date . i knew it was a copout because i  d done this genealogy thing before , back in grade school , with the same results . no one cared back then since  family  to grade schoolers was parents and maybe a few aunts and uncles . but now , decades later , the problem took on a whole new significance . without family history , bombarded by memories not my own , i began to wonder if i  d been placed on this earth rather than created by the usual means . newline newline i almost didn  t want to sleep that night , for i  d learned through experience that these  memories  which began as flashbacks persisted into the night as beyondreal dreams . during previous nights , i  d seen sandaled feet , trudging horses , and a great cloud of bloodied dust obscuring my view of the city i called home .  home ? my home was in philadelphia , not in rome .  always , the smell of leather and clay and blood greeted my nose , a smell that filled me with mingled pride and loathing . i  d joined the army to cleanse the land of barbarians for my fatherland  yet here i was , marching away from it because some closeted tribune decided my general wasn  t worth anything to rome anymore . newline newline but this time when sleep took me , i was greeted not by shouting and steel , but by a great crystal dome , beyond which shone a light as blue as the untouched sky . yet some distance from me , the ground was obscured by shadow , even though above , i saw nothing . before i could take a step in that direction , a booming voice filled my head , timeless but somehow kind . newline newline  mnemosyne , my child i have waited a long time for your return.  newline newline i knew without asking that the speaker was uranus , god of the sky and father of the titans , whose arms and legs supported the east and west sides of the world before he lost the role to atlas . strange enough for a fallen god to be addressing me even in dreams , but even stranger newline newline  wasn  t mnemosyne female ?  newline newline my mind  s ears filled with an amused , if aggrieved , chuckle .  indeed she was . but after my falland in time , olympus  smnemosyne split her soul and cast it into the bodies of several romans , each of whom would retain the memories of their past lives . the fragment you possess was cast into the body of aurelius cicero , the forgotten right hand of scipio africanus of rome . more importantly , yours was the only one to remember lives of millennia past . newline newline you are the only one strong enough to take up the mantle of the god of memories . now , i beseech you return to olympus , and restore it to its former glory.  newline newline the vision faded , and i awoke to sunlight streaming through my window . though nothing about the scene around me had changedi was still in the hostel in rome , and my roommates were still sleeping as far away from me as possible following the liternum revelation , i felt as if the pieces of my life had never made more sense . newline newline my photographic memory . my love of history . my mysterious lack of  human  ancestors , and the strange visions i  d received over the past several weeks . newline newline and somewhere deep inside me , i knew where i was going next . itinerary be damned . newline newline            newline newline felt like writing something roman this time . i hope this is an enjoyable read i might want to explore this idea again sometime  who knows .he was looking at her again , smiling with his eyes . he started doing that a few days ago when she gave him a few compliments to lift up his morale . he was frustrated that he was not doing so good at basketball because of his height . and she just kinda snapped :  you are smart , not bad looking and you have a bloody motorcycle . it really does not matter if you are not good at basketball . you can not have them all , you know ?  newline newline newline he was shocked for a moment , and looking at her like nobody ever said that to him before . short time later , he started confiding in her . he started getting too close . she hated that . she knew what that might lead to . and indeed he was a great guy . there was only one problem . two problems actually . he was 6 years younger than her . she did not look her age and they had a lot in common , but still the age difference bothered her a lot . and it was not about society norms , or what their friends would say . it was about him , using her to become a man and then dumping her in order to prove his manhood to a younger woman . it happened before , with somebody else , and she almost killed herself after he left . and she was nt sure she could get used to this , meaning , living every moment with a man as it might be the last one because one day without any warning it will be the last one . newline newline newline the second problem was that , after the previous breakup she decided to focus on her carrier . and she had a full time and a part time job . and some health problems which needed weekly analysis and treatment . and she had a cat . and the cat needed attention too . she could not fit a relationship in her schedule . and she definitely did not need the insomnia caused by her missing him and wishing he would sleep by her side . and there was the younger colleague with blue eyes and big tits . she was cuddling up to him like a cat to its owner . men are weak you know , and younger girls are easier to impress . he might choose the easy way . newline newline newline how did she allowed this this to happen ? how did she allowed herself to fall in love with him ? he was a manchild who will not grow up until he will be 35 at least . and she wanted a partner which would be as smart and evolved professionally as she was . not this shy manchild with a passion for doves and motorcycles . yes , freaking doves . he is taking care of them and breeding them for contests . and she had a cat . this was destined to be a failure since before even beginning . so , rationally thinking , nothing was even started and you can not have an appetite for something you never tasted right ? but she was yearning for him , dreaming about him , missing him . and hating the younger colleague , although she was a really nice and troubled girl . and maybe she needed him more than she did . and maybe she could give him more attention and love than she could . newline newline so obviously , falling in love was not an option . and he knew nothing about what she felt , so there was no harm done . except to her . so she did the best she could . she made an appointment with a psychologist to learn how to control her feelings and making them go away . they quit ? what do you mean they quit ?  newline newline  your holiness , many of your officers did nt agree with your promotion of ardeus . they voiced their complaints and you did it anyway .  newline newline  i m jesus christ and they are nt just officers , they re my angels , they ca nt just quit ! newline newline  well christ  , just watch us !  newline newline and with that , gabriel slammed his halo on jesus  desk and flew out the door . he knew it was a risky plan to promote ardeus , but he had his reasons for doing so . bringing ardeus up was supposed to improve relations between heaven and hell , which would in turn make things a lot better for those living on earth . it was nt a bad plan , all things considered , but it backfired tremendously . almost all of the angels had left heaven , and things were going even worse down in hell . pestilence , war , famine , and death had free reign on earth in between . dumbfounded by the magnitude of his mistake , for the first time in millenia , jesus wept . could you look this way please ?  terry lifted his head and looked at the man in front of him . terry , still disoriented , squinted to get a better look . newline newline  what , what  s going on ?  mumbled terry . newline newline  just hold still for a bit please.  the man shined a light into terry  s left eye , causing terry to wince and shut his eyes . newline newline  please ,  comforted the man ,  try to keep your eyes open.  terry didn  t know who was talking to him , but he sounded very straightforward and direct . terry did not think twice about listening to his instructions . newline newline  who are you ?  slurred terry as he forced his eyes open , aggravating the pounding in his head . newline newline  my name is doctor fletcher ,  the doctor lowered the light , giving terry a moment of reprieve before examining his other eye .  how about you , can you tell me your name sir ?  newline newline  my name , yeah , um , it  s terry.  newline newline  okay , very good terry , and your last name ?  newline newline  dob , dobson ,  terry took a deep breath as a pain shiver streaked across his body . newline newline  do you know what day of the week it is ?  newline newline  oh , um , it  s monday , i think.  newline newline  good , and can you tell me what happened ?  asked the doctor has he lowered the light . newline newline  what happened ?  repeated terry as he lowered his head and rubbed his eyes .  jesus , i hit another car , didn  t i ?  newline newline  okay mr. dobson , that  s good.  as the doctor continued his exam , terry grew more and more aware of what he did . he remembered slamming into the other car . it was pulled over to the side of the road but terry did not notice it until the two cars became one . his was mind was elsewhere , distracted by what he was going to do later that day . newline newline  well mr. dobson , that  s it for now ,  said the doctor as he finished his examination .  we  ll know more after the xrays , but it looks like you just took a bump and should be okay . in any case , i am going to keep you here tonight.  newline newline  thank you doctor ,  replied terry ,  can i ask a question ?  newline newline  of course , what is it ?  newline newline  the other guy , is he okay ?  doctor fletcher paused for a moment , as though he was carefully choosing his words for an answer . newline newline  try and get some rest.  newline newline that night , terry wept , doing his best to make sure that nobody in the hospital could hear him . the guilt was overbearing .  you ruined enough lives terry ,  he said to himself over and over again . his wild thoughts kept him up all night . newline newline at around four in the morning , terry mustered the strength to climb out of bed . while being examined , he noticed that there was a lot of activity in a particular room , which he assumed was occupied by the victim of his recklessness . he snuck over to the room and walked in . newline newline terry  s initial reaction was that of pure dread . the man laid asleep on the bed with an assortment of machines and tubes hooked up to him . terry pulled over a stool and sat beside the man , which he recognized as the driver of the other car . the older man looked lifeless . terry  s eyes filled up with water again and continued to weep , much louder time repeating aloud ,  i  m so sorry , i  m so sorry.  newline newline  mr . dobson !  exclaimed a voice from the door ,  what are you doing ?  terry didn  t answer , but continued bawl .  you can  t be here.  terry recognized the voice and turned around to see doctor fletcher standing behind him . newline newline  i  m so sorry doctor , i should have been more careful !  newline newline  terry ,  doctor fletcher grabbed another stool and sat beside terry ,  it  s not what you think.  newline newline  not what i think !  exclaimed terry .  look what i did !  newline newline  listen , you didn  t do this ,  explained the doctor ,  his injuries from the crash where only a bit more serious than yours.  newline newline  but , but , why does he look like this ?  stuttered terry . doctor fletcher looked around and sighed . newline newline  i am not the one that told you this , but this fellow here had a heart attack , which probably why he pulled over to the side of the road.  newline newline  heart attack ?  newline newline  yeah ,  continued doctor fletcher ,  you see , had you not hit him when you did , who knows how long he would have gone unnoticed  he could have died.  newline newline for the first time in long time , terry felt something , a strange feeling  he felt good about himself . it was due to pure dumb luck , but something he did actually helped somebody . he couldn  t help but smile . newline newline doctor fletcher escorted terry back to bed , where terry slept for the rest of the night in peace . the next morning , he was discharged from the hospital . his first stop from the hospital was to the police inbound lot , where his wrecked car was kept . he opened the passenger door and reached into the glove box container . from within , he pulled out an envelope and a revolver . he tore the note up , removed the single bullet from the gun , and carried on with his day , and with is new life . newlinedear pat , newline there was a really loud , shattering bang right now . debris is raining all around me . i can hear the roar of a dozen engines , drowning your voice in my head . the sound of your laugh . the crinkles at the ends of your eyelids . pat , i can not begin to express my apologies for all the lost time , the lost anniversaries , for missing the little moments that tie our life together . i apologize for missing haley s first word . i apologize for every christmas card with just two faces on it , yours and haley s . newline words escape me right now , when i think about how much i miss your tight bear hugs . haley s toothless smile . i miss sitting on our front porch and playing scrabble . i miss the smell of our sheets . hell , i miss a bed . newline they re right about 200 meters away from me right now . newline our wedding song s playing in my head . the beats match with my heartbeat right now . do listen to it , as a reminder of all the good times we ve ever had , cause if you meet me right now , you may not recognize the person i have become , benumbed by war . you may not agree with what i m about to do . newline it must be dinner time there . i ask you to do one important thing for me remove the place setting by the corner , and put it in the back of the glass cabinet . feed haley , and tuck her in for the night . mommy s not coming home .jonathan sat in the corner of his room , the sound of silence ringing in his ears . he hated the arguing of the men and the awful scraps of food they left for him . it was nt enough . seven days after the sounds and screaming stopped , he realized that the only thing he hated more was the hallucinations that his mind created to fill the void . like a conditioned animal , he craved the single event that took place at precisely 7:00am every morning on the other side of his metal door . something alive , something real slid a cookie under the door to keep him nourished . newline newline the first cookie to slide under his door left a trail of blood in its path . from the crack underneath the door frame to the middle of the room , the streak dried . the next day , a similar cookie slid underneath the door , this time relatively clean . he hastily took a bite , savoring its taste after remembering the previous day s surprise . it was delicious . newline newline on the third day , jonathan waited with his eye pressed to the sliver of light emitting from the crack beneath the door . when the gift came , all light from the crack disappeared . in the darkness a massive form covered the doorway , blocking his visibility . jonathan recoiled . as he worked up the courage to open his eyes , the crushed remains of a cookie lay before him . he stared forward as if considering whether or not he would consume his one meal today . upon reaching out to touch it , blood began to flow from the dessert towards him . he greedily swallowed the treat and retreated to his corner . newline newline the fourth morning , jonathan awoke to the sound of footsteps coming from out in the hallway . he looked at the clock on his wall . 6:58am . placing his right eye to the crack and closing his left , he salivated as sound of footsteps drew closer and stopped before him . the clock struck 7:00 . newline newline ... newline newline the man looked down at the crack beneath the door where he could hear the thing breathing , casting droplets of condensation onto his boot . he carefully removed a thick slab of meat from a transparent bag and placed it beneath the door . the thick metal shook as it was devoured immediately . as he left , the man spoke into his watch . newline newline  day four since containment breach . three more have died from their injuries . they have become an additional food supply for our creation . only two things are certain . newline newline it still thinks it s a child , and eventually we are going to run out of ways to feed it .  gods have problems . minimum wage is one of them . the gender pay gap is another . but the biggest problem is the sewerage system . newline newline  why did nt any human ever worship the god of faeces and drains ? the landfills are beginning to stink now .  a voice echoed from all about . newline newline  what do you care ? you are nameless and formless . the stink would nt bother you , would it now ?  nut shouted in her shrill voice . newline newline  because i am everywhere . i see , hear and smell everything . every sense is amplified in omniscience . and it stinks worse than hell .  newline newline thoth tried to calm the situation down . he stood up and raised his hands . newline newline  listen , you guys , the problem is that we are not fully harnessing the resource at our disposal .  newline newline  you mean the mountains of landfill on the outskirts of the city that we ca nt dispose ?  minerva said . newline newline thoth ignored her .  look , we have a massive overcrowding problem here . we have a city of twenty million plus residents . but our capacities are stymied by our high egos and messiah complexes .  newline newline everyone fell silent . it was true . the city was being driven into ruins because the residents prefered to meddle in human affairs while ignoring the problems in their own backyard . newline newline  so what do you suggest ?  manjushri the boddhisattva asked . all eyes in the city council were on him now . newline newline  let me introduce you to my three new friends . they had died because no one worshipped them anymore but with the help of my friend osiris , the god of resurrection , i ve been able to bring them back .  newline newline  this is kawaya kami . the god of turning shit to fertilizer , and guarding people from falling into septic tanks .  newline newline kami waved .  i ve been gone for a long time , thinking humans did nt need me anymore . please pray to me while you go about your business .  newline newline  and this is cloacina . our lady of the toilets .  newline newline she stood up and waved .  please pray to me to ensure your drains and pipes are not clogged .  newline newline  and this one is crepitus . if you are constipated , he is the one you turn your prayers to . his blessings can even bring fragrance in your flatulence .  newline newline  that d be a relief .  edesia and ambrosia , goddesses of dining echoed in chorus . newline newline  so now , everyone . can we agree to stop meddling in human affairs and try to get our own shit in order ? the quality of life is getting pretty bad in here .  newline newline people nodded . newline newline  good , so i propose setting up a new municipal council to go further . sanguan and amanator , the gods of bureaucracy , will be our new overlords now .  newline newline nods of agreement flowed through the townhall . newline newline  our new motto is to make gods great again . no more caring about humans . no more globalism or earthism . we set our own house in order . no more about the 1  gods dominating everything . gods and goddesses , today , we seize the means of production and establish our paradise right here !  newline newline an omniscient voice grumped in disapproval , but it was drowned out by the cheers of agreement by the crowd . newline newlineanother win due to his extraordinary skill . newline newline mike licked the cheeto dust from his bulbous fingers , sniffing loudly as he waited for to be connected to a new game . suddenly , his screen flashed , changing to red and he narrowed his piggy eyes . spam ? a virus ? malware ? not with his top notch security software ! newline newline he leaned back in his chair , grunting with annoyance as black text started scrolling across the screen . at the same time , he heard a low hum emanating from what seemed to be his computer while mist started rapidly filling the room from an unknown source . newline newline what was this ? he started as he finally registered the sound and the odd mist curling around his legs . obviously no ordinary virus . he leaned forward on his chair , sweat beading on his forehead  quickly beginning to read . newline newline  you , michael james hutchinson , have been randomly chosen by us , your creators , to take on a new responsibility for mankind . you will be blessed with powers of the most extraordinary kind in order to make this world a better place . do you choose to accept this responsibility on behalf of  newline newline the computer finally accepted his input . mike stopped mashing the escape key as the sound , the screen and the mist inexplicably vanished and the hero select screen flashed up just in time . newline newline he breathed a sigh of relief . that was close , his team would have lost without him . mike smirked , took a swig of dew and settled down to win again . newlineas kids we had all watched the alien invasion movies , played the games and read the books . they were easy , the aliens come , we fight them and eventually we kill them . that s it . but after all real life was never like the movies , the games or the cartoons , we learned that . it s year 2078 , it has been 15 years since i first heard it on tv , a large object had fallen from the skies . it literally crashed on las vegas , wiped the whole city out . the media first guessed that it was a nuclear missile sent by the russians , luckily the military knew better so ww3 was postponed . when the dust , smoke and fire had subsided it was clear to everyone , even to uneducated folks , this was some type of construction and it was certainly not man made . newline newline i remember the scenes like it was yesterday , all the tvstations were there , sending live while the military ran around trying to figure something out . after a few hours a large ramplike thing fell down crushing a few of our soldiers and out came hundreds of creatures . they were about the size of a human but with 5 legs and a face like a cockroach . luckily no fight broke out , our boys were frozen of fear . but it quickly turned out better than expected , they were quite intelligent and had studied us from far away , even learned our language . one of them held up a peace of steel which had the word  peace  cut out for everyone to see . truly shocking . newline newline months later when the government had figured it all out , got their answers from our  visitors  , it was time for the public to get some information about it . they had cnn make a live broadcast with one of these things , and it told us everything . our  visitors  technology was based on nuclear fission , they had a major failure on their ship causing a meltdown . they were far away from home , actually they did nt even come from our universe and according to this thing it was impossible to fix anything on their ship because our universe didn  t have the material they need . it was something they called  reixidium  , it s the material they use to run their nuclear reactor . uran , plutonium and such were way to weak and unstable to be used in such a ship . newline newline first i thought this was great , these things obviously knew a lot about science since they had been traveling to other universes . they could probably teach us a lot . the government was thinking the same , because after the first year they started a project to integrate these things into society . new york was the place chosen , they got a block in the southern parts , but things went weird really quick . just like humans they reproduce , now after 15 years there are tens of thousands of them . so they have gotten more space , and because of it tensions has been building up , they are starting to take up to much space . they even live in the same neighborhoods as humans now . they stink , they behave weird and they never talk to humans , it s like they see us as their enemy . we humans feel threatened . on top of that they are far more intelligent than us , they take all the jobs , the universities are filled with these things . they are pushing us away , taking over our society from the inside . i have started to believe maybe their ship never did fail , maybe this has been an attack all the time . executed in a whole other fashion than what we saw in the movies and cartoons as kids . but i m to scared to spread the word , to scared to even think about it , i ve head rumors they are capable of hearing our thoughts , like telephaty . i do nt know how humanity will survive this , if we are lucky they will keep us as their slaves .this place is beautiful in the winter . newline newline my first deployment to afghanistan was back in 2023 . hardly a decade after the withdrawal of american combat units from the first afghan campaign  a conflict sparked by the public outcry for justice in the the aftermath of the world trade center attacks  ethnic uzbek and tajik separatists in the north of the country declared themselves for abdul rashid dostum , warlord of balkh province and one of the preeminent generals of the northern alliance that had fought against the taliban in the late 1990  s . newline newline unhappy with what he saw as a corrupt central government in kabul that ignored the grievances of the northern territories while blithely exploiting its staggering mineral riches , dostum called in his retainers and , seemingly overnight , consolidated an army of hardened fighters against the central government . their goal , dostum claimed , was to follow in the footsteps of the stillyoung islamic republic of kurdistan and establish a sovereign state that had direct control over its own mineral and petroleum reserves , as well as  of course  the profits from their sale . newline newline with the growing conflict threatening western mining interests in the region , the united states was forced to broker a ceasefire between kabul and the separatist forces led by dostum . newline newline i was part of the first wave of peacekeeping forces sent to the country as part of the terms of the ceasefire agreement . in return for dostum  s peaceful withdrawal from the capital , kabul agreed to administer the northern territories as a special autonomous region with its own government centered at mazaresharif , dostum  s seat of power . we were there to ensure the peaceful transition of power , and to oversee what was to become the new government  s first democratic elections . newline newline i was only a private then . when i wasn  t digging ditches or fixing radar and navigation equipment on our helicopters , i was on guard duty . newline newline i didn  t mind it much , really . you get a hell of a view from some of those guard towers . newline newline now , don  t get me wrong . the landscape there is nothing but boring , brown , and bland on its bad days , and god knows there are plenty of those . but on its good days , it  s gorgeous enough to take your breath away . newline newline i remember taking my post at one of the southfacing guard towers one morning early january . it had rained all day and night before , and by the time i rolled out of my cot and made my way to my station it was cold enough that the parts of the ground that weren  t muddying up my boots were covered in a thin , lightly crunching layer of frost . newline newline the darkness of early morning obscured everything but the distant lights of vehicles convoying their way back to base after long overnight patrols . but when my eyes finally adjusted to the slowly growing sunlight peaking over the foothills to the east , i was mesmerized by what the light of dawn revealed . newline newline the precipitation from the day before had transformed the dull , listless range of mountains to our south  barren of anything but driedbrown dust and craggy rocks  into magnificent snowcovered massifs towering over our sprawling encampment as if to swallow us whole . newline newline  this is what it must feel like to face a tsunami ,  i thought . newline newline the ground , which only yesterday had been painted with the same powderbrown dust that plagued the mountains , had sprouted into a thin but vibrant layer of green that spread far out in every direction until it reached the horizon or touched the base of the foothills . the short , straggly blades of grass defiantly pushing out of the frostbitten earth had appeared overnight , in the dead of winter , as if by magic . newline newline and it really was magic , every bit as much then as it is now . newline newline but this time , things are different . this time , even the magic of the afghan landscape can do nothing to assuage the cold , prying dread and suffocating fear of what is to come . there is nothing that can  not at this point  not since the first contact , and in the days that immediately followed , when  for the first time  we fully understand what it was going to cost us . newline newline this is a fitting place to make our stand . it is afghanistan , after all  deadly as it is beautiful . this is where conquerors , gods , and empires come to die . and by this time tomorrow , i may very well add my bones to this grave . newline newline  to be continued ... mr. rogers took a small gulp of water and cleared his throat . newline newline  i  m a speech writer . 40 years i  ve been doing it  he said , his voice being a dead giveaway that he began smoking long before he entered his line of work . newline newline  it  s interesting to finally meet the uhm great man behind the great men !  said the interviewer  a barely twenty year old girl innocently unaware of the emotions she could induce in the opposite sex . sporting a slightly laundered red and white polkadot dress . newline newline the two second silence that followed gave her the hint flattery doesn  t move the man . she pressed her lips together , turned her head down for a split second then continued   aand who did you write for ?  newline newline rogers turned his gaze to the side as if he was disappointed the question was asked . returning his eyes to the interviewer  s , he said slowly  for movie makers , for the political folk  , stopped , flippantly bended his wrist and added  and the charities  . the interview wasn  t going well for amy . newline newline so she decided to push in a different direction .  what motivated you to write speeches for 40 years ? you could  ve been writing books or uh sales letters  . newline newline  huh , it must have been the impact i can make  mr rogers responded .  driving sales is what keeps this country going and i respect the folk that do that . thing is , i don  t believe you can write a book or a sales pitch that helps people do good.  newline newline though rogers didn  t speak much , his skill spoke for him . rumor was , the paint in his office started to crumble from the walls multiple times throughout his career due to the incessant clacking of his writing machine . newline some suspect rogers carried the us public through wwii  although he  d never reveal who his clients were , rogers was seldom seen with franklin roosevelt and harry truman . newline newline newline   newline sigh i m bad at thismy father was a prime example of how a man should stand up for himself . an example of what happens when you let people push your around . of how to be weak . after he died i promised myself that i would not stand on the sidelines while someone destroys my hard work . i was going to fight with tooth and nail for what is mine . newline newline when i first became aware of ray bulker i thought of him as nothing but an buffoon with a mouth too big and pickets too deep . a big shot in the economy that strangled enough money out of people to claw his way to an estimated net worth of 2.2 billion dollars . in a way , i thought it was quite impressive . he found a way to continuously profit off of poor peasants to make it into politics as the head of the republicans . newline newline what made him even more interesting was that he did nt need sponsorships . he could nt be swayed by the prospects of other businesses , could nt be bought by money because he already had it . he had no ties to anyone but himself , no dependencies , no true motive but to himself . he was , and still is a wild card , something i do nt want in this careful house i m building . newline newline when he started shouting obscenities about hispanics , asians and women on television , i figured the man was done for . career suicide in its finest . his collegues were dumbstruck and wanted him gone . but his ratings increased . he continued his rampancy on television , opening his mouth to let his shit flow out of his mouth in a way his behind could not possibly keep up with , even after a night at taco bell . newline newline i once had a discussion with him on some bills i wanted to push through congress , and he behaved as i thought he would at first . a big shot who felt like he was always right . a spoilt brat who should have been hit by his father more often to teach him some manners . when i confronted him about his behavior he did nothing but look me straight in the eyes , and smirk . newline he did nt respect me . he did nt fear me . he had nothing but contempt for me and everyone around him . and that s when i knew . he was going to run for president , not because he wanted to be president . he wanted to show america what it had become . he wanted to show the world how broken our system truly was , show the world the true face of our political system before destroying it and building something new from the ground . he was going to undo everything i have worked towards achieving , and i ll be damned if i was going to let him get away with it . i will not stand by the sidelines and watch it happen . i am not my father . newline newline newline newline newline theresa , you have to do this .  newline newline i wanted to reach out and smack the pleading look off of his face .  nobody has to do this , dante ! we could all just  newline newline  just what , theresa ? ! just leave , just take off and hide ? go back to normal society ? you and i both know that they would nt last a month !  even without turning around to look at him , i could feel the intensity of his gaze on me . newline newline  it s different now , there s enough highlevel soldiers and police to keep order .  i waved a hand towards the television , almost the sole source of light in the dark bedroom .  they ve been talking for weeks now about how the killing s been brought down . the death penalty s been reinstated for all murders , state employees have a mandatory retirement level , schools and daycares are getting emergency fortifications built around them ...  newline newline dante sniffed dismissively .  yeah , sure , but they leave out how that s only happening in the places they can actually control . what happened to all the exmilitary who just skipped out ? the farmers who slaughtered every animal they had before most of the rest of us knew what was happening ? they are nt talking about them anymore , because they ve set themselves up as warlords all over the map ! for god s sake , there s a planned parenthood farm 50 miles from here , and you know what they d do with our women ! theresa , please ...  newline newline i could hear the panic in his voice  it was controlled , but it had been creeping in more and more lately . he hated when i talked like this . i understood why , but he d never understand my perspective . i d take any option , any alternative ... if it would guarantee their safety . and though i hated him for it , dante was right . it still was nt safe enough out there . newline newline  all right ... all right .  dante exhaled a huge sigh of relief , though it cut short quickly as his own guilt caught up to him . clutching my hand tightly , he started to walk me towards the door . as we walked through the apartment , i inhaled the scent of the fresh fruit lying in a bowl in the kitchen . the blend of sweet and citrus aromas always calmed me down somewhat . we stepped out into the hall , and i stared down the flight of stairs . i could already hear the murmuring  the people were already waiting .  how many ?  newline newline  just one . but there s about a dozen waiting for you after that .  newline newline i took the first step onto the stairs , and instantly heard the tone of the crowd change , as it always did . the murmuring became more hushed , an air of anticipation hitting me before i could even see them . as i finally reached the ground , i looked out onto a room full of hopeful faces . they slowly parted as dante led me forward , but their eyes , their stares never wavered . newline newline at the center of the room was the table . it was an old , mahogany dinner table , and rather out of place in the former gym despite the fact that most of the equipment now rested against the walls . the table rattled  as the young man held down on it jerked against his captors . he did nt know me , but he could read the crowd . he knew what was coming . newline newline dante squeezed my hand as i drifted away from him , towards the prisoner s head . it was the little details that always caught me in these moments  the slight red line on the prisoner s chin , probably where he d caught himself shaving this morning . his hands were rough , but his nails were trimmed and clean . there was a tattoo on his shoulder , just a hint of flame and blood visible before vanishing under the shirt . i looked down at him , and my hand gently brushed against his cheek as i went for his gag . sometimes it helped . as i tugged it free , i looked at the four people surrounding the table , each holding a limb . as always , they were our lowest level  the ones who would benefit most . i d tried to share it amongst more in the beginning , but it never worked beyond the four . newline newline  you fucking bitch ! they ll come for me ! they ll come for me and they ll kill you ! they ll make you watch as they slaughter every last one of them , and then they ll kill you !  newline newline the words rang out in the otherwise silent room . i stretched out a hand , not needing to look to know that it would be met with the knife . the metal of the handle was still cool to the touch , and my fingers wrapped around the decorative hilt . leaning down , my head next to his , i gripped his hair firmly and pulled it away  a lesson i d learned rather painfully after nearly having an ear bitten off by a more violent prisoner . i murmured softly into his ear . newline newline  i wish they would . but you and i both know ... they d never kill me . i know it means nothing to you , but ... i m sorry .  newline newline the first spray of blood from his throat takes me back , as it always does . it s the rush of the experience starting to flow into me  it feels so similar to that drunken stupor i d been in , a year and a half ago . i can feel myself staggering out of that bar , the snowy slush parting underneath my feet . the temperature of the air drops around me , and i feel the rumble of the ignition as the car comes to life . i used to fight it  i tried so many times to stop myself , to throw the key away , to shove dante out of the car , to scream a warning . but it s the past  and not even the most powerful of us can change that . so now , i watch , as i always do , the swirling snow through the dark window , tiny pinpoints of white that are gradually eclipsed by two larger , hazy suns , until their light smashes through us . newline newline suddenly , the world is no longer dim and distant . i can feel every snowflake landing on my skin , the glass shards digging into my back , the wet , foul slush of the road oozing around my body . i can hear dante s screams , the raspy , gurgling screams of someone who can barely breathe . i can see the blood seeping out of his body and mixing with the grey slush . and i can see the burst of golden light illuminating the darkness , rushing outwards from my body . the knowledge burns in my mind , seeming as simple and natural as breathing now . it drives me , pushing me to crawl forward , towards the agony lying before me . i reach out a hand to my broken , terrified friend , and suddenly his screams stop , taken away by a gentle whirl of golden energy . as the pure light streams from me , i look over dante , at the remains of the car thrown off the overpass . the lifeless stares of the family below stare up at me , their stares no different from the one accusing me now , hanging limply from the table . newline newline i push myself up slowly , dante taking the knife from me as he always does . the others have fallen back into the crowd , their leveling already completed . mine still burns , the radiance bathing the crowd , illuminating the converted gym . distantly , i see the entrance , a single door open wide , but dante s hands are guiding me away already . he gently leads me towards the the others waiting for my touch , the sick and wounded , knowing that bringing them comfort and peace is the only thing that grants me any measure for myself . he s been many things for me since that night  my partner , my provider , my prophet . above all , though , he has been my protector , keeping me safe , even from myself . newline newline the world has changed , but one axiom remains constant  tanks love their healers .there was nt anything she hated more than being honest with herself , despite what the therapist told her . she suffered from depression for most of her life , and she fought back with a hearty ,  fuck you ! you ca nt tell me what to do !  if anyone pointed out that trying to intimidate chemical imbalances with loud voices and rude gestures , they were ignored . newline newline she loved her child deeply . so deeply that she had yet to find the event horizon of that love . hopefully , in her last moments , she did . she also loved her immediate family , and husband , but they were not the tiny , chaotic tornado of sunshine rampaging through the house like a cheerful ghengis khan . newline newline she loved many men , but fell out of love with all of them . it was never them , it was always her . she should have stuck with cats . newline newline aayin  19xx20xx  newline newline i went back to the stars . i ll be waiting for you . newlinei wake up first , because i can hear the footsteps of the earlymorning people outside the apartment door . when i was a puppy , i used to wake up when it got light out , but now i only have the sound to guide me . i forget what the sun is like . newline newline i nudge my human with my long blackandtan snout . she does nt like to get up early , but she hates it when she s late for things . newline newline  okay , okay sasha , i get the message ,  she mumbles . she trips to the kitchen to make her drink . i do nt know why she s so tired before it , but when she drops the strongsmelling brown packet , i pick it up for her again . she strokes my cheek . good dog . after she s had her drink , she pets me , then shooes me out of the bathroom . she smells clean then , and that s how i know she s ready . it s time to go ! i bring her my leash , and she laughs .

did nt even have a queen to feed ! perhaps she was already dead , and that is why they barely put up a fight . these creatures make no sense . newline newline no , this one was clever . he made me hear the voice of the queen . no , not her voice , but one very like hers . he could speak her tones , but not her language . i had to go find out what was going on , i literally had no choice but to fly toward the noise and understand it . but there was no queen . just that box . that obscene square with circles , that spoke blashphemy in the voice of her . and by the time i began to understand , i was bound , and my wings were shredded . it made me think about the strange faces and noises they made when we damaged their parts . as if their arms and legs were their queen  its as if they felt

this queenvoice box . no , they would have used it already . newline newline they ll die , like me . only without my joy , the joy of knowing my queen had a new nest , on this warm , wet rock fairly

suffer . they could not accept him as he truly was , nor could they accept what he was molded into . though there are those that call him friend , they are lost in a sea of hatred where even he can not tread . though there are those that call him family , it is they who crowned an unworthy king before even being born and he believed them . birthed to a star gleaming above superstitious fools and welcomed in a manger to a world not ready for his kind . before even his birth , they whispered god . even as he bleeds and dies , they whisper god . wise for his age and wise for his upbringing , he

around 9pm last night the troubles began as downtown turned into a war zone . it is believed by fox news that a team of almost 10 men , all dressed identically , came onto the scene and began opening fire on various places of business . the owners of the establishments tried to negotiate peacefully but were met with a hail of gunfire and were forced to defend their lives . newline newline the battle then raged across the city , systematically taking out the homes of the most generous and responsible men fox has ever had the pleasure of knowing . newline newline at every location the men planted great amounts of drugs , weapons and money in a pathetic attempt to frame the men . the police and yours truly believe the men are unconnected to the contraband . newline newline as of yet there is no id on any of the suspects , but as only one suspicious car was seen heading away from town , a giant manhunt is underway looking for the rest of the team . it is widely thought that this

proceed to tour the shelter , while i try to calm myself and catch my breath . just when i feel like i have collected myself  bang . newline newline  wow  they really take the sales experience seriously here ,  sarah exclaims . newline newline i too think to myself that this must be an elaborate sales tactic of bob s bomb shelters , but then i turn to look at the salesman . his face is one that i ve seen before . it s the same face as my former colleagues when a large portion of the mine that we worked in collapsed and left us stranded underground for two weeks . it s the face of absolute fear in an uncertain and terrifying future . newline newline  what the hell just happened , this is nt fake is it ?  newline newline  the hatch and walls have the best soundproofing money can

newline newline  everything looks fine to me  the sky is as blue as ever !  she says joyfully . newline newline we all breath a collective sigh of relief and exit the shelter . everything on the outside looks fine , but none of us can discern where the noise came from . newline newline  i ve had enough excitement for one day , we re going home to watch the game.  newline newline sarah and karen agree and we get into the car . after about two minutes of driving , we notice that there is a stalled car in the middle of the highway . proceeding slowly , i drive around it , noticing that there is no one in the car or around it . it did nt take long before we pulled up to another eight cars , each of which seem abandoned in the same fashion . i pull the car over to the side of the road in an effort to make some sense of this . newline newline  sarah , karen , could you please check your phones to see if we can find out if anything s happened ?  newline newline we soon realize that none of our phones have service . newline newline  perhaps there s something on the radio ,  karen says . newline newline after scanning for stations , the only available station is w97.5fm  country

 the following message is transmitted at the request of the federal government of the united states . there has been an unknown biological attack on the united states . current estimates indicate that the 97  of the population has been eliminated by this attack . we are urging any survivors to go immediately to the closest government shelter.  newline newline after listening to the entire message in horror , we realize that the closest identified shelter in the alert is nearly 100 miles away . after about an hour of trying to grasp the gravity of the situation , sarah and karen make their respective positions clear . newline newline  we should go back to bob s bomb shelter in case there s another attack . we ll be safe there ,  sarah insists . newline newline  the government shelter is only a 100km mom , we should go there instead ,  karen says . newline newline we debate where to go for some time , but karen and i ultimately accept sarah s plan . we arrive at bob s and quickly notice that the salesman is frantically moving metal boxes into the  extreme lux  bomb shelter model . newline newline  hey bob ! can we talk for a minute ,  sarah shouts . newline newline this was the first time that i realized that the salesman is the  bob  in  bob s bomb shelters  . bob proceeds to ignore sarah s calls and continues to stock up the shelter . as we get closer , bob quickly runs into his single trailer office which is on the lot . after a few seconds , bob comes out with a rifle aimed towards us and cocks it . newline newline  you need to leave right now . there s no

surrounded me . to my left a well polished shield hung on the wall , to my right there was a leather quiver filled with silver tipped arrows . i continued down the ancient corridor , passing many weapons . i remember every last one of them  there was a spear as long as i was tall , a hammer that looked too heavy to be held up by the earth itself . there was a pair of identical daggers , their ancient blades emitting a faint black aura , and there was a scythe with a silver blade that bore the inscription  my enemies the gods may reap , i merely carry their scythe  . newline newline these items were the tools of the ancient chosen warriors , hidden away in the legendary hall of chosen warriors . every step i took down the corridor meant giving up the chance to use the weapons i passed , for i must press forward if i hoped to gain my own legendary item . newline newline eventually i reached the end of the hall and knew which one would lend me its power . on the back wall of the corridor , there were no weapons hanging  instead there lay a sword in a pedestal directly in front of the wall . i recognized the sword instantly , it was my sword  i had forged it with help from my closest friend , who was a skilled blacksmith . how could it be here ! ? the instant i thought this , a mysterious voice came from my blade .  a warrior does nt come here to find a new blade , instead they come here to realize that they already have their legendary weapon .  without hesitation , i picked up my blade and was comforted by the familiar weight in my hand . with my sword in hand , i turned and left the corridor , ready to take on the darkness that i must face .my quiver weighing down my back , sweat running down my face , i loaded the crossbow . one shot . that was it . one shot

into my wristpad , drinking away my earnings today .  praise be to altman ,  the alien said as he strode off . yeah , just what we need , another crazy willing to off himself at someone s command .

first round , gagging and spitting up the contents . the barkeep chuckled , i scowled at the son of a bitch , before i could say something about my tainted drink . several bald humans burst in the bar . making a scene as the bald men met up with their comrades in the corner . sporting the scorpion insignia , bald heads , and trench coats .  to the brotherhood of nod !  they all bellowed . the automaton approached to take the new drink orders , its a.i . unaware of them eyeing the imperial soldiers dressed in battle dress green with their space marine brethren across the hall . newline newline anyhow , the berulian quietly poured me a drink as he profiled the new customers with his lizard like eyes , then scoffing at me , his disdain for humans apparent . finally a whiskey without the fucking sulfur like i ordered . i lit my illegal tobacco , images of my deranged jedi fanatic patients ran through my mind . the freaks shipped in from the civil war just a few par secs away .

could be as bad as asking too late . nevertheless , he gets his books for his next class and approaches . the courtship has begun . newline the body language between the two humans can be very telling . as he approaches , jason broadens his shoulders and opens up his chest to project confidence , strength , and masculinity . natalie initially shies away , focusing on her locker , but eventually , she can not feign her ignorance of the approach , due to the vocal communication coming from jason . newline from an observer s perspective , the conversation is quick . but to the two humans , is

and with difficulty , tries to hide his erection behind his books . the two separate . the courtship has concluded . newlinecolorful balloons , streamers and glittering decorations all vied for my attention , glaring and out of place in this new big room . the walls were white , clean not like the old place . the colors don  t hide how empty it is , and bright . newline newline the table is pretty , dark brown and cool to the touch , like the floors , fun to run my fingers over smooth . she makes a face when i pretend it  s a dark cave . we eat food at the table , it is nt for playing , they did nt care before . the last place made my nose burn , and there was always the fear . here it smelled like clean laundry all the time . but i don  t like the rules . newline the grown ups are nice , but they always tell me i  m wrong . i can  t take naps when i want , they don  t let me play a lot and the food is ikky but that  s ok because my tummy is always full now . newline newline she is nice , and he is gentle when i  m doing right . no one ever yells and when i cry they pick me up . they call me aiden and it sounds good , i like aiden . in the other place they said brat and him . never aiden and i didn  t know when they meant me or something else . when strangers come i don  t need to hide either , they even bring other ones over , brendan is my favorite , he has the green power rangers and can reach much higher than me to make the tallest block towers , but he  s being held by his mommy beside a giant castle of colored boxes . i want to play inside them but she picked me up when i tried to climb them . one of the boys they call  doctor  is here , he  s tall and has a shiny metal thing over his eye  s , normally when they say doctor i need to hide , i don  t like those big white people or the blue ones who poke me with cold hands or stick things in my arm that hurt even if they do give me suckers . newline newline she grinds the medicines up and puts them in

sweetie . welcome to your home aiden , blow out your candles  she said . i looked at the candles , the glowy things , but there are two . newline newline  maka swish  brendan said from his mothers

college students was about to unfold .  not that it matters where your from adam , but where were you born ?  jesus asked him while they were both settling into their dorms .  compton  adam replied proudly ,  i was raised in the hood but i knew there was more out in the world for me then staying the projects all of my , i want be a positive change in this god forsaken place .  newline newline  you seem like you have what it takes to make it ,  jesus replied ,  tell me have you ever noticed that you have a magnetic personality like girls , animals and people get along with you and you usually have your way with themever notice that before ?  jesus asked in a probing tone of voice .  i just brush them off my shoulder bro ,  adam did not know what jesus was getting at . maybe he thought jesus was gay and was hitting on him . newline newline  it s not coincidence adam , you give off a vibrant blue with red and yellow undertones , its very stimulating to others yet soothing , i bet you did nt notice that daisy down the hall was checking you out because i saw her walls come down while you walked by her .  newline newline  you see adam , all living creatures on this earth have a electromagnetic field around them , this why you can tell if the hobo across the 711 is constantly on crackhis energy field is destroyed thus killing himself . you can see it on his face ca nt you adam ?  jesus noticed adam was growing more interest as adam explained further .  so you saying that i radiate attractiveness  adam arrogantly asked .  more than that adam , you radiate life . for the longest time , the idea of being the last walking human on earth was appealing to him . imagine , an entire planet for no one but you . he would daydream about the day it would happen . he always had the slight suspicion that he would be the endling . he was the youngest ! out of the four , he had the most skills to survive ! of course , he thought that reproduction would be a good idea , and it almost worked out . he and jenna were the only ones that could try . the loss of a child was too much for her and she was gone by the night . newline newline the other two simply went mad . anita went first with a bullet to the brain . it was nt planned . it was nt beautiful . they were walking into the run down building they had turned into a farm . she had nt said anything that entire day and it was almost noon . tyrone told him not to worry . anita was just mourning , even though it had been months since jenna . but still , he worried , as a friend does and should . newline newline  i ca nt do this anymore ,  she said . the two men barely had time to turn around and see the tired woman with a pistol to her head . they agreed for it to only be for emergencies . anita s ending was nt beautiful . it was nt planned . jerome quit three days later . newline newline jerome s ending was subtle and thought out  at least the part that q saw . jerome shook q s hand and said he was done . he found a letter from anita , saying they should follow because  whatever s out there for the dead must be a hell of a lot better than what s here for the living . be smart . the world s dead . there s got ta be another .  jerome did nt expect anything from q other than  goodbye  , because q was never one for tears and  i love you  and  you made me a better person  . newline newline it was nt as easy as it could have been . q thought about anita s words and in his mind , he was sold . he stood at the edge of buildings longer than he should have . he searched for books on tying rope . after meals , he would stare at the blade and it would almost seem ... right . until the feeling of anita s words wore off and he could hardly remember them . newline newline he had to try a bit too hard to suppress how content he was with being alone . if god was still listening to him , he wanted to be sure that he was nt evil , just relieved , for his worry was then only for one . and for a while , the content feeling stayed with him . the  while  was nt more than a moment , because he realized that with being alone , came being alone , and he did nt feel it or think about it , until it was too late . he was alone and he had welcomed the idea . newline newline in the day , he would walk through his dead city until he had a map drawn and memorized . on his back was everything he needed , from basic food to sleeping gear . he tried to have a pet , but each time would end horribly . either an accidental death would occur or the only choice he had was to put the animal down . each time disgusted him and it came to the point where loneliness was better than temporary companionship of something that could be food . newline newline he was unhappy and alone . he was alone and unhappy . being the endling was nt what he wanted anymore , but suicide was nt going to be his way out . he left the city and took as much supplies as he could carry . he headed east with the intention to walk until he no longer could he filled his days with exploration and as much happiness as he could muster from the natural surroundings he had been given . that became his life , and he was in a place of tranquility until the day his eyes closed and he was taken as easy newline prey .it had seemed so simple then , who would nt want to live forever ? none of us had believed the stories . besides , there was so much in the world to see , far too much to get to in one lifetime . newline newline who could have known i d spend the bulk of those added years hunting down the others that had been in there that fateful night . newline newline at first it had been everything we d dreamed of ... summers on the riviera , winters on some remote island , whiling away the days with wine , women , and each other . money ceased to be an obstacle , so we lived like kings who would never die , because that s what we were really . newline newline that went on for a few years , and it almost would have been worth it , just for the memories . at my bleakest points , at the lonely 3 am of the soul that it seems i find myself more and more often , i try to latch onto those memories of laughter and warmth , but that does make it harder when i eventually catch one of the others and see what they ve become . newline newline you see , the thing about immortality is that even if it preserves your body , it does nt stop the wearing down of your soul . newline newline it started with things no one could be blamed for , really . our friends and family passed on one by one , until we were the only ones left , adrift in a world of strangers . we became detached from the world around us , and eventually , from humanity and all it entails . wine and women no longer passed muster , when your only concern has been living the sweet life for one hundred years , you eventually have to devise more and more innovative ways to try to spark any kind of interest or reaction . newline newline for some of us this started as mostly victimless pranks , more about the elaborateness or intricacy of what we were trying to pull off . some of us tended in a darker direction , and that s where their inner demons were laid bare . were these things always there , just lurking under the surface for want of time and opportunity , or had something fundamentally changed within us , and it was only a matter of time before we all became the thing which we feared most , an unrecognizable monster ? newline newline walters was the first ... a string of missing persons reports in whatever city he happened to be in , until eventually the rest of us confronted him about it as we sat on the balcony of the monumental palazzo he d bought in venice . newline newline he lounged with a goblet of wine in hand , appearing wholly unconcerned with the accusation we brought before him newline newline  what does it matter , they ll be gone in the blink of an eye anyway , their light extinguished before they ve made any real impression ... providing me with some fleeting entertainment is probably the most they can ever hope to achieve  he smirked , quaffing the rest of his wine and pouring himself another . newline newline his affected lack of concern was just an act , because when we went back together the next night equipped with weapons to put an end to him , he had disappeared , gone completely dark . newline newline it took three years , but we finally tracked him down in a remote tower in the romanian wilderness and he d become ... unrecognizable . he was raving and we saw things there that are burned into my brain that make me wish we d never drank from that damned fountain so many decades ago . newline newline i d thought that would be the end of a long nightmare and deep feelings of guilt that we d caused so much suffering for the families of the victims . we celebrated together that night as if we d saved the world . but it was nt too last . newline newline it was only a short time after that martin fell into a similar pattern , and so on down the line until there are only two of us left , the rest vanquished in one way or another to end their respective reigns of terror . newline newline now i am on my way across the atlantic to america to track down james , the only other one remaining . so far i have nt fallen prey to the same depravations as the others , but i know it s just a matter of time now . if i m able to defeat him i will end my own life , but before you think about holding me in any sympathetic light , dear reader , know that it s mostly a selfish act at this point . i ve seen too many horrific things over these years to want to continue in this realm , and i m ready for whatever judgement awaits me in the next . newline newline i write this that you may understand , perhaps , that it did not start out this way , and we never intended it too . but more importantly , if i should fail in my quest , it falls to the finder of this missive to finish the job . otherwise he will continue on , unchecked forever , and who knows how many will meet their inglorious end at his hands .crimson red , powder blue , sunset orange , baby blue , cotton candy pink , these things must correspond to every shade in our visible range . it s been a month now , and these contacts are ... amazing . they pick up my emotions so readily , sometimes even before i do . i love them , but as they change colour , sometimes i wish i could watch the transition , i can always feel it , but i never seem to get to the mirror , or my phones camera out quick enough . i m not the only test subject , but according to them , my results have been unique , my contacts are reacting strangely . sometimes they ll be normal , other times one of the contacts will be a strikingly different colour than the other . once they even went full out glitch , and half of one contact was pink , signifying love , and the other half way a deep royal purple , meaning amazement . the other ? it was pure white , meaning hope . in what ? i do nt know , but seeing my sister talk for the first time after being deaf her whole life ? that moment , when i was frozen in time for a minute , was the best , and since then , hope been given to me in the best way possible , my sister . newline  newline sorry if it s kinda directionless , but i did nt really know what to write about and rambled a bit : hi , my name is deckerd . it  s an odd name , i know . my parents weren  t particularly kind in that matter . newline newline or any matter really . newline newline my name is deckerd and i  m a thief . i didn  t want to be a thief , but , as they say , sometimes your profession chooses you . i was always particularly adept at it . like my name , i attribute this fact to my parents . newline newline my father was apt to go on drunken binders seven to eight nights a week . he  d be more sloshed than a sailor on leave , had a worse mouth than a prostitute  s parrot and had a temper that would make a bear falter . moving silently around the house was not just a preference , it was an rule  under penalty of ass kicking . and my father , ever the debauched pain the ass , would find time and tool to enforce such punishments . newline newline and my mother was a whore . literally . i wouldn  t insult her , or the profession , really , i find it  s a wonderful job . they  re doing god  s work . or wait . well , you know what i mean . she was a nice whore for the most part , and a pretty good one according to her bulging wallet . she wasn  t particularly mindful of her money . or perhaps she was and simply said nothing when a talent would go missing here or a dragon there . newline newline but really , my thievery didn  t change from hobby to profession until one of the trinkets spoke to me . yes , spoke to me . not the godly or demonic kind of speaking , which usually involves a second party entity possessing your soul . the things spoke to me . newline newline i don  t share this with anyone . the only reason i  m telling you now is because i know you won  t be able to repeat the story . this kind of thing would put me in a jacket at the loony bin . you seem like a pretty solidthing so i thought i  d share with you , since you were kind of enough to share with me . newline newline you aren  t the first thing that wanted to be stolen . in fact , so many of youthingsi really need to come up with a name of you allwant to be taken , i only have time to steal those that speak to me , those that want to leave . don  t worry , you  ll be among other belongings that wanted to be stolen . i  m sure a someone as lofty as yourself will have no issues making friends : it  s not everyday they get to see the guard  s seal ring in their presence . newline newline i  d like to see that captain make any decisions now , or explain it to the king without losing his head . ha ! what a glorious revolution this will turn out to be . i wonder what kind of orders we  ll be able to mockup with a little bit of wax and your judicial stature ? newline newline hush now , someone is coming around the corner . it won  t look good if they see me talking to a ring , even one of your political sway . newlinethorn sat atop his new bed  if the roughly mansized wooden crate could be called such a generous word  trying desperately to ignore the stench of the previous owner s corpse rotting from within it . newline newline riverside prison was a fine place , as far as prisons went . the guards tended to leave inmates alone and that was a good thing for some , a bad thing for others . for thorn , it was a great thing . killing rex was done more for the statement that the action would make than for the bed . still , as fearful eyes watched him stuff rex s fresh corpse into the crate and force the lid closed , thorn felt he needed to do something memorable . newline newline so he climbed atop the bed and slept . newline newline in riverside , sleep was the enemy . an inmate had to make allies in the prison , had to , lest he get stabbed in his dreams . going to sleep in front of every man in the cell was a statement bolder then killing rex . i m not scared of you . newline newline truthfully , thorn had a nightmare after that . he d killed so often before , but rex s last moments stuck with him . he went over it again and again in his sleep . newline newline  so  , the large man sounded resigned , not at all as if a knife were in his gut .  it ends here , after all this time .  newline newline he looked young , possibly 20 years or so , before thorn stuck him . the man had managed to create a name for himself in the short time he was at riverside . in killing him , thorn essentially took all of that power and bestowed it upon himself . years of work taken in one day . newline newline thorn let out a deep breath as he drummed the heels of his feet on the crate . this was who he was . a parasite . a leech . newline newline he reached into the pocket on his cloth pants and grabbed the brass key within it . killing rex was done for the statement , yes , but also because he had a key . newline newline thorn forced a smile on his face , aware that some of the inmates were looking at him . he was a parasite . it was nt a matter of shame to him anymore . it was just who he was . newline newline thorn held the key tightly in his left hand and waited for nightfall . it was nt for the cell door . thorn had tried unlocking it soon after he woke . it could only be for the outer door . the ceiling had small holes for fresh air to come in and the last traces of daylight could be seen through them . soon , the guards would come for dinner . he d kill them . he d go to the outer door . he d use rex s key . it has to work . newline newline it was his compassion that ultimately let thorn be captured by the guard . newline newline he would nt make the same mistake twice .the mountains have worn the tides of time better than any creature made of flesh . it s why we , the many men and women of the mesmer s guild , hold the jagged formations in holy regard . i jumped onto a rocky outcrop , my seeingdeer leash bound and close behind . ahead , the mighty peak of devil s tooth stood with ancient wisdom that the likes of warriors and elves would glance over without a thought . it takes a mesmer to find the answers , and so i came to this peak with that in mind . newline newline warmth flooded my fingertips with each touch of the seeingdeer s tongue . it started as a prickle on the skin , dancing down each vein line in a pin and needle fashion . the movement became a swirling effect center stomach , only to whoosh back out , through my fingers , and into my quarter staff . the weapon glowed with purple power , ready to dispell time . newline newline each tip of the jagged peak stuck out like dragon teeth then , no longer the plain stone from before . it s funny how mesmer magic can give a different perspective , turning a bouquet into nature s children and a mountain peek into an ancient wisdom  the old man of the natural world . newline newline i raised both hands , letting the melody of time dance over my lips  still not knowing what to expect . wood smashed into stone and purple energy traced across the cliff face , across the clouds , and out to devil s tooth peak . newline newline the ground shuddered for a moment , and an invisible god clapped sending cloud billowing in each direction . i latched to the rock , by jamming my staff into a groove . seeingdeer dug her hooves into the snow , slowly sliding away from the force . newline newline as the power faded , an object materialized on the cliff ahead . it started with the circular structure of a skull and the bones of a giant human corpse . jutting out from the giant s stomach was a sword big enough to slice the mountain in half . newline newline my heart raced , sweat pressing to the surface of my hands and brow .  speak creature , what is your story ?  i shouted , voice echoing to and fro . newline newline the skeleton shuddered , disrupting snow into a miniature avalanche down devil s tooth peak .  the mesmer s have survived this long ?  it said , each vocal tone coming off as a roar . newline newline luckily with staff still jammed , i did nt budge too much .  to waste magic is a sin worse than wasting time . let us not tarnish your historical knowledge with modern dribble ,  i said . newline newline the skeleton seemed to agree with this , resting its head back on the mountain top .  i was once a man ,  it said ,  now nothing more than bones and rubble .  newline newline either the skeleton was confused or its memory had been shaken .  men are small , like me ,  i said , pointing at my chest ,  you are a giant , dear friend . do you remember your story ?  newline newline the skeleton chuckled the type of laugh that labels the opposition naive .  my story is one i could never forget , young mesmer . us humans were greater than the god s , changed by those who wield magic .  newline newline again , while he preached with certainty there was unbelievable about his recount  or maybe my own .  tell me your story , then , so i can judge for myself .  newline newline  if a blind man wishes to see , are you doing him a favour by showing the world ?  the skeleton let out a long sigh .  very well , but do not interrupt , as this is a tale with many endings and just as many beginnings , as you will soon understand .  newline newline newline newline all of them ?  newline newline doctor isaac krenovsky nodded with a solemn solidness that made sara bite back her follow up question . they were standing in what they had come to call the planning room . it was a tiny , dingy little office that remained the only place in the complex that was nt filled with upset designers , crazed religious lobbyists , visiting politicians or generals , or any number of other whackjobs trying to influence their work . some of them wanted masks right now to protect them from the evil drug in the atmosphere and damn the consequences , others wanted the secret hushed up and pushed for the entire lab to deny their own research . newline newline it was amazing how fast people jumped to the extremes in a crisis . newline newline  all forty eight of the last test subjects .  krenovsky continued , sitting down hard onto the ancient office chair beside sara ,  we even tried removing all the dangerous objects from the room , the last five strangled themselves using the mask itself .  newline newline dr. sara helvin frowned and stared at a particularly faded coffee stain on the desk that she had claimed as her spot  in the project . she was mostly forgotten , assigned there as the resident psychiatrist by the founder and then seemingly forgotten . still , krenovsky and a few others would come to talk to her from time to time , wrestling with the ethical implications of what they were doing . attempting to fundamentally alter the psyche of an entire nation is nt a task without consequences ... such as the death of 48 test participants . newline newline  i do nt think we can continue the testing .  krenovsky places his head in his hands ,  not after ... you did nt see the tapes , sara ... it was ... . i ... .  newline newline  i ve watched people drive themselves to that place before , but this ...  sara reached over and let her hand rest on krenovsky s shoulder for a second ,  i know you ll blame yourself , but know in your mind that this was nt your fault . i never anticipated the reaction to be so strong and that s my part to play in this . we re dealing with a toxin , just one whose effects have permeated every life , removing it wo nt be easy or kind on any of us .  newline newline krenovsky lifted his head up and wiped his eyes . then he tilted his head as he saw a look in sara s eye change . newline newline  what is it ?  newline newline  i ...  sara began , then stopped , then began again ,  i think i may have an idea . could you convince the group to allow one more test . only four people . maximum crisis control , i ll bring in some friends from a psychiatric hospital to assist .  newline newline krenovsky almost wanted to shout no  right in her face , but the look she had , like she d caught the edge of a great and beautiful picture amidst a pile of junk stopped him . newline newline  alright .  krenovsky laid the word out like a heavy tablecloth ,  but this is the last test for me . if something happens ... i cant..  newline newline  i understand , doc .  sara smiled ,  just trust me .  newline newline  newline newline three days later the whole lab watched as sara s four test subjects sat with their masks on answering questions from team after team of researchers . their iq had apparently jumped to unheard of highs . one of the four had already been gifted at the start and now they judged his mathematical aptitude to be twice that of hawking . newline newline  what was different ?  krenovsky finally found sara standing near the back of the room , her eyes sad but confident . newline newline  these four are my worst cases .  she answered . newline newline  worst of what ?  newline newline  chronic clinical depression .  sara breathed the words ,  all four have functioned while depressed to depths that caused most people to attempt suicide . these four did nt . they rationalized their own existence . each of them found a thing , just one thing to give them a reason to stay alive . it powered them through a life without any emotion .  newline newline krenovsky gaped and could nt decide whether to stare at sara or at the four miracles wearing their masks and environmental suits . newline newline  it s sad ... but it made sense .  sara laughed in dark and cynical tones ,  depression like this ... and knowing that the beneficial toxin exist ... it was the only real thing that made sense .  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  these four have some immunity to it .  sara waved her hand at the group ,  they ve never been able to process the high to its full extent , so we labelled them as depressed . we gave them other drugs to get that high back , but here , here they are just stepping off the train full of addicts and taking a good look around , realizing they were nt broken or crazy ... they were real and it was the rest of us who were broken .   in progress ...   newline newline walker swore . rain again . he d been detouring around the toxic vapor plumes and superheated flows for hundreds of miles , but the precincts of the palace were beyond all expectation . a day of scouting found no approach that did not involve leaping over streams of raw lithic feedstocks . in the end he d settled on the frontal approach , straight down the embankments of the old coronation promenade . he had hoped at least for a dry day to damp down the fires of the fusion nano , but the drops he d felt said that was nt in the cards either . there was no more time now . it was either move or give up hope . newline newline he used his command interface to select the three most athletic from his string of proles . he would leave the rest locationrestricted to the great elliptical plaza on which they d camped , surfaced with some tough material that had resisted the nano . not being optimized for critical thought or selfpreservation , unarmored and only moderately enhanced , the three he picked would not survive for long . he toyed for a moment with the idea of setting a release for the others to go feral if he did not return , but it was nt worth the effort . he did take a satchel of supplies to carry himself so that he would have something if his proles landed in the drink . newline newline the white house rumbled before him as a compromised tower selfdemolished and neatly collapsed into the flow beneath . it happened about once a day as new towers grew to replace them . he just hoped the central core remained as intact as the histories imagined it to be . newline newline despite his expectations , the first stretch of the promenade went without incident . even the proles could manage a four foot leap between sections of what must once have been a broad ceremonial railing over which guests would safely survey lawns and gardens . though they lacked proper armor , at least the proles had shoes that could resist the nano and keep firm traction on wet stone . then walker caught a hint of apprehension in the eyes of one of the proles looking back toward him for guidance . he turned and beheld the great statue that bestrode the ellipse for the first time  zeta infinity , the first emperor . without a thought  it could be dangerous to think about such things  he knelt prostrate in homage , and the proles naturally followed his lead . unfortunately one of them touched his cheek to a blob of the redhot liquid nano that had landed on the bridge , and let loose a purely instinctive scream as it began restructuring him as raw material . walker gave him a firm push on the chest that sent him off the railing  there was more of a thunk than a splash when he struck the liquid stone far below .  glory to the emperor !  he shouted , as if it had been a planned sacrifice . come to think of it , he supposed it was . newline newline it was not so easy past the final road circling the palace . the nano flowed everywhere beneath a tumble of fallen patternedstone chunks , the talus surrounding the mountainous center of the palace . every fissure belched forth some gas  ammonia , sulfide , phosgene , others with smells he did nt recognize . the proles had no breathing filters and only the most basic biochemical hardening , and were soon coughing up bloody chunks . newline newline somehow walker managed to keep the proles moving until one of them staggered before him into a dark , unobstructed entryway into one side of the palace . a moment later its software interface reported unauthorized motion , followed in seconds by loss of signal . reviewing the prole s retinal transcript in slow motion , walker could see the flying drone bring it to a prison subbasement nearly filled with liquid phase nano . newline newline walker swore again . not only were the security systems functioning  they apparently could resist the nano . if he could not use that as a weapon against them , how would he neutralize them ? he pondered the question as specks of nano fell from the towers above him and drifted on the wind toward him , sizzling on the stone or from his armor . his sole remaining prole cowered in terror behind a lone pillar . finally , he came up with an idea , and handed the prole his gun . newline newline it is always intriguing to see the remnant proud beast struggle within the harness of domesticity , and never was this more apparent . the prole could not manage a look of hatred , as that was not allowed , nor of course could it actually fire the gun to harm walker , nor formulate the intent . these things would be apprehended and stopped , and negative conditioning applied . but the prole was ever in the process of deciding to do so , even though it was not permitted to reach a decision . the proles were the last of a group that had called itself the 99 percent  , which had imagined that it could keep a primitive animalistic state of affairs forever  but they had been selected and purged , one betraying another for some scrap of advantage or a promise of freedom , until at last the most compliant had been rewarded with permanent employment . they had always hated , and their hate had always kept them working the harder . today that hate would serve walker again . newline newline he marched the last prole into the side entrance , and it was snatched up by a drone just like the last . when the elevator opened to admit it , he gave the order for it to fire .alex threw his arms in the air .  what do you mean the chinese conquered europe ?  newline newline  well , you see here ?  jerry pointed to his screen . the last few moments alex spent in thirteenth century syria before the crusaders arrived .  you stole an apple from that merchant.  newline newline  it was just an apple.  newline newline jerry nodded .  the incident traces with 95  certainty to this moment.  newline newline  how would an apple cause the chinese to invade europe ?  newline newline  it looks like the guy arrested for your crime was the assassin sent to kill prince edward in 1272 when he was on crusade . in our timeline , edward killed the assassin instead and went on towell , you know all that . anyway , in this new timeline , this guy lost his hand , so they sent someone else . this other assassin succeeded in killing the future king.  newline newline  and ?  alex demanded . god , he hadn  t fucked up this badly in years . the amount of paperwork would be staggering . newline newline  so edward  s brother became king instead . edmund did alright , but his son lost england to the french.  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  oh yeah . they speak french in britain now . english is officially a dead language.  newline newline  christ.  newline newline  looks like you upset the applecart ,  jerry said with a nod . newline newline  i will shoot you ,  alex growled . newline newline  so after the french conquer the british , they go on to colonize north america and end up at war with spain . quebec is almost exactly the same in this time oddly enough . anyway , everything runs smoothly for a while until world war i.  newline newline  we still had one of those ?  newline newline jerry peered at him over his horn rimmed glasses .  we  ve had four of those.  newline newline  four world wars ?  alex had to sit down . he needed a drink . for a moment he feared vodka didn  t exist anymore and didn  t want to ask . finally he sank his head into his hands .  so how do we fix this ?  newline newline  management is sending you back to syria . you  re going to lose a hand , i  m afraid.  newline newline alex stared at his hand . he flexed his fingers and swallowed the lump in his throat .  could nt they just send me to edward s tent in 1272 ?  newline newline  they re not taking any chances . you know how this works . we fix the past as close to the incident as possible .  newline newline a hand was a small price to pay for the english language , he supposed .  you  ll have to do my paperwork.  newline newline  oh no . management  s not letting you off that easily.  newline newlinewhen i was 6 i summoned adolf hitler , he was about to shoot himself but then he realised where he was . now , 14 years later the fourth reich is going well , the state of knowledge was deemed medieval by adolf , but 14 years later and a lot of nazi scientistsengineers summoned . the enitre country is being modernized , culture is booming , shows and plays and radioes are a hit . train rails are being placed down everyday connecting us to the great capital berlin . at the beginning it was tough , we had to rally the people to work for us which was nt easy . but after reviving entire panzer divisions we murdered all lords and kings . reinstating them with city workers who control city development . all in all people abandoned the ways of old and i became the emperor . they all put down their swords in defeat knowing that i ca nt be defeated . we are now going to teleport me to ww2 berlin so i get to be shot and can revive myself . eternal life in this empire does nt sound so bad . especially considering we can only go forward , united at last .i hated them . newline newline it was because of them that i was stuck here , in this stupid research lab . newline newline but i was not alone . there were 11 others with me , all of us given a room  each . except it felt more like a cage . the area was heavily guarded , with sercurity personnels at every alternate cell . scientists would come and go , poking us every now and then , taking blood samples and whatnot . newline newline  please ,  i asked for the hundredth time , when my researcher came in .  when can we leave ? we ve been here for weeks .  newline newline the man in the coat and mask simply shrugged as he checked my blood pressure . then he promptly left . i groaned in frustration , and hit my fists against the glass wall . the security guy swivelled around and aimed his gun at me . i stared daggers at him , and as the anger welled up inside of me , the lines on my arms glowed brighter . newline newline it all started when the earthquake happened a few weeks ago in the central business district , except it was nt really an earthquake . tall , humanoid figures with glowing amber skin emerged from the ground . they had no exact features to speak of just rough indents for the eyes , and a slight protrusion for the nose . they just stood there at first , still and quiet . newline newline the military soon came in , guns trailed on them , and the news teams were all over the place . these strange creatures were dubbed the golden people . next thing we knew , people on the streets began to gravitate towards them , surrounding them like a protective wall . newline newline then each of these people turned to face the cameras , and they spoke in unision ,  we mean your people no harm . we have dwelled the core of your home for millions of years , and now the time has come for us to return . but to do so , we need a select few to provide us with assistance . we hope to have your cooperation .  newline newline then , the civillians all dropped to the ground  it was later reported that they were unharmed . newline newline but that was also when the orange lines appeared on my body . it started as a dot on my finger , and soon blossomed into an intricate pattern that spread all the way up my neck and face . it was nt long before the government found me and had me relocated to that research base , and that was when i realised i was nt the only one . newline newline some believed that we were what the golden meant by select few   the government thought we might have been infected with some virus . newline newline i did nt care . i justed wanted to go home . newline newline a noise jolted me out of my thoughts . the guard outside my cell had crumpled to the ground , and my door slid open . a middleaged woman came into view i recognised her as my neighbor . her eyes and skin glowed orange . newline newline  come ,  she said , reaching out to me .  it s time .  newline newline i blinked in confusion , not comprehending what was going on , what just happened . i noticed that the lines on my skin were getting brighter and i began to panick . newline newline then , it hit me hard . a wave of calm and a profound understanding overcame me . i smiled . newline newline everything became clear .an open prompt on reddit ? fucking bring it . i can see my reflection in the window above my desk . i wonder if he knows our first semester of college gave us a double chin . of course he does . he is me . then he must remember the hurt in his family s eyes when their first collegebound student told them his first semester would be his last . a silent disappointment that ca nt be hidden in reassuring words . if he is me then who am i ? i do nt remember . too long have i tried to fulfill others vicariousness . baby steps , buddy , it s just you and me .usually it starts with an idea or concept . basic stuff . then that idea gets more and more complex , sometimes changing in large amounts so that it no longer looks like the basic idea . then i take that , layer out the complex ideaconceptstory over a series of events within the world i place it in  usually one i ve made up myself  in segments , or chapters more accurately , and proceed to write them out with the characters and letting their personality and decisions control the flow . newline newline for example , down to the very basic core idea of a novel i ve written , it could be said as this guy dies and goes to the afterlife  . newline newline from there i can continue to add more detail . say that this guy is nt alone . say that an entire town ended up following him into the afterlife . now this man is somewhat like a priestpoliceman , and there s now all these people in the afterlife with him . as he s sort of a priest he knows what to do , but everyone else does not . so as a policeman he takes it upon himself to help these people through the afterlife . now for the killer detail of this part , the man knows who killed these people , and he knows they re the ones who ended up getting him killed , and them killed in response . newline newline boom , that s a lot more detail , right ? well i could keep going . newline newline now there s some sort of evil spirit monsters running around in the afterlife out to consumedestroy the priest and the people . they try to lure people away and destroy them , and the policeman has to stop that from happening while they try to reach a safe haven  or a paradise   . now that adds some conflict and action . newline newline alright , so eventually this man gets everyone to a safe place . but where are all these evil monsters coming from ? a certain dead evil villain from times long past that s been imprisoned in this afterlife . well what can be done about that ? the man ends up learning how and that he s the only one willing and able to defeat the old villain and get rid of the monsters , and sets out to do so with someone to help guide him . newline newline i could continue as there s still way more detail , but for sake of not writing too much i wo nt . but that s generally how i write . i think of a simple ideaconcept and place specific characters into them , and roll out from there .am i a god ? i have seen the rise of every empire the world had ever known , i watched every sunset and every sun rise . to the world s credit and credit to its leaders they tried . it was innevitable , they would fight when provoked and the conjachons had them just that . war among world s had begun and nothing could save my species they were irradicated . newline newline newline i was a survivor not because i was a special force the war could nt destroy but because i was chosen by them to become a test subject long before fire lit the caves of what would be modern man . newline newline newline through time i had figured i d known all there was and studied the world s most fasinating subjects . until i was left alone in the darkest pockets of space i came to see a light , not of an outside source but of the mind . newline newline newline we were an event in a small portion of a small galaxy only touching the vast , deep and cold space . life is nt about any one person , not any one event and not any one circumstance but the accumulation that creates the tapestry of our small story . as i see the different world s from so far away i see no one world cares for another or even bothers to see one another for fear of being to different to work towards universal expansions . newline newline newline we are nt a special tribe but another failed attempt in the universe s quest for assimilation .look ye , look ye ! newline newline gaze yonder pon newline newline

william hung up his phone as the cab sped away from the airport . he had nt thought much about those teenage years , or what he and his friends did . this kind of get together was to remind them of a youth that they all sacrificed . they may not like each other , hell , william probably held the most disdain for each of them , but they were united in the fact they were given too much responsibility too early in life . newline newline he thinks about the greetings he s going to have to give . there s maybe one of the group he s always had feelings for , but kim has long since been

find it demeaning when that asshole called him billy . knows how much he hates it . newline newline the car pulled up to william s destination . he paid the cabbie , took a deep breath and stepped out . with each step up to the door he thought of leaving . with each false hug he gave everyone , he thought of running out . as someone turned on the tv and pressed play , he thought of jumping through a window . as he saw his younger self with his younger friends with a young zordon behind them he thought , newline newline why the fuck did i ever say yes to these assholes ?every step taken was one of hope . it was the exact opposite of dark , blinding . looking merely inches from his highly drawn cheeks and crinkled brow , nothing seemed certain . the petrified wood was to lie comfortably under his sole for some time before his small spurts of courage balanced him onto another . the duration of this journey held no stopwatch . for if in an instant someone theorized an average to cross this bridge , that number would be thrown out the instant another attempt began . men successful in the trek were awarded with a lifetime of decoration and acknowledgement , but those who failed were never deemed men at all . his dreams now mimicked a compilation of every dream . to one day make a living doing what he loved without ever having another petrified  would ?  just under his soul .i shook myself free from a long daydream . how long had i been standing here ? before me i see the back of someone s head and long dark hair , a cell phone raised to their ear . she s awfully loud , rude even , and that s when i realized it was the incessant noise of a mob of angry people surrounding me that finally budged me loose from my blissful musing . newline newline i shift my glance around , taking it all in , people standing around with disgruntled looks on their face . every last one of the impatiently fidgeting and muttering under their breaths . the unrest hanging as thick upon the air as the abundant noxious body odor of dozens of unwashed migrants like yourself , one and all awaiting ... what were we waiting for , again ? i hear a loud glossed overly polite voice , one which lazily feigns the attempt of hiding the discontent , even disgust , in their voice . the line shifts a few feet . how long had i been in line here ? i just had my licensed renewed ... maybe it was to pay some fine ... newline newline i get lost in my thoughts for some time , taking myself far from the crowd of people . hiding in my special place once more ... newline newline moments pass until a cough

him a fatalist , a masochist , even a satanist . he believed himself above such titles . since the dawn of life , nature has functioned on a cycle of birth , maturity , and death . mankind had once been a willing participant in this cycle . the black death , which ravaged europe hundreds of years ago , was proof of this . however , as he grew , he discovered that man broken surpassed its old boundaries . overpopulation was rampant and science was interfering with the natural law . the law of the earth is above any that human government can create . it must not be trifled with . the world is long overdue for a great disease to cleanse it of the weak . as he boarded the plane out of liberia , understanding fully his own symptoms , he knew that he would be the one restore law to the land

propulsive force than three . it needed every iota of strength . newline newline she drifted back . there was movement . a small beep sounded in her ear as someone took position inside the scope . it was him . her cheek felt the groove of the stock press harder against her . she took a breath . she let it go . this bullet would change the universe . maus would see it . he would tell her that she had done good . she knew it . she pulled the trigger . newlinewhen i was younger i always thought my grandparents had their own madeup language . it sounded like a melody , almost like they were singing to each other . i always used to ask them why they had their own language , but they just smiled and told me   you will know when you get older , honey .  newline newline i pouted , i was going to find out no matter what . i eavesdropped and memorised some of the words ,  bertta  ,  henne  and  troll  . i continued to eavesdrop , i learned a couple of words , but not much more than that . but there was always a variety of the same sentence that they repeated , but i never understood what they meant with it   du vet varfr vi gr det , snart r tiden inne .  sometimes i repeated this sentence before i was going to sleep , it made me happy , i was onto them . newline newline last summer i found out the language they are speaking is swedish , and since i have always wanted to learn the language i took some courses . i was so excited when i got my certificate , i went straight to my grandparents house to show them . newline newline as we drank tea i told them about my course and i repeated the phrase they always used to say   du vet varfr vi gr det , snart r tiden inne .  and made some forced joke about how incredible i was to have found out their secret language .

baal frowned until the crease in his burnscarred forehead seemed as an infinite abyss of darkness . smoke rose from his nostrils and curled up and around his head and long twisted horns . each time he opened his terrible mouth to utter lamentations and filth , dark hungry flames licked his lips , searing off flesh and tasting the bone beneath . the demon crossed his arms , his muscles bulging with the power to move continents , the intricate markings burnt into his skin glowing and snaking about his elbows and shoulders . newline newline for months he had been inactive , his beloved place at satan  s right hand lost to him . recession ! he snorted furiously , flames flaring , his eyes deep and dark . a recession in hell ! it was ridiculous . and even more ridiculous , that his place had been handed over to some underling , some newcomer to the demon ranks who worked for less reward . newline newline he stepped along the searing passageway  he held his head high in order to tear with his sharp horns those struggling souls who had been embedded in the ceiling . their screams delighted him as he passed . listen well , he told himself bitterly , for these will be the last heartwarming screams you will hear for a long time . newline newline finally he arrived and with one bizarre hand that was part paw , part human hand and webbed between the fingers , he opened the door . a snarl escaped him , ringing off into the distance , horrible , causing the ears of those souls who heard to bleed . the most excruciatingly dull room in hell . he walked in , slammed the door behind himself and gazed around the room . long weird sounds came from his mouth in a breath of black smoke . demon profanities at their worst , untranslatable to any human tongue . newline newline the room looked like any bureaucrat  s office in the mortal realm . a desk , swivel chair , computer , even a stained and chipped coffee mug that someone had placed there for shits and giggles . already the monitor shone with fresh questions . magic 8 ball . before this day , baal had not known what a magic 8 ball was , and when he had been told , he didn  t believe it . he knew humans came up with all sorts of stupid shit , but this ? at least , back in the day , when he still paid attention to the humans who looked to magic for hope and answers , people still used the fun methods . sacrifices , knives , fires . now , this . newline newline should i leave my husband ? another oath escaped his blackened mouth and baal bent to touch the keyboard . fuck yes . in the mortal world , the woman stared at her magic 8 ball , put it down and walked away . newline newline will i be found out if i kill my neighbour  s dog ? baal laughed , an awful sound that made human  s bellies turn to water . no , kill the fucking mongrel . the man on earth smiled and went to fetch his shotgun . newline newline suddenly the demon growled . how long had it been since he walked into this hellforsaken room ? three years ? five decades ? baal roared , tore the computer from the desk and shattered it on the steaming floor . satan would give him back his old job if he had to gut every demon in hell , if he had to tear the fingernails and teeth from each and every person in hell himself , if he had to newline newline baal looked up , catching sight of the mysterious sign on the wall . the chasmfrown deepened on his brow once more . newline newline the kitten on the charred poster bewildered him , the furry thing clinging to a branch , its little white paws clinging for dear life . newline newline hang in there . the demon sighed , hanging his head , his immense horns suddenly seeming to weigh a tonne . he turned to the newly appeared computer and read the next question : if i kissed two boys at the party last night , does that make me a slut ? without a doubt . newline newline baal assumed the worndown posture of workers the earth over , his talons clicking on the keys as he went about his work . newlineso there i was , playing roulette at the tops . i was up a few caps for once and i had a nice buzz going after a few drinks when i saw these two fellas walk right passed all the tables and right up to benny . benny was the ceo of the chairmen , one of the factions that ran the city of new vegas and owned the tops casino . i couldn  t hear what they were saying but i could tell these guys weren  t here to gamble or drink , they were here on business . this got my attention . the first guy was dressed pretty normal . he had an ncr beret on , and anyone that  s ever been to new vegas knows that ncr troops on r  r flock to the strip . he was standing there , not saying much . the guy who was doing the talking was wearing something that caught my attention though , a pipboy . newline newline as i watched their conversation i could begin to tell that benny wasn  t exactly happy to see these two , and that the two men weren  t very happy with him . eventually the two walked away and benny went upstairs with his body guards . i watched the visitors as they walked to the other end of the casino and stood near the bar for a few minutes before taking the same elevator upstairs that benny and his goon squad took . at this point i knew that something was going on between the two men and the chairmen and so i cashed my chips in , got my .44 magnum and hunting knife from the front desk , and waited across the street . newline newline after a while the two men came out of the casino and started to walk down the street . i followed them for a bit and watched as the guy with the beret stopped and stood out front waiting by the securitron , while the guy with the pipboy waltzed right up the stairs of the lucky 38 and walked inside like they own the place ! according to the locals no one has been in that place for years ! now these guys had my attention . i walked backed over to the tops to investigate . newline newline  sorry pal , we  re closed.  said the chairman working the door .  closed ? since when do casinos close ?  i replied .  look fella , i ain  t gunna tell you again . now scram baby , before i get angry.  my curiosity was peaked , but i left . there was no way i could take all the chairmen in a fight in their own casino . i wanted to know who these two guys were so i went back to the lucky 38 . just as i arrived the guy wearing the pipboy came out and i ended up following the guys into freeside . they went into the atomic wrangler and rented a room . i walked around the casino and played a few spins of slots to waste some time . then i went to the front desk to rent a room myself . i needed to get some rest , i wanted to be awake before these other two guys and i had a feeling i was going to be pretty busy tomorrow . newline newlinelydya sat cross legged in the center of the firepit , feeling the tongues of flame flicker against her skin . she was meant to be meditating , and if any of the other students had glanced her way , that s what it would appear she was doing . she was less certain that her stillness would be enough to fool teacher , but he had nt called her out on it thus far . newline newline the exercise was designed to get the students to a place where they could forget the burn of the fire even in the moments it kissed them . the idea was to train them , so that they could become better firefighters , one day capable of beating any blaze into submission without being distracted by pain . but lydya did nt want to forget the pain , she wanted to feel it . she knew , it would not stop her . it would make her stronger . newline newline no one had ever seen someone fight the fire the way lydya did . everyone knew the fire was more than it seemed , that it had evolved into a living thing that needed to be beaten to be subdued . or at least , they said they knew . but only lydya treated it like the living beast it was . newline newline lydya knew how to dance with the fire . to make it bend the way she wished , spread the direction she wished all it took was a carefully placed series of strikes for the fire to flinch away from her , or a few unexpected caresses to draw it near . lydya knew had to curl the fire in on itself , so that its tendrils might suffocate under one another s weight . newline newline lydya knew how to make the fire fear her , and the people around her sensed it . they grew to fear her too . newline newline she wished she could make the people understand there was nothing strange about her , she d only figured out what should have been obvious to them all that fire was a thing meant to be harnessed . that it was mankind  s destiny to claim it as a tool to enhance their world . newline newline silently , lydya fluttered her hand , fanning a young flame that had bloomed beside her in the firepit , helping the flame to grow until its wisp was tall and its heart burned blue . smiling , in one quick motion she brought down her palm and smothered it . newline newline she met teacher  s eye . newline newline the tests were coming soon , and those would determine who would go on to fight on the front lines of the great war with the neverending inferno , the fire that had been consuming the west half of their nation  s lands since long before lydya had been born . this was what lydya had been working for all these years she could practically smell the way her skin would crackle as she battled back the flames , her arms and legs raining down a never ending stream of blows . newline newline but first , there was the question of if she would even be allowed to take the tests . newline newline there had been talk . around the academy , even amongst the higher ups . it was clear to everyone that lydya was gifted , but also that she was strange . she made people uncomfortable . they didn  t understand how she did the things she did with fire , and when she tried to explain they only grew more uneasy . they weren  t sure they  d let lydya take the test , that they  d take her to fight the neverending inferno . they weren  t sure what would happen if lydya was allowed to interact with that much flame . newline newline after the lesson in the firepit , teacher pulled her aside . he told her a story , a warning from a time before the fire lived . back when fire was mindless , burned without soul or direction . when mankind easily used it in precisely the way lydya had always believed they could . when simply water was enough to defeat its force . he told lydya of a woman who had breathed life into the fire , and taught it to be more , trained the fire to obey her commands . when the people of her land saw her dance with the fire , they were frightened . they killed the woman . and so the fire rebelled , and began consuming the earth . and so the neverending inferno began . newline newline people had seen lydya dance with the fire , just the way the woman once had . it made them uneasy . newline newline the day of the test came , and lydya was allowed to take it . she did not know how to be less than what she was , despite teacher  s warning , and she frightened all who saw her . lydya would not be allowed to see the great inferno , no . newline newline lydya would not be allowed to live . newline newline lydya would be sacrificed by fire , as was the way of the firefighters . she would be afforded that dignity , at least . but her arms and legs were bound , and she was tied and hoisted up on a stake they could not risk her fighting the fire into submission . but what they did not know is lydya did not need her arms or legs she had the flutter of her eyelids , the tilt of her head , the pucker of her lips . with these alone lydya soothed the fire , she eased it , she convinced it to fear her and flicked it in the direction she desired . it ate away at her binds , and lydya became free . newline newline lydya burned the academy to the ground , and in the confusion she and her teacher escaped . newline newline many towns over , but not nearly far enough , teacher secured lydya passage to the borderlands . from there , she could walk straight into the neverending inferno . no one would be there to stop her for who would want to try what she intended to try ? lydya bid teacher farewell . she would never see him again . newline newline lydya would tame the inferno . she would teach it not to fear her , but to love her . she would spend her days dancing amidst its burn , where she belonged . lydya realized the foolishness of thinking mankind should harness the fire , that they could use it as their tool . they did not deserve the fire , they did nt understand it . none of them . newline newline the fire was free . and now , so was she .oh . bond brought you here ? i do believe it s time for me to begin . newline newline  where am i ?  newline newline did i give you permission to talk ? ... newline newline you may answer my

teeth . 32 teeth to be exact . it seems you have regular visits to your dentist ... newline newline what s his secret ? or shall i find out myself ? or ... newline newline he sits down in front of you . he crouches down to meet your gaze .  newline newline or shall you tell me yours , mister lime ? newline newline ... newline newline pity . newline newline he places the wire around your teeth . when he presses a button , you feel a slight pierce in your teeth , that intensifies along with a drilling sound . you scream , yet with every bit of air that brushes against your teeth , your dental roots start to burn . your mouth is now soaked with blood .  newline newline they do nt call me the dentist for nothing . now will you answer my question , or shall you lose a few teeth ? newline newline he brings out pliers from his toolkit .  newline newline do you see these ? newline newline he waves the pliers to your eyes that drip with tears . you tremble in agony . you nod rapidly .  newline newline you look like you have a few ... cavities in your teeth . oh what to do ... what to do ... i may have to remove some of them . i prefer not to use anesthetic , as it may sometimes slow the healing process . or ... i could kill you now and save you the pain . which one will it be ? the pulling ? or the swift release of death ? newline newline you nod keenly and quickly as soon as he mentions  death  .  newline newline now tell me , mister lime ... of course you know why you re on the list . you know what you ve done , and we at mi6 know , too . newline newline he comes closer .  newline newline tell me , mister lime ... where are you keeping the queen ? newline newline you gurgle your answer , but he seems to understand it  he has his ear held up in front of you and he smiles with a nod .  newline newline very , good , mister lime . newline newline he takes a phone out of his pocket .  newline newline did you hear all of that , m ? newline newline yes , i heard all of it . come back to base at once for your debriefing .  newline newline what shall i do with mister lime , here ? shall i reward him for his ... compliance ? newline newline you may do whatever you wish , 004 .  newline newline cheerio , mister lime . newline newline he walks away and turns the light off . the door swings open and bright lights flood the room . he stands there for a second and comes walking back briskly .  newline newline i forgot ! your cavity . newline newline he takes his pliers out and removes your lower right molar . you scream in pain as blood slowly fills up your mouth causing your breaths to gurgle .  newline newline good bye and good eve , mister lime . newline newline he reaches the front door and closes it behind him , leaving you to die from either shock , blood loss , or suffocation . or all of them . here lies danel at my feet , frozen in agony , and his mouth wide with his last scream . there by the wall lies yuna s body and , half the room over , her head , but no blood , only her gears and cogs and a long metal spine . i clench my teeth in anger at her struggle to sentience , cut short at its peak . across the room , four hooves dabbing in a pool of fetid water , human arms wrapped around his beloved , toz smiles in the end , finally at peace with his changing body and with seneca , the centaur warriormare he clings to even now . newline newline in the middle , the hilllike body of the last guardian , worn down by a thousand wounds and killed by my final stab through his mouth and out the back of his throat . as i watch with clenched fists , his body disintegrates into a small pile of fine ash . on top of it rests my sword and beside the sword a crystal ball with fine etchings . newline newline all of our adventures , our long journey and friendship boiled down to a pile of ash and this  this trinket . i step around my friend s body and kneel down to pick up my sword . the ball shines in the light , and i consider leaving it . let the world rot . let it fall to pieces . i do nt care anymore . newline newline i sheath my sword . i stand up . i turn around . i walk away . i leave the crystal ball , and i never return . some other heroes can save the world . i ve already lost mine .the seas bubbled , thick with the building blocks of life , as jack ate his lunch on the edge of a cliff . tiny crumbs of bread fell and were caught by the wind , but jack paid them no mind . yes , there were half a dozen regulations that promised painful death to any doubleas that brought foreign biological matter onto a prelife world without the proper clearance . newline newline jack did nt care . he had nt eaten breakfast that morning , and it was impossible to manufacture the end of a world on an empty stomach . newline newline jack swallowed the last of his sandwich , feeling the tiny legs of the sandwich s meat wriggle as they passed down his throat . he belched , and then opened up his toolbox to start working . vials of engineered chemicals glowed unnaturally in the small box , and jack flipped through the trays like the pages of a book to find the one he needed . newline newline  let s see , green for an oxygen atmosphere , level three for a white dwarf star ...  he mumbled to himself , searching for the proper vial . he found the tray of green vials , but one of the containers was empty .  oh , drat .  that was right  it had been a busy morning seeding death in worlds that might bring about intelligent life , and he d been assigned a lot of planets with oxygenrich atmospheres orbiting a white dwarf . he puckered one of his mouths  this might be a problem . newline newline he could head back to the office to restock , but he had a quota to fill that cycle , and the time spent getting more vials would be better spent seeding more planets . newline newline hum . a conundrum . newline newline jack eventually shrugged his numerous tentacles , and took a green level one and two from the trays . he overturned them , letting the glowing green liquids mix together as they fell to the bubbling sea below . his logic was infallible : green level one plus green level two equals green level three . he was just an apocalypse architect , he did nt understand how the stuff worked . newline newline not many did . it was a complex , volatile substance that was used to sterilize planets that might develop multicellular life , which might in turn lead to intelligent life , which would in turn lead to trouble . a cocktail of protein chains and viruses that would spread like a plague  because , well , technically it was a plague  through every singlecelled life form on a prenatal world . it would prevent the proper bonds from forming that would allow a singlecelled organism to evolve past that stage , preventing them from developing into troubles for the rest of the universe . it was crowded enough already , thank you . newline newline jack , satisfied at a job well done , brushed some more crumbs off his front , scooped up his toolbox , and began to hover back to his ship . the silvery needle left the planet , the third such one orbiting this particular star , behind , and mike , like all lifeforms who are paid to do a job without thinking too much , forgot about it entirely . newline newline he could nt have known that the formulas , specifically prepared to be used solely on a certain type of world , would interact so violently , the viruses tearing each other apart . he could nt have known that the crumbs from his sandwich would contain a particular element that had been missing from the world so far , one that would provide the final building block for life that had been missing from that world . newline newline the world was forgotten by the universe , and so nobody saw , millions of years later , when the planet s surface had cooled and its waters had calmed , a slimy little fish drag itself out of the water . newline newline and nobody could have known about the amazing things that would one day happen on that pale blue dot . newline newline   newline newline check out my  blog   http : theballadsofirving.wordpress.com  for other things i ve written .we first found the planet they called earth nearly 100 cycles ago . it was rich in minerals , covered in water , and it orbited a young , yellow star . it was perfect for colonization . the catch ? it was already inhabited by a species known as humans . newline newline the humans were primitive . we learned from their own  internet  that they had advanced quickly in the last 100 cycles , but this was not saying much . the humans could barely reach orbit , let alone construct a ship that could even stand a chance against our fleet . not to mention the state of their government . newline newline we were arrogant . we figured that if we wiped out a city or two with a mothership they would surrender . perhaps then , we could give them a different place to live . with a bit of terraforming , the planet venus would make a perfect home as it had similar gravity and was still geologically active . newline newline so our mothership descended upon the city of  new york  . we started by sending a transmission to their leaders , speaking about our plan to relocate them . negotiations were pointless . as expected they did not want to move . newline newline they made this message clear in the form of 48 flying machines . they were fast , but they were no match for our mothership s defense lasers and shields . in a matter of minutes the entire force was wiped out . newline newline so the humans did not respond well to words . this was expected , as the humans were a primitive species . maybe they would react well to force then . the mothership charged its beam and wiped out the city . newline newline again , we attempted to talk . this time , however , there was a long period before we got their message . it contained four words . newline newline  we . will . never . surrender .  newline newline our leaders laughed . they thought that there was nothing the humans could do to stop us . after all , the shields could easily resist a fusion bomb or two and besides , the humans seemed to be against using such weapons in the first place . newline newline then it appeared  a lump of uranium and explosives inside a metal tube propelled by an inefficient chemical reaction . there was one at first , it was promptly shot down , but then there were 10 , then 100 , and then we lost count . the humans had produced so many of these devices that they overwhelmed the mothership s shields and had actually managed to shoot it down . newline newline so we left the planet alone . it was nt worth the effort as there would be other worlds with less annoying species . perhaps we would pay them a visit later , when we had some form of cheap countermeasure for their swarms of nuclear devices . newline newline this was a mistake . like an infection , the humans festered . our attack gave them motivation to finally unite as a species , and within 20 cycles they had created their first warp capable ships . newline newline the ships were mockeries constructed from reverse engineering the mothership they had nuked . yet they were excellent strategists . as it turns out , a history of war had refined their craft . newline newline it started with one planet . it was a relatively new colony , outfitted with only a few frigates at the edge of our territory . the humans caught the fleet by surprise . they used dirty tactics . they hid behind asteroids , they cloaked their ships , and they even used our own ships against us through a technique they called  electronic warfare  . this was against every rule in our code of war , but what could we expect from such a primitive species ? newline newline like a virus they spread throughout our territory , taking over everything in sight and then using it to fortify their own ranks . billions were slaughtered by friendly fire alone as their ships were almost indistinguishable from our own . newline newline one infamous example is the massacre of yoltarr . civilians looked up and cheered as a battle scarred fleet flew overhead . it had seemed that they had won the battle . then , they were all silenced when the ships charged their photon cannons and open fired . newline newline today our own ships surround our planet , manned by the dreaded virus known as humans . this is the last stronghold of our great race . newline newline the humans have sent us a message asking once more for our surrender . this is not the first time they have asked , for we have ignored countless requests in the past . this time was different , because we sent a reply . newline newline  we . will . never . surrender .  newline newline last excerpt from the journal of emperor voltak vii , the final emperor of the only sentient species mankind has ever encountered . it seems we are alone in this universe , and we have only ourselves to blame . first came war . the bombs killed off billions , mostly in cities . if you lived in the country though you were mostly fine . newline newline then came famine . the fallout turned the earth s soil black and then it rained , a radioactive rain schorched the earth s surface meaning nothing could grow . the amazon , the congo , the rolling plains and the high forests : all dessert and deserted . newline newline last came death . anyone who was nt dead yet just fell . the remnants of society were wiped off the face of the earth . newline newline all except me . i do nt know why they left me , but when i went outside , everyone was dead . there has been only silence , no one knocking , no bloody post just me and my thoughts here . newline newline until today . the bell screeched out to me , burning my ears like a flamethrower . i had nt heard anything like that since , since before the war . i crept out , who could it be at this hour ? could someone else had survived ? newline newline i went out to the door  slowly approaching it with great trepidation and then i heard the most ergregious , horrid noise i had ever in my life : newline newline  we wish you a merry christmas , newline newline we wish you a merry christmas , newline newline we wish you a merry christmas , newline newline and a happy new year ! hide those cables  , i started to get stressed . we were about to take off and jane s cables were in plain sight .  they re going to notice it  . newline newline jane and i started working out our plan a few months ago . we invited two companions to hijack this plane with us : eric and jerome . it was nt until a few months later that eric and jerome went their own way . they did nt value our motives , yet knew we had to do it . newline newline  here she goes  , jane said . we felt the plane driving faster .  this is our moment , kane , this is the moment we can make a difference  . our motives were simple : we had to hijack this plane to improve air security . we were fed up with all these terrorist attacks and hijacks . we had to prove it was nt going well , had to show the leaks . even if it killed us . newline newline i got pushed back into my chair as we took off . my heart was beating faster than it ever had before . this was the day i was going to make the difference i had always wanted in life . from birth my goals was to become unforgettable . to be read about in history books . to be seen as the hero that saved countless lives . and this was the best way to do it . newline newline i had never seen jane this happy . it was almost evil . we worked out our plan : we get up during the flight , start yelling we are hijacking the plane , make the pilot land and start communicating with the authorities afterwards . it was a solid plan . it took months of preparation . it even involved hiring a hitman to kill eric and jerome . if you ca nt do it one way , you got ta do it the other way . newline newline i heard some rumbling behind me . it did nt really occur to me that much that there were about 200 other people on this flight . the people right behind me seemed nervous . but i flew before , i know people get nervous . newline newline i hear the seat belt light going out . it was almost time . we said we d do it 20 minutes after the light would go out . time for a good drink first . i eased my mind a bit and saw the steward coming our way . newline newline  good morning , sir . what can i get you ?  , he asked , with a slight bitter undertone . i asked him how he was doing . just like any kind steward he said he was alright . yet the undertone in his voice made me feel otherwise . i asked him again , pointing out that he sounded a bit bitter . newline newline  it s just the usual , he said . we re an hour late due to hijack threats  . i started laughing internally . he will be in for a surprise . newline newline  i see , well , was the danger cleared ?  , i asked .  yes , yes sir , there is no threat right now  . it seemed like an ironic answer , cause i knew it d be otherwise . newline newline  everybody hands up !  , i heard from the back of the plane . i freaked out . how could this happen ? do the authorities know about us ? i did nt dare look back to see who it was . newline newline  put your hands up or we will blow up the plane  , i heard a second voice say . the letters w , t and f were all that was left in my mind right now . a second hijack ? we had nt even done ours yet . we were still 10 minutes away . newline newline  no , you put your hands up  . the steward got up and opened his shirt . jane freaked out . i freaked out . the steward was wearing a bomb vest and holding a wired button in his left hand . i could nt handle it for a second , this was not where i thought my day was headed . danger by the time we landed , sure . but danger up in the air ? our plan was ruined . newline newline i could nt take it anymore , i got up .  you !  , i yelled at the steward .  come over here !  . the steward looked confused and started laughing .  i said , come over here !  the other passengers were looking at me like i was crazy . maybe i was , all i knew is that i had to make the best out of our own situation , i still wanted credits for this hijack and i was nt going down in history on a passengers death list . newline newline jane was looking at me . i nodded at her . she knew this was the signal . jane got up and took of her shirt . now , i know we had a lot more preparation than the steward , but jane s vest was really , really advanced . you have to imagine a teletubbylike bomb vest including a timer , a screen and a camera . we were going to film the entire hijack . i guess all we re filming now is a terrorist standoff . newline newline the other passengers started yelling . there was some chinese , some arabic , but mainly just of pile of shits  and fucks  flying around from every corner in the plane . newline newline a team of 5 people got up , pulling guns and threatening to kill every one of us . this was just met with lots of laughter from the other passengers . that s when i realized i was nt the only person here the hijack the plane . it seemed everybody was . newline newline i had to find a good solution . i had to get out here safely yet become a hero . i needed to get a plane , yet first it involved getting the other hijackers to give up their plans . newline newline  i am serious  , i started yelling .  i will kill every single one of you , be prepared to meet my gods  . there was a silence from the plane .  your gods ?  , someone asked .  yes , jane will blow up this entire plane and take you to heaven with us .  newline newline there was some laughter from the crowd , yet panic . it was probably the dumbest line i ever said . yet something snapped in their brains . i completely destroyed their motives . there was no goal for them , no eternal life , no virgins , just my own made up heaven  at least that s what i hoped they were thinking . i actually had no idea and really just needed them to calm the hell down . newline newline it somehow worked .  if i ever have to retell this story i am definitely going to write a better line for that , i ca nt believe they fell for this  , i thought . i just did nt have the time now . i needed to focus . newline newline  i will blow all of you up !  , i repeated as i was walking to the cockpit . jane brought a small , harmless bomb to open the cockpit door .  hurry up , jane , blow that sucker out  , i frantically started yelling . i was totally into this . this was going to be my moment . newline newline a small explosion followed and the door to the cockpit was open .  shit !  , i yelled as i looked at the pilot . the pilot was dead . i looked to the right , looking straight into the barrel of a gun .  i have some bad news for you  , the copilot said .  i m hijacking this plane  . newline newline  you ve got to be kidding me  , i said . i could nt take it anymore . something in my head just snapped and made me feel totally out of control . i grabbed the gun and his arm .  no , you re not  , i said as i looked him straight into his eyes .  i am hijacking this plane  . the look on his face was priceless . it was as if he saw his last glimpse of hope fly out the window and get slashed in the plane engine . newline newline i told him to land the plane . i told him to find the first airfield we could land at . and , to my very own surprise , he did . he listened . he listened very well , as if there was a gun aimed at his head . which made sense , because at that exact moment i was aiming the gun at this head . newline newline the whole situation and the nerves just made me zone out . jane was there with me all along , she was the one that kept me on track .  stay clear , jack  , she must ve said it a hundred times . newline newline it must have been 30 minutes before i really got back to my senses . we landed at the airfield and i got completely back in control . newline newline it was time to contact the authorities . i was too excited by this . this was the moment i had been living up to for months now , and it finally reached the end . i could see the finish line , i could taste the heroism that would overcome me in the next decades . newline newline i could see the news headlines already : newline  jack and jane hijacked a hijacked plane teslok , you have good flow in your writing . the story here is very interesting and there are a lot of good scenes . i found the pacing to be too fast , however , for the amount of things that happen in the story . to full introduce twelve characters and include the raft , river side , cave , sub station , second raft , ritual , chase , and thread of life scenes just does not seem doable within 5400 words . in spots of the story , such as the beginning and the tube station scenes , your writing is very clear and enjoyable . i just felt the pacing was too fast .there used to be a park here ,  i thought . i  d passed by this corner a hundred times but never really paid much attention to it . i was always on my phone , or listening to music , or just eager to get home from work . i was dimly aware that there used to be grass , and some trees , and a big black chainlink fence right ? as i stared up at the building that had appeared in its place , i wasn  t so sure any more . newline newline the building itself had certainly never been there . i damn sure would have noticed . in between a standard brick office building and a little corner deli , it was remarkably out of place . i  m no expert on architecture but even i knew that there was something wrong here . it had an oniontopped dome like something straight out of russia , a roof thatched with some kind of tropical palm fronds , romanstyle columns , and gigantic sandstone obelisks that would have been in home in front of the pyramids . it looked like someone had taken an encyclopedia of world cultures and just threw it in a blender . newline newline  hey , man.  i stopped another pedestrian and managed to pull his nose out of the newspaper .  you know what this building is ?  newline newline he glanced over at it , but his eyes didn  t seem to notice the asianstyle paper walls , nor did they settle on the menacing dragon statue at the very top of the stairs . instead , he just gave me a confused look and then went back to reading about the local mayoral race on page b10 . i tried it with a few other people on the street . the best explanation that i got for the purpose of the building was  leave me alone , creep  from a lovely young woman out on a jog . newline newline i placed one foot on the marble steps . they felt real , at least . part of me was still pretty sure that this was an unexpected drug trip  maybe one of my roommates had laced my coffee with something . i ran my hand over the dragon , noticing that it was warm to the touch . certainly didn  t feel like i was tripping . i grabbed one of the doorknobs and gave it a little push , and it swung open with a groan . newline newline the first thing i noticed was that the inside was just too big . it had looked pretty large from outside  at least five or six stories . but the echoing , cavernous entry chamber was at least ten stories tall at a minimum . pillars of sunlight came streaming in through gaping windows that certainly hadn  t been there on the outside . the vast silence reminded me of cathedrals i  d visited in spain last summer . but instead of little niches full of saints  knucklebones or something , every alcove here had a different weapon in it . newline newline  excalibur ,  i read from the placard next to the nearest one .  reserved for british heroes . grants supreme executive power derived from a farcical aquatic ceremony . does critical damage against dragons and the french.  i tried to pick it up , but it was held tight by the stone base . was this some kind of joke ? newline newline i kept moving . if i was going to be tripping balls all day and wandering through this imaginary museum , i might as well enjoy it . further down , i found mjolnir , hammer of the norse gods . i tried to pick it up , but that was useless too . whoever had come up with this place at least paid attention to authenticity . and this museum didn  t just have weapons . the sign near the shield of perseus claimed that anyone who looked directly at it would still turn to stone  thank god that the reflective part was not facing forward . there was the sling that had killed goliath , as well as the trumpet that brought down the walls of jericho . newline newline right as i was about to blow on it , i heard a whisper . not loud , but in the vast silence of the hall it didn  t need to be . i placed the trumpet back onto its shelf and looked around , expecting to see whoever had spoken . still no one . but i could still hear it from somewhere in the far back of the hall . it was almost loud enough for me to understand , but not quite . newline newline the further i followed the whisper , the dustier the artifacts grew . i didn  t recognize the names of these at all  some of them didn  t even have names in any alphabet i could recognize . one of them wasn  t even a weapon  just a jaw bone with dried blood on it . everything was caked in dust , but i ignored all that . the whispering was almost a shout now , but i still couldn  t understand what it was saying . newline newline then i finally reached an alcove at the very back , and the whispering stopped . on a pedestal , there was a simple bow and arrow that looked like something a ten year old would make in his back yard with twine and a stick . i wiped one hand across the dusty placard to see the description . newline newline  this is for you . take it  you  ll know what to do . newline newline no mention of any powers or anything like that . for me ? or just anyone who came here ? newline newline could be for me , though , i decided . i reached forward and grabbed the bow , and the whole museum vanished around me . i found myself standing in a park  the very same park that i  d thought had been here the whole time . a dog chased a tennis ball past me , and two middle aged women shot me curious looks as they strolled past . the only reminder of my strange little adventure was the bow and arrow in my hand . newline newline you  ll know what to do , the card had said . i tried to figure out what that meant , but realized that i was having a hard time thinking because of the sirens blaring in the background . not one or two , but a whole fleet of police cars and fire trucks , coming closer and closer . i looked up from the bow and tried to see smoke on the horizon . instead , i saw some sort of creature rising up over the trees with a police car in its hand like it was just a child s toy . it tossed the car , which went sailing overhead and crashlanded somewhere in the neighborhood . newline newline in my hand , the bow began to grow warm . newlinethere was a bullet left for what was now the last man left living , but he was too afraid to commit the act of self termination . the three bodies , of what were the last of the dead , lie on the floor of an old lighthouse overlooking a beautiful ocean view . thomas was now more alone than any other human being could dream of , if there were humans anymore that is . no matter how far he walked or crawled he would find no one . still , even faced with this cruel fate , he soldiered on to find some way to survive on his own . for years he wandered , a nomad doomed to walk alone . thomas found himself never speaking , which was what he missed the most . a simple conversation would do wonders , but oh , what he would nt do to hear a laugh . a beautiful laugh , in a bleak humanless world . thomas  thoughts of what he would never again see or hear or feel weighed heavily on the poor man . eventually thomas  mind began to slip , wandering as much as his feet did . all he thought of was how hollow he had become , the world was once so beautiful and full of life . but he recalled the great spread of disease that would wipe humanity out in a matter of years . thomas found himself hating the planet itself for its creation of such a devastating plague . but he was too afraid of what awaited him on the other side of life to leave the earth behind ... newline  newline it had been years since bethany , gill , and jake had shot themselves in the old lighthouse . thomas was haggard , and worn , with calloused feet and hands . his skin as leather and rawhide , deep wrinkles serrated his face . his hair had steadily gone from a deep black to a gentle white . in spite of his appearance however , his mind was immune to times changes . thomas was tired of living , tired of existing for no purpose . all he desired was a rest , just to sit for while , and so he did . thomas propped himself against an old tree during the night , beneath the stars . closing his eyes he let his mind wander , and so it did . slowly , as he listened to the world around him , out of the glorious silence , thomas had a revelation , the world is more beautiful now than it ever was with people . humans claiming bits and pieces as if they had a right , subjugating their coinhabitants for ease of slaughter , destroying jungles to build concrete ones . but for all of that , still he would wish it all back if he could . that is the real tragedy , he thought , that he would have all of the wrongs people did return so long as he could hear a gentle laugh once more . was that selfish ? maybe it was , he thought . thomas wanted to laugh , to hear it once again before he ceased ... so he did , the last man on earth laughed . it was not because he thought all that had happened was funny , but rather because in his thoughts he imagined laughter , and that was enough a reason for thomas . the last man felt his heartbeat wane and his breathing slow , he wanted to become like the world he wandered on for so long . so he did , now thomas is as the world should always be , quiet , still , and peaceful . newline newline edit : i included a recurrence of his desire to hear laughter in the last passages . credit goes to mistermolondo for the criticism .the large aquatic beast grips the ball tighter , it peering at the boy and his dog below with deep black orb like eyes . newline newline  whano , that  s my ball !  the boy yells up at the creature with sharp confidence . newline timtom , the boy  s dog , lets out a couple yaps at the scaly creature . the creature slowly cocks his head to the dog and lets out a gurgling roar , its force hitting them like a gust . timtom runs behind the boy in fear and lets out the tiniest of barks in defiance . the creature slowly shakes his head pulling the ball into his chest . newline newline  yes , yes it is . it just bounced over here a moment ago ,  the boy explained unfaltering . newline the creature began to churn , its long tail whipping in the air behind it . it lifts its free hand from the lakes water sending a mist into the boy  s face . the creature points to itself as if to say it the ball belonged to it all along . newline the boy crosses his arms and stomps his foot in frustration . suddenly the boy gets an idea and a smirk appears on his face . he runs behind him and grabs a water reed and runs back up to the now curious beast . newline newline  timetom , wan na play boy ?  the boy says waving the reed high in the air . newline newline timtom begins to jump around excitedly his eyes locked on the reed . the boy tosses the reed into the air and the creatures eyes follow it as it flips and flips . timtom jumps into the air and grabs it between his teeth in a clean catch . newline newline  that was fun ,  the boy says ,  how about i catch that ,  he says pointing at the ball in the creature  s tight grip . newline the creature looks to the ball and back at the boy . the creature flicks the ball which rockets to the boy . the boy catches the ball which sends him skidding back onto the grass on his butt . newline newline the creature tilts its head and what looks like a smile stretches across its mouth . the boy gets up wiping himself off . newline newline  is that it , you just wanted to play ?  the boy ask . newline newline the creature nods . newline newline  well that  s ok ! you didn  t have to liewe can share it , you just have to ask.  newline newline the creature blinks at the boy but it seems to understand . newline newline  okay timtom , jump !  the boy says dashing forward . newline newline the boy jumps into the lake with sending a splash into the air . timtom stalls a bit but runs and jumps in after his friend . the boy tosses the ball at the creature who catches it in its mouth . timtom isn  t the only one that has tricks apparently . newline newlineit s a normal thursday night so naturally that special time comes around . you know what i m talking about . doing that thing . taking care of that fickle shit . so when i get all settled in to finish up some unfinished business i have the most brilliant idea . what if i could draw my own porn ? i ve thought about this before but did nt really feel like putting in the effort , but with my neural interface i can give it a go . newline newline neural interfaces are cheaper than they used to be , but a new one is still way out of my price range . luckily i won mine in a police auction . a robber got shot in the head but his implants were mostly undamaged so they were auctioned off along with his guns and getaway car . fun stuff . anyway , since the guy was a criminal his implants are unlocked so i can load up any application i want without paying for it . take that dmca . newline newline getting down to business , i scour forums for the most recommended art program and how to draw manga comes up a lot . it ca nt be too bad , but the only place i can find a download is on a sketchy looking russian site . seems good . i use my computer to download the program since the fiber connection is faster than whatever garbage wireless these implants have . when it finishes i see it s an executable so all i have to do is jack in and double click . the readme said that i should be able to draw as soon as the transfer finishes , but i still have some reservations since this could be a trojan . oh well let s click it . newline newline after a couple seconds the transfer is done and seems to be relatively successful . i say relatively because the files transferred correctly and are functional , but these drawings suck . they suck ass . do nt get me wrong , they re better than what i could do before but i could have gone to deviant art for this in all honesty . i have a couple of tits on the page in front of me . it s still better than nothing though . matter of fact , i m gon na hop offline for a bit . newlinethe stethoscope clattered to the floor as jillian brushed the doctor , storming out of the room . newline newline  sorry . i ll just ...  brian said rushing after her . newline newline  it s only to be expected ,  said the bald man that sat in a meditative pose on the hard floor . the doctor had introduced him as a practitioner of an alternative form of healing . he had almost said medicine . the bald man simply said his name , ahimsa , and bowed . newline newline jillian had only to glance at his barefeet and selfsewn robes before glaring incredulously at the doctor and stomping for the door . she had nt stopped at brian s calls and pulled away with deliberate steps as he reached for her . finally , as she went for the door to the stairs , he jumped in front of her grabbing her shoulders . newline newline  hey , what s the problem , kid ,  said a man walking toward them and rolling up his sleeves .  how bout you keep your hands on your dick and off her .  newline newline  dude , who the fuck are you ? !  brian whipped around looking up and meeting his eyes . newline newline  brian ,  jillian said now grabbing his shoulder as he pulled away . newline newline  is there something you want ?  brian asked stepping into the man . newline newline  i want ,  he answered trying to stand ground ,  you to keep your hands off your lady .  newline newline  brian !  jillian cried .  why right now ? why the fuck right now ?  he could hear the strain in her voice .  look ,  she said to the man ,  you re very sweet , but he s my brother .  she pried them apart at the chest and stood next to brian .  see ?  newline newline comparing their eyes , brows , and cheekbones , the man s expression lightened and spread into a smile .  oh ,  he said cheerily ,  i fight with my sisters , too .  newline newline  it s a fucking small world after all ,  brian muttered unclenching his fists . newline newline  thank you , though ,  jillian smiled at the man before dragging brian into the stairwell . newline newline  you should have waited . told him while his blood was clotting ,  he said as the door closed . newline newline  yes , brian ,  she sat on the stairs ,  and have a sister in a coma and a brother in jail .  newline newline brian sat down next to her . newline newline  i m sorry ,  he said softly . newline newline  meh ,  leaning against him .  i think i needed the distraction .  newline newline brian smiled . newline newline back in the room , ahimsa was explaining the mechanics of karma to the doctor who kept checking his watch and glancing at the doorway . he had pulled up a chair next to the crosslegged adept and pretended to scribble away on a chart . newline newline  with this one ,  ahimsa continued nodding toward the girl on the bed ,  i sense that this sleep has been brought on by unresolved karma . her soul wishes to do work in the fourth dimension and can better amass its energy without the distractions of earthly life .  newline newline the doctor stole a sideways glance at him before looking at the door , his watch , then back at his paper . newline newline  yes ,  ahimsa said closing his eyes .  i can see figures . next dimensional figures , mind you . they are still dim , but i can see them from all angles .  newline newline  something s certainly dim ,  the doctor thought . he had misread the twins . newline as the medical approach to comatose patients ended at keeping them alive , he had found that spiritually inclined relatives drew tenuous peace from the presence of proclaimed spiritual adepts . jillian s dreadlocks and the persistent smell of weed on brian made the doctor forgo the usual priests and rabbis in favor of someone more esoteric . jillian s reaction proved him mistaken . he glanced back toward the empty doorway . newline newline jillian used her sleeves to wipe the drying tears . newline newline  brian , the man was nt wearing any shoes ,  she said . newline newline  half of your friends think shoes are optional .  newline newline  i want my weed dealer barefoot ,  she said .  i want my doctor in savile row leathers .  newline newline  i m pretty sure dude is nt a doctor ,  he laughed . newline newline jillian threw up her hands in emphatic agreement .  do you see my problem ?  she laughed clapping the last three syllables . newline newline  of course , i do ,  brian said .  let s just go tell the doctor . the one that can tie his shoes .  newline newline  ah !  the doctor jumped up as they walked through the door . brian nodded to him while jillian s eyes immediately fell on ahimsa . newline eyes closed , he exhaled loudly then began slowly and silently drawing breath again . newline newline  i ve asked him to leave ,  the doctor said with guilty eyes .  i m waiting for security , now .  newline newline  why d you ask him here ?  jillian asked dryly . newline newline  i thought ...  the doctor began before trailing off . newline newline  uh ,  brian said staring at ahimsa . newline newline still deep in meditation , blood had begun to trickle from his nose . the doctor started toward him , but before his first step the girl on the bed let out a scream . all four jumped and her siblings rushed to her bed . they tried to convince her to lie back down as she was sitting up , panting , and frantically surveying the room . her eyes fell on the bald man . for less than a second , her soul struck a glowering , burning black look at him . newline the flash was replaced with confusion as the girl s siblings dispelled her disorientation with inviting voices and gentle laughter . newline newline ahimsa stood , holding his nose , and smiled at the doctor .  i guess the light is nt as dim as you thought ,  he said . newline newline  i heal ,  the doctor answered trying to remember if he had said that aloud ,  i m willing to use someone s fantasies to do it .  newline newline newline newlinetom laughed and played all winter day , newline

newline newline the avatar looked down and back up  haven  t thought about it until they started getting bruised . it  s also scraping the leather.  newline newline nina nodded in sympathy .  look , i  m sorry . i didn  t realize you were sentient . you should have told me sooner . i would entirely let you head back to the tavern , get drunk and probably try your shot at picking up that hot bartender.  newline newline the avatar considered for a moment , then scraped the tip of her boot through the soil at her feet .  do you mind if i go for the waitress instead ? i think she was into the leather thing . i might just keep them for her.  newline newline nina nodded .  entirely . climb her instead of the wall . i  ll consider it an achievement off the books . i  ll leave this one undone and you can dothat  s not going anywhere respectful.  newline newline the avatar laughed .  look , you seem a fairly decent sort of person except for the fact that you are thoroughly incompetent.  newline newline nina twisted her lips slightly  true . i  m sorry you  re stuck with me , but i can make it up to you . i  ll just leave the game running and you can go do whatever thekrelnam you want to do.  newline newline the avatar looked comically hopeful . she wasn  t programmed for hope either , nina thought . so sad . newline newline the avatar  s lips almost trembled .  i would appreciate that . not being , then being , then not being before and then being later is very strange.  newline newline nina nodded solemnly  i save and restore a lot . it  s not fair to the time line.  newline newline the avatar had clearly no idea what she was talking about , but wanted to not piss off the child god with the strangeeverything .  as you say . i need a bath and some sleep and i know where to get it . i  ll retire to the tavern and let my breasts heal up a mite before attempting the waitress quest.  newline newline nina agreed solemnly to the plan .  look , i know some cheats and codes , i can get you a bunch of gold . go wild.  newline newline the avatar took the promise at face value . what else could she do if child god was in such a giving mood .  one request.  newline newline nina attended  yes ?  newline newline the avatar said suspiciously  when i attempt waitress quest , could you be elsewhere ?  newline newline nina reassured her immediately  oh , absolutely , i promise . volume down , too.  newline newline the avatar looked reassured .  excellent . when i ambetter able to be gracious , we can speak again.  newline newline nina smiled and really hoped that her computer didn  t crash any time soon , for her avatar  s sake .  you got it . i promise i  ll knock before barging in on you . i wish you more comfortable clothes and a more comfortable life and a happy ending , things you were not going to get from me.  newline newline the avatar turned and walked the long road back to the tavern . newline newline nina minimized the window and thought for the thousandth time that gaming took her weird places and went to go get a sandwich . newlinei approached the structure with hesitation , not knowing it  s purpose or contents , but needing a place to rest . standing alone in the flat nothingness of an empty desert , the tower seemed the only destination possible . newline newline with no memory of how i came to be in this place , my journey of many days seemed fated to end at this place . for better or worse . newline newline the door to the tower opened without a knock . a soft voice called to me . newline newline  enter , traveler . your journey ends here.  newline newline the tower was many levels and i was instructed to climb a rounding staircase . at each new level i was presented with images of my life . i relived all my moments of joy , happiness , shame , regret , and remorse . newline newline when i finally reached the top i encountered two doors standing side by side . newline newline  what is this place ?  i cried out . newline newline the soft voice answered ,  traveler , we each have our own desert tower . a beacon on an empty canvas to highlight our faults and glories . through this labyrinth , magnifying our lives , we are judged.  newline newline one door opened , and i prepared to accept my fate . as i entered the darkness of the new room i succumbed to the strangest sensation of warmth and comfort . newline newline  welcome ,  the voice whispered ,  you are home . time must be up . newline newline i wake up to crusty , swollen eyes again . i look for my slippers and untangle myself from my sheets . my eye catches the duct tape on my floor . i follow its perfect box shape like i do everytime i wake up . it sits in front of my doorway , mocking me and my increased isolationism . newline newline a sharp smell distracts me from the sight and i wrinkle my nose . once again i smell like hospital . clean and cold and blank . it takes a few minutes to get my feet in the slippers , the thick padding soothes my nerves as i stand up . i grab my robe and struggle to put it on . the smell stings my nose and i give up . newline newline naked i shuffle into the bathroom and blink myopically at the brightness . then i remember that i wear glasses . they sit where they always do , next to the sink . i reach out and tsk at the imperfections on the frames . i blink in confusion . newline newline how can i see this ? newline newline am i wearing contacts ? newline newline puzzled i stare deeply in the mirror . i deliberately ignore the lack of aging in my hands . robotically my fingers poke at my eyeball . newline newline no contacts . newline newline somewhere deep inside i start screaming as my hand falls to my side . i take several deep breaths , then turn on the water to maximum heat . i pour in some of the new bath oils i found online , then climb in . soothing melodic dream or something like that . i sit in the tub , letting my skin grow redder and redder . i gift myself in a few short suicidal daydreams before pulling out the stopper and letting the water drain out around me . newline newline i ca nt help but notice the flashes of dull metal in my reddened skin . newline newline i try not to think about it as i dry myself off . i avoid looking at myself in the mirror as if that will keep the screaming down . newline newline steam continues to waft from my skin as i walk to the computer . i smile as it greets me with musical tones . it took forever to get it to stop talking . i limited it to something i heard a long time ago , in a movie about robots and space . newline newline i hope reddit will be interesting tonight . i only have 6 hours before i have to stand in my duct tape square again . newline newline i wonder what will be swollen tomorrow ? newline newline oh ! cat pics , how cute ! newline newlinelet me get this out of the way : if you have nt figured it out yet , humans have more than five senses . now , i m not here to list them all to you . that s a job for the neuroscientists . i can tell you that no matter how much you wax philosophical , love is not one of them . newline newline the heat of the sun is not the warmth you felt in their smile . the vibrations of a guitar is not your wavelength as it matched theirs . the pull you feel to the core of the world is not what made them seem like yours . you regaining your footing is not the balance you felt in them . the pain in your heart was nothing compared to their final moments . newline newline it does nt matter . none of it does . it all distracts you from what s really there . i started with the trivial five ... newline newline          newline newline cogito ergo sum ,  i was reminded . the one incontrovertible truth i could be sure of in a world of lies . a moment later , i was nt . newline newline after an unknowable length of time , the nothing became everything . newline newline          newline newline my first prompt in months . a bit on the edgy side , but it was fun to write . the noise was incessant . a buzz in my ears . i closed my eyes and opened them , listening to the droning electric sound of my kid crackling through the speaker . a pale blue light lit up the room a moment , then changed to red then back to blue . repeating the pattern over and over as the neon sign across the street advertised it s wares . live nude girls .  no cover charge .  it was a piss poor excuse for a strip club , miles from the vegas strip . it was a place where old strippers came to die , figuratively . newline newline  shut up , kid .  i muttered , rubbing the sleep from my eyes . my five day growth of beard rasped like a wire brush beneath my hand . i kicked and rolled , trying to turn myself and after three attempts , i managed to sit up . my head felt like it was splitting , like gravity had taken a fresh hold on it was trying to pull the skin from my weary sleepwollen face like extra cheese sliding off a pizza . newline newline   it s alright kid . i m going to take you away from here .   newline newline the sound of that voice over the baby monitor was better than red bull and coffe . i came awake in that moment . my swollen ankles supporting me , even though my feet hurt with each step . i grabbed the .38 off my night stand , and hurried down the hall . my feet punching the hardwood floor with each step . knickknacks bounced from shelves , book cases swayed back and forth , slapping the wall as the weakened floor gave way a little with each ponderous stride i took . newline newline i hit the nursery door with my shoulder , blowing it apart . i was heavy and obese and out of shape , but in my day , i was force to be reckoned with . i slapped the door aside and raised the snubnosed .38 , pointing the silver barrel at the head of the intruder . she fell back against the crib , the baby held to her breast . newline newline i could read part of the sign across the street through my daughter s window . newline newline  put sophie down ,  i roared . i was alive in that moment . i was aware of my dry oily skin , my greasy hair , the stench of my own body . i smacked my lips a couple times to do away with the metallic taste in my mouth , alternating between sucking my bottom and top to wet them . newline newline the woman gave no indication that she would obey my command .  put the kid down , or i m going to shoot you in your motherfucking face . put her down !  newline newline she was afraid . her eyes darted left and right , looking for escape , but there was nt any . we were on the second floor in an apartment above a bar , and the only way out was through me . newline newline  she s not your child ,  the woman said , turning to set sophie down .  newline newline  say that again ,  i snarled , thumbing back the hammer . newline newline  she s not your child , and you know it . she has a father and he wants her back .  the woman told me calmly . she was exagerating the slowness of her motions , trying to diffuse the situation . newline newline  you re right about that . she does have a father . me . who the fuck are you ?  i croaked , swallowing . my mouth was so fucking dry . i needed another beer . newline newline  victoria smiles . i m a private investigator . i was hired by sophie s real father to find her and bring her home .  she said , slowly sidling toward the middle of the room . the glare from the sign across the street was like needles being stuck into my brain . she blocked out the light with her body and i sighed with relief . newline newline  so , you admit you re here to steal my daughter ?  the gun was shaking in my hand . i needed a fix . it d been hours since my last .  i should blow your fucking face off right now . i d be well within my rights . cops come by , scoop up your body , and congratulate me for protecting my family .  newline newline  what are you going to do , victor ? kill me ? you caught me . you win . i ll go back and tell sophie s dad i failed . there s no need to make this bloody . i was hired to do a job . i sure as hell do nt want to die doing that job .  the detective crooned .  i do nt know why you took sophie , and i do nt care . i m sure you had your reasons . i just want to get out of here . i just want to go .  i could see the desperation in her face , but not her eyes . she was nt scared , not really . newline newline  i did nt steal her . i was married to her mother . she was two weeks preganant when we met , was nt even showing then . i loved her , but she did nt survive the pregnancy . died up there in the hospital giving birth to my little girl , to my sophie . she picked out the name before she died .  i felt the tears wetting my eyes , blurring the neon like a kaleidoscope .  i really loved her .  newline newline  i know you did , big guy . but , sophie s real father would like her back . it s the law .  victoria whispered cooly , turning to look out the window . newline newline  you wo nt make it out that window ,  i promised , wiping my eyes with the back of my hand . newline newline  oh , i m not going out the window , victor .  she pulled her gun faster than i could follow and stepped out from in front of the window . the light stabbed into my eyes , blinding me even as her nine millimeter coughed . the pain was horrible , burning through my side . i managed to squeeze off a couple of shots before she could disarm me . newline newline the detective took my .38 , kicking me in the face for good measure . it would take more than a kick from her tiny frame to put me under . i held on , spitting out blood and tried crawling to my feet . newline newline  stay down , dammit .  victoria spat , stepping back . i slapped a hand over the hole in my side , but stopped rising . the room was silent . victoria had both guns pointed at my chest .  i will kill you .  she warned , but i did nt care . the room was silent . newline newline i put my hand on the door knob and rose to my feet . newline newline  dammit . do nt make me kill you .  she cried , stepping back further . newline newline  oh , you re going to have to kill me .  i promised , tears spilling from my bloodshot eyes . i took an unsteady step toward the crib . i heard the click of the hammer on my .38 being drawn back because the room was silent . newline newline  stay away from her ,  victoria warned moving closer to the window . newline newline  how are you going to explain this ?  i asked . newline newline  you attacked me .  she said , shrugging .  i defended myself .  newline newline  yeah . but , how are you going to explain this ,  i asked , pointing toward the crib . she did nt say anything at first , perhaps she found the silence too much .  you can shoot me now .  newline newline she did nt say a word . she just looked at the crib in horror . i could see it in her face . it was the face of someone who realized they d screwed up . i grabbed the baby monitor and turned it off , flinging at the detective s head . she ducked beneath it , but it was never meant to hit her . i plowed into her a moment later , blasting her out the window . she caught the edge of the awning below and flipped over , landing on the sidewalk head first . i could hear the sickening sound of her neck snapping . no big feat that . after all , the room was silent .the key to my success has always been planning . i choose my victims months in advance , and work around the clock . maps of their common haunts , and schedules showing where the victim will be at any given time . charts of friends and family . details of her job and boss and coworkers . even her dirty secrets , discovered through keyloggers and blackmailing friends . and once i know her better than her own husband  i always choose married women  , then i begin to plot the kill . i begin to get close to the victim , worming my way into her life . making her obsessed with me . newline newline and it works , every time . the box on my shelf rattles with twenty three wedding rings . a monument to planning for every possible contingency . and most importantly , planning to get caught . most serial killers never expect it to happen . they re consumed by their hubris . they think they re special . they are the ones who will get away with it . fools . newline newline march 14 , 2014 : the day i was found . i was waiting in bed , unable to sleep . i heard the light patter of footsteps on my deck from tiptoeing black boots . i could barely contain my glee . the windows exploded inward , spraying shards of glass all over my perfectly clean apartment . the door to my bedroom splintered and buckled under the force of the battering ram . i was calmly sitting against my headboard with a pleasant smile and my hands clasped behind my head . the swat members looked a bit unnerved , and slapped the cuffs on me . they roughed me up a bit , and i squealed in pain as they expected . not that i actually care  this will only help my defense . newline newline i sat in court , watching the forensics investigators explain all of the evidence gathered from my home . the books that i d published , full of eerily similar details that correspond to the killings . the maps and charts that i had prepared with facts that only the killer would know . the long unexplained travel absences . my journal , full of confessions about the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction that comes with a successful kill . the knives , stained with dried human blood . they called me to the stand , of course , but i pleaded the fifth . newline newline and then ... the case began to fall apart . it s all part of being a fiction writer , my defense attorney explained . all research for my next work , which is entered into evidence . a first person perspective of a serial killer . completely fictionalized , of course . the charts and maps were found to have grievous errors that the actual killer would not have made , including where the victim might be on the night of the murders . the charts had similar inaccurate details . my defense attorney explained that i did my best to piece the crimes together from news stories and a friend within the police department . poor jacob ... his name was dragged through the mud and his career ruined , but he ended up corroborating my story . he was a necessary sacrifice . the journals were simply fictional , and contained no details about the actual cases . newline newline the knives were my coup de grce . what a sloppy killer i was , to leave physical evidence on the blades ! if only i d scrubbed harder ! it s what the prosecutor called a  smoking gun .  she took great pleasure in waving the weapon around the courtroom , detailing how i had sliced open the victim mercilessly . then it was my turn . my attorney brought in the key surprise witness : a morgue employee that i had bribed . he let me in late one night to practice on an unnamed jane doe . i d told him i was an author , and that i was interested in being able to vividly describe the sound and feel of a knife cutting into flesh . and it was the truth . i never lie . it s not quite the same when they re dead , but i enjoyed this bit of alibi building nonetheless . newline newline i still remember the prosecutor s face after his testimony . she had nothing on crossexamination , and she could see her career going down the tubes . this was the most publicized trial the city had had in years , and she was completely blowing it . i wondered if she d get fired for this . if not , i d have to pull a few more strings . i gave her a sympathetic head nod and a barelyconcealed smirk , and she could nt hide the smoldering anger . newline newline after the acquittal , we shook hands in front of a hundred flashing cameras . she put on her fakest smile and declared that justice had been served . she clenched my hand tighter and for a brief moment let the mask drop  she looked like she wanted to gag . with a wave to the reporters , she whispered into my ear :  i know you did it . and i m going to stop you .  newline newline i continued shaking her right hand , eying the soft gold wedding ring on the other and picturing it in my collection .  you ll try ,  i told her .  looking forward to seeing you again soon .  i really , really was .the fortnight newline newline tyler looked at the clock . his students all yearning for the same thing as he , he continued making notes on the paper before him . the room was silent . the ticking was exponentially noisier . brian scratched an answer in his test and made the wanted correction . sara drummed her lips on her paper . claire was sweating from the apparent lack of studying she had been overtly complaining about . tyler looked again at the clock . newline newline his plans for the fortnight were very certain . he had been planning them since february . his partner clifton and he had decided the rent a cabin out near pantor city . it was a nice cabin , built for fortnight purposes . the main landing was clear of any large furniture , yet comforting and inviting all the same . he had taken images of it with his cell phone and begun sharing them with the women in the school for a few weeks now . clifton had advised against thatit would be difficult to gain a proper understanding of how the women would react to a place like that until the fortnight . claire shifted in her seat uncomfortably . jordan looked around the room with concern . newline newline tyler knew that there would be plenty of time to get feedback from the cabin this year . last year , he and clifton had rented a place in the city , which was much capable of providing insight into the thoughts of the women he brought there . since their homes were much closer , the women were not very intent on staying , even with the safety concerns that had begun to crop up lately . newline newline tyler had already confiscated several hormonhancers from several of the boys in the past few days . some of them had begun to excrete already , but until the ladies began there was little worry . the problem was their attitudes . tyler had long been able to handle himself better than most . he hadin his pastsaved many women of their pursuers . newline newline they had thanked him generously of course , coming to the city with him and providing the wild beating that tyler craved . he never really did what he did often without the hint in the back of his mind that he would be rewarded for his efforts . newline newline jordan came to his desk and slid the papers into the black box , slinging his bag over his shoulder and escaping the room . tyler heard an excited  whoop !  as jordan left the room . jordan was not one that tyler worried about . young men always had an uncertainness in their first fortnight , it was one reason why tyler was giving instruction to the students . picking up his test , tyler examined the results . the remarks were as expected . newline 1 . were the men allowed to pick up any interested woman to mate ? yes , provided that the woman is giving off the appropriate signals . newline 2 . what are the limitations of the female  s sex drive ? there are none , they are capable of intense strength and tenacity when they find a mate capable of providing the sex she needs . newline 3 . what is your opinion of the laws  or lack thereof  regarding firstfortnight hormonhancers ? with the desperation of some countries for more issues in the areas of a woman  s safety and a man  s longevity , hormonhancers , regardless of for firstfortnight participants or not , have many benefits to each in their thirst during the fortnight . newline newline tyler read through the rest of his paper with satisfaction . with respect to his answer on hormonhancers  he disagreed with jordan  s inability to remember that each male  s firstfortnight was something of a hazard to the women around him  tyler was happy with his responses . newline newline there was a light tapping of glass behind him . turning in his seat , tyler saw clifton behind him . what is he doing here ? he  s a few hours early ! newline newline seeing several of his students look up , tyler put a hand out to them as he stood .  continue working , i  ll be able to tell if you aren  t . you still haveten minutes before the bell ,  he said taking a quick glance at the clock as he pulled the door closed . he saw the sweating claire put one hand on her temple as she made another scratch on her paper .  what are you doing here ? i can  t leave the school until each test has been handed over ,  he addressed to clifton . newline newline the other man could not have exhibited his excitement any clearer if he held a sign with lights flashing and pointing to his dick , which tyler could immediately tell was bulging and ready for clifton  s own fortnight rituals . newline newline  any good ones this year ?  clifton asked casually , ignoring tyler  s question and peering over his shoulder to look in the classroom . newline newline at least they  re all of age this year , he thought . not that he or clifton had had any problems like that in the past , tyler had held the lessons on rapemating with frustrating results . each year , more and more of the women had more and more disagreements regarding the rape culture of their hormones . as the women age , and they gain more control over their excretions , the possibilities open up regarding who they decide to mate with , often ignoring consent altogether . newline newline explaining the infamous story of her aunt , sara told how she visited the prison often and the other types of individuals that were locked up inside . bringing her nearly to tears , sara thenmost surprisinglyconcluded that it was not the fault of her aunt that she was locked up , but rather the fault of the boys who had invited her to the gathering in the first place . sara , still having not yet experienced her first fortnight event , had difficulty wrapping her head around the idea of control and the hormones at a woman  s disposal . newline newline tyler shook his head in feigned disappointment at his friend , grabbing the bulge in a complete disregard for the smell that had begun to permeate the doorway , courtesy of clifton .  listen ass , i  ll still have to examine the tests and deliver the results to the proctor . it  s going to be some time yet.  newline newline  well don  t keep me waiting , that cabin is growing more and more appealing with each passing minute ,  clifton needlessly explained , as tyler was beginning to feel the same . tyler was rarely early in his entering the fortnight , but he didn  t want anything to spur his thoughts just the same . newline newline he bid his friend goodbye and returned to the classroom . as he did so , seven other students stood and placed their papers in the bin and took their things out the door . newline newline tyler counted three males that had already begun their fortnight . the discomfort they attempted to disguise as they left the classroom was exceedingly humorous as the boys had no idea they were being as pellucid as they were . as always , the women walked out unhampered by any member , as the women all would begin to moisten at the same time the next day . newline newline tyler had explained that the mixture of food chemicals and body functions had enabled the men to come off the scheduled stage of time . since it had been recorded , women everywhere were still on the same two weeks as they had been . scientists had been researching the reason for this for decades with little in the way of results . men had the pleasure and discomfort of beginning several hours to a full day before the women of the fortnight would be ready . newline newline this was another lesson that tyler had attempted to explain to the best of his ability . several of the students seemed to have trouble remembering that there were no evident reasons for the unisexual premature readiness . while there were several reasons for each man being early , it showed no decline in performance or longevity . newline newline  eyes on your test please , boys ,  tyler announced , making several of the men jump in surprise . brian had begun to look around the classroom . with the distraction , it appeared to j.p. that he had cause to look around at other tests too . claire covered her answers . newline newline with a sigh , tyler stood up and began pacing the rows of the students . brian stood quickly and handed his test to tyler before rushing out of the room . tyler noticed the bulge in his pants and the line of sweat on his brow . newline newline another step farther , and tyler knew immediately why . he sat down on the side of a desk in the front row and looked at the remaining students .  i know that someone has activated a hormonhancer , it  s going to cost your results by quite a bit.  he let that sink in for a moment , examining the looks on their faces .  not to mention the distraction you  ve provided to your fellow classmates.  newline newline tyler looked as ingrid stood and placed the test in the bin . she strode out of the classroom when it hit tyler . newline newline that  s no hormonhancerthere  s a ready woman in here ! newline newline looking at the remaining women in the class , tyler had to think quickly . the fortnight , not scheduled for the women to moisten for another few hoursand even their secretions beginning only a short time after that , had specific rules that tyler knew . if one of the women here was truly ready newline newline the rules have changed . newline newline two of the boys in the class stood up , familiar bulges in their pants . one of them began to shift their bodies to allow for more room to their member . one of the girls let out a gasp of surprise , standing and dropping her pen on the floor . tyler pointed to the door as he clapped to the two boysnothe two men . if they were ready to mate they were men now . newline newline the class suddenly sounded with the scratches of chairs being pushed back and most of the women rushed out of the room . newline newline they would be followed . tyler watched them to see if they were showing the signs . newline newline they weren  t .sucking on a stale cigarette , black , oilslick coffee on the table in front of him . he blew out a cloud of smoke and turned the cup in front of him . pointing the handle at allison .  i know it s been a while since we talked .  newline newline she sighed and flipped that yellow hair over a shoulder , crossing her hands on the table and looking david straight in the eye .  a while ? you ve been avoiding talking for months . i ve waited and waited , david . you wake up screaming , you drink whenever you re not working , and all you do is piddle in that garage or brood in front of the tv . we have nt even made love since the first month you came home .  newline newline  woman , you have no idea what happened there . there s no way i can describe it to you in the due respect it deserves . it was gnarled and vile , but righteous and so.. i do nt know . real .  david dropped the cigarette in his coffee , and slid the cup away from him .  look , i know you waited . a year and a half . i m grateful . i just somehow this has all been a mistake .  newline newline she stared at her hands , the air sweet in her lungs . the trees in bloom and the birds singing . the roar of jets and engines as the post they lived on bustled with activity . the war raged on , wihtikow was ours.. he loved it . she knew it . watching shuttles day in and out from fleet to earth as he sat on this very patio , same to every house in this housing labyrinth . newline newline  and i love you , i love you all the more . it s just that i ve requested ranger school , i think i could help make a difference for our boys out there . and do nt nobody deserve to have to be waiting on any of that .  newline newline she breathed deep , and exhaled slow . a half shaken quality to it that bordered on rage , watching her fists ball .  is that what you want ? you gon na fuck and have kids with this monster we ve made ? is it gon na hold you when you cry ? keep you warm at night ? be your friend and partner ?  she was on her feet , and she d finally realized it . chair flat on it s back . her body lean and hard , that rage burning a bit brighter . newline newline  it s not like that . i hope one day we can meet up again , and maybe it ll work out , maybe it wo nt . i do know that getting married before i left was a mistake . one of my biggest . it was nt fair to either of us . no one should have to worry like you did . before i left , i thought i was finally living . life was good , even thought there was no way it could ever go wrong . then we landed at wihtikow , and i found out what living required . my god , i loved it . my greatest mistake was thinking that being alive was the same as living . we lived . we would nt have made it if it were nt for 4th ranger . they dropped in their pods and brought hell and fury with that gun ship . ol  crows did nt stand a chance . i knew right then where i wanted to be .  he sighed and looked up at her . newline newline as she watched those sad blue eyes stare into hers , she sank . beaten and bruised as she hung her head .  you do love it .  a soft whimper that hardened into resentment .  you re in love with this shrine to death . the games , the books , the movies and music . even that stupid dancing skeleton with that glass tattooed on your shoulder . my god . you re a grown man living out a twisted fantasy from childhood .  newline newline sliding back his chair and rising to his feet . he reached out and brushed hair away from her face . tucking it behind her ears in that familiar way . cupping her face in his hands , her face so long . it did nt suit her .  allison , i ll always love you , but i have to do this . there s no telling if i ll come back , how long i ll be gone or how often . you ca nt live like that , and i ca nt live with you chasing a ghost .  his throat tight , eyes welled . no , we ca nt have that . newline newline  i thought we were partners . we made decisions together .  she leaned into him , wrapping her arms around his waist , head barely reaching his chest . newline newline  we re so young still , and know one knows how deep this war will get . this war is for our very existence . you know they want us all dead . we ve got to take this planet .  it was the struggle that moved him . so vast , influencing the trillions of lives involved . as yet another shuttle , black as night ,

wholestone men right now . i am sure we will be surrounded by golems sooner or later . newline newline i think the nurses are coming back , i have to take my meds again . it s adaption , no , antirejection meds . i am starting to become curious as to why they lock the door every time they leave however ... that you joe ?  lori called from the kitchen . newline newline  yeah hon.  the creaking front door that betrayed me every time i came in late was about to be scratched from my todo list . there  s always a silver lining . i didn  t bother to shut it , didn  t feel the need to draw my shoulders toward my ears as though they would muffle the sound . instead , i just kept shuffling forward past my couch and past the door to the kitchen , until i reached mac  s room . i turned the knob slowly , lifting up on it as i pulled the door out , careful to open it without making a sound . newline newline the nightlight on the dresser cast shadows of dinosaurs on the walls . it spun so as to make the great beasts march in a constant parade of extinction . someday maybe , millions of years in the future on another world , there might be a man shaped shadow cast on the walls of another creature  s room . there could be stories told that would frighten yet captivate the children filling them with dreams of a world their brightest could only guess at . newline newline mac s breathing was the lone sound and from the cadence it was clear he had been asleep awhile . i didn  t need to worry about waking him , though the urge to rouse him pulled at me . a final smile from his innocent face seemed like the best possible image to end on . it wouldn  t be a fair trade though . i would take a smile , he would take fear and hysteria and maybe pain . better to let him sleep . i leaned into his crib and kissed his forehead and then turned and left the room pulling the door closed behind me . newline newline i paused then in the hallway . our bedroom to my right , lori was to my left fixing a late dinner for me . i had called her after to tell her i was on my way . she asked how it went and i said okay and she asked if she could reheat last night  s meatloaf and maybe a few veggies and i said that would be fine . now though , i really wanted to lie down , pull the pillow over my face and feign surprise so that i could share in the collective gasp of the world . newline newline i turned left and shuffled down the hallway into the kitchen . newline newline my chin went up , by habit , as soon as i crossed the threshold . the shoulders that graced a million tshirts went back thrusting my chest forward . lori looked up at me from the dishes she was scrubbing , pulled a wet hand from where it hid below the bubbles and wiped a lock of hair from her face . she left a trail of soap along her cheek so that it sparkled in the light . the corners of her eyes crinkled and she smiled . i smiled back and stepped up to her , moving behind her , forcing her back to her dishes . i wrapped my arms around her waist and kissed the back of her neck and she leaned into me and i squeezed a bit tighter and her hands froze . newline newline  everything okay ?  newline newline  hmm ?  newline newline  tonight , did everything go okay ?  her voice held concern but the tone was optimistic . newline newline  oh yeah , no problems , less to do than i expected actually.  the truth was there was nothing to do . futuro was long gone before we got there , his plan put in motion days ago . all the intel we had was old , planted and forged . he wanted us to find the leviathan at the last possible moment . what better way to punish us then to leave us with the thought that there was nothing we could do to stop it ? there was nothing more cruel than giving us these final moments with our families . it was never intended to be a mercy but rather a punishment . he was saying , look how close you were and know that you failed them just as you failed my people when we needed you . newline newline  how is tommy ?  she asked , her attention returned to the plates . newline newline  he  s good . sends his love and his apologies for keeping me so late.  the engineer , tommy , died as soon as we stepped into the building . it was all part of the plan . the engineer was the only one on our team that had even the faintest glimmer of hope at reversing what was happening . there was something about the design of the building and the machine that overwhelmed him as soon as he got near it . his knees buckled , hands bunched into the fists as he fell over . artemis was at his side in an instant but it was too late . she held him as he convulsed and shook until blood ran from his ears . then he was gone . newline newline we left him there . that hallway was as good a tomb as any now . newline newline  i  ll be sure to give him hell at the next game night.  she pulled the last cup from the water , rinsed it and put in the drying rack . i let go of her and turned to the fridge , pulled it open and grabbed a beer . newline newline  uh uhh , no way mister.  she reached to snatch it out of my hand so i turned away twisting the cap .  hey ! have you forgotten the rules ? it  s tuesday , no beer on weeknights !  newline newline  one isn  t going to kill me.  i protested , turning back around . i could argue that of this i was certain . newline newline  it  s a slippery slope though , the road to aa is paved with men that drink on tuesdays.  she leaned back into the counter , arching her back and rubbing her neck with her hand . newline newline  one beer does not an alcoholic make.  i took a long draw of it then . newline newline  i  m sure they all say that sooner or later.  newline newline  you  re probably right.  and another swig . newline newline  if you think you  re going to get drunk and frisky with me you  ve got another thing coming . i don  t sleep with bad boys that can  t follow the rules.  newline newline i smirked . newline newline  well , how about sleeping with a good man that only occasionally bends them.  i put my beer down and pulled her into my arms again . she looked up and our lips met and i squeezed a bit tighter and lifted her off the ground . her eyes shot open , widened  i could see her surprise at my strength and the ease with which i lifted her . newline newline she pulled back and said ,  how ?  newline newline the dishes rattled in the drying rack and i forced our mouths back together . newline newline newline newline i wrote a  first chapter  that explained who the characters were and more about the planet etc , but i do nt think i actually need it after writing the second part . so here is the second part of my story .  newline newline we were five minutes into the flight and had already seen our glimpse of the beautiful blue green oceans , the white sand shoreline and the golden green plains and i was getting nervous that mr. bartum  junior if you please  hadn  t said anything yet . newline newline  is there platinum in those mountains ahead ?  newline newline  yes , just as you ordered , and above it you will find the most interesting eco system . see the suckler plants actually require the wild  newline newline  of course of course . what about oil and natural gas ?  mr. bartum jr. asked . newline newline  well yes , i was able to use it with the magma layer of the planet to keep the oceans at the exact temperature year round  it has never been done before.  newline newline  but is there a lot of it ?  newline newline  yes , but it is at a crucial balance to maintain the systems of the planet . why do you ask ?  newline newline  so i know how much i can mine of course.  newline newline i wasn  t sure i had heard him right .  did you say  mine  ? as in dig up ?  newline newline  exactly . oh , that  s beautiful ! i love the way you have that giant river coming down off the mountain and heading towards the center of the continent.  newline newline finally , he was starting to see the natural wonder this planet was .  oh , well thank you . once those tributaries join in the foothills there , it becomes the deepest and widest freshwater river on any known planet.  newline newline  that  s just perfect . having that water source will make the strip mining so much easier.  bartum jr. said with a smile as he continued to stare out from the glass observation deck . newline newline  strip mine !  newline newline i heard my boss gasp and open his mouth but junior answered first .  yes , strip mine.  newline newline  this is the final master piece of my career ! why ? if you can afford to buy a deluxe edition planet , why would you need to mine for anything ?  newline newline  oh , daddy said i needed to learn responsibility or some such thing and put me on a fixed allowance . but he bought this for me as an 18th birthday gift . so of course i had it made with some extras he would never notice paying for.  junior was now staring at the planet with undisguised lust . newline newline i knew that his body guards would get to me in a split second , but i hated this guy with a passion and was already picturing myself choking his round little neck . newline newline as i launched myself at him i was surprised upon impact at how light he was . my tackle that was meant to take him to the ground instead took us both into the observation window , and to my great surprise , through it . as we plummeted to the planet below , i couldn  t help but reflect that it was a very suitable ending for both of us for completely opposite reasons . newlinethe final 4 , that was what their commander had called them . they had been orphans , raised from infancy under his watch , bred and trained to be his disciples . he watched over them , fed them , took care of them , even loved them . as far as the other units were concerned , there was no need for excessive and useless interactions between commanders and their disciples . he was different though . he understood that teaching them love and companionship gave them something to bleed deeper for . as they grew older , he christened them with the name final 4 . in every training exercise , in every mission , in every place where heroes were needed , they were always the final 4 left standing . and today , they were the final 4 left standing infront of their commander , as enemies . the government had explicitly avoided sending them on this mission because they did not trust their judgement to do what was necessary and bring the commander back dead or alive . that their emotions would prevail and he might slip through their fingers . with every other tactical group having been beaten down however , they had no choice ... the final 4 were called . the oldest , final terra , the oldest , called out to his commander , standing inside the confined space of the old ghanaian facility . he demanded to know if the allegations against his commander were true . the commander would not answer . final blaze , the youngest , was in a fury . he lurched forward and attacked him , not being able to land one hit as the commander constantly evaded them . final aqua and final thunder stood watching , until blaze was hit back into them and they caught him . screams of betrayal , screams of anger , of lost trust and faith filled the room . he took a deep breath . the commander took a step back and slumped into the wall behind them . sending them had defeated no part of him but his will to keep fighting . they were his children . that was when he told them . the leader of a rebel alliance in the ghanaian military was about to come into possession of a nuclear weapon , and with little to lose he was going to use it to initiate all out war , and use his forces amidst the chaos to gain control . the only way to stop him was to infiltrate his ranks , earn his trust , and be present at the transfer of the bomb to be able to stop him . his body was on the other side of the wall the commander told them . he had killed him after the coordinates to the bomb had been given . but now there was no going back . he was now publicly known as the number two of this organization , and to end the threat of this organization , it s members had to know that they had been completely beaten , not betrayed , lest some other member think himself worthy of taking over and resuming where their true leader had been gunned down . the commander stood up and readied himself . he and the final four knew what they had to do . blaze , terra , aqua and thunder , hardening their hearts , fought forward without holding back , to honor their commanders mission , and to show him that they were ready to continue his legacy . when they returned home , they told the government that his body had been lost in the jungles of africa , where in specific they did not know . the world coronated them as heroes , as defenders of the nation against their treacherous commander . upon return from the continent , they had taken his body to the private strip of land that the late commander had owned , having been given jointly to the final 4 in his will . once his body was within the flowers and the dirt , they stood endlessly staring at him . not being able to speak , for what words could encompass their love for their commander , not being able to cry , for how many rivers were enough to fill before the tragedy of his loss was over . the traitor to the world , the hero to his children . um . yeah ... if you could just get back on the computer and forget that this ever happened , honeybunches , that d be great . otherwise , uh ... well ...  the feminine , chirpy voice proceeded to make a kktch sound .  you re one of the more interesting kids , so please do nt make me come down there .  newline newline my heart was racing . if someone was monitoring me without my noticing , i had no doubts that they d be abe to kill me . i turned around and sat back down at the computer , staring at the monitor blankly . newline newline  oh , and do nt tell anyone about this , kay ? otherwise , the  kktch  will become a  sskkkrrrrriitch  and trust me , you do nt want that to happen .  newline newline i exited out of the browser and decided to play a game instead . newline newline  and before you ask , yes , we can see your internet activity . i have to say , for a teenage boy , you do nt seem to be looking at a lot of porn .  newline newline i wanted her to shut up . i was having a hard enough time dealing with my fate as it was . newline newline  be a good boy for mommy ! buhbye now !  newline newline i silently screamed every insult i had ever heard of to her . at least she was gone now . newline newline maybe i could pretend everything was normal for ... say ... a month . and then ... newline newline probably kktch .  bless you   newline part 2 newline newline  newline newline newline  so i guess i m just supposed to let you do what you want , is that it ?  shouted sarah in a rage as she ran her fingers through her hair .  i m just supposed to understand ?  newline newline earl staggered slightly , his mind in a heavy state of intoxication and his abilities to reply or even stand up straight being put to the test . newline newline  you come home drunk after hanging out with that slut secretary for three hours without returning my calls or texts ? that s it , i m done with you . i m done with all of this . we both made a promise to be faithful to each other , and if you ca nt even manage to give me a straight answer then i need you to leave right now !  newline newline  wait ,  said earl as he placed his hands on the back of the chair in front of him , his head spinning with the taste of vodka and lipstick on his tongue .  just listen to me ...  newline newline  listen to you what ? i ve never seen you this drunk before ! night after night you flake out on me and it s one thing after another . if you need to work late , i understand . but when i see our car parked outside of the bar ? you lied to me , earl , and it has nt been the first time . if i ca nt even trust you , how am i supposed to love you ? how are you supposed to love me ?  newline newline  i made a mistake ,  said earl as he churned his fingers against the wooden seat .  i made a mistake , sarah , and i m sorry . please do nt do this .  newline newline  that s what you said last time , and the time before that !  she shouted from the other end of the dining room counter .  i gave you a fair shot , earl , and you blew it . three strikes . you re out !  she pointed to the front door of their apartment . newline newline earl released the chair from his grip and slowly turned toward the entrance , his necktie undone and dangling from his neck like a noose . he placed his hand against the wall to guide himself toward the door , turning his head back to look at her one more time .  look , sarah , i just  newline newline  not another word ! !  she screamed , her bottom lip quivering as tears began falling from her glossy eyes .  get out of my life .  newline newline he stood there at a loss in his work suit , finally reaching toward the door handle and pulling it open to be greeted viciously by the cold winter air . he stumbled down the steps onto the icy sidewalk , jumping slightly as he heard the door slam behind him and lock . newline newline dogs barked a few blocks away , snow falling from the blackness of the night sky . he did nt pay any mind to the fact that he was nt wearing a coat or gloves . he would rather get frostbite than live another day under these consequences . where did he go wrong ? how had he screwed up so bad , and this many times in a row ? he was so inebriated he could nt even think of a plausible answer . life was worth nothing anymore . he would rather die than live without her , and only after losing her did he finally realize that . newline newline moisture dripped from his nose due to the chilly air and his lack of insulation , and before long he felt a sneeze working its way toward a climax . he let it out with vehemence , nearly falling on the ice from the force of the outburst . newline newline newline  newline newline newline  you think you re better than me ?  said the taller , stronger kid backing earl against the brick wall just outside of the school s playground .  you think you re smarter ? you think you ve got better looks ?  newline newline a knee came to earl s groin this time , the young boy falling to the ground with his lungs robbed of air from the impact . the bully lifted him up by his shoulders again , landing a solid punch against the lowerleft part of earl s jaw . newline newline  make me look like a fool ever again , and i swear it ll hurt worse next time ,  said the taller kid as he leaned in close .  you ever speak to me again , or about me or around me , and i ll make sure everyone knows you re a freak who has to take pills to keep from going insane . got it ?  he wrapped his fingers around earl s neck , squeezing tightly .  i said got it , punk ? ?  newline newline  yes ,  earl choked out weakly , his heels lifted off the ground before the taller kid threw him swiftly against the metal rail next to the staircase nearby . newline newline  told you not to talk to me ,  smirked the bully as he walked around the corner quickly to avoid suspicion . newline newline earl stood up slowly , a sharp pain in his ribs scorching through his nerves from the impact . he rubbed his sore neck as he hobbled back toward the playground as quickly as he could , hoping to make it to open ground so that he would nt become an immediate target again . he would need to stay in open spaces as much as possible , and never walk anywhere alone . those were his only choices if he wanted to minimize the chances of getting brutally beaten again . newline newline  hey , are you all right ?  asked a darkhaired girl as she ran over to him , noticing that he was limping and appeared to be injured . newline newline  uh ... yeah ,  said earl as he avoided her gaze , looking down at the pavement .  just fell down the staircase . i m okay , though .  newline newline  oh , that s not good !  said the girl with a look of concern in her eyes .  we should get you to the school nurse right away ! she can at least make sure you do nt have any broken bones .  newline newline  i m fine , really i feel fine ,  said earl with more urgency in his voice , daring to look up further at her jeans and shirt but still not her face .  you do nt need to worry about me . nobody knows me anyway .  newline newline  well , i know you now !  she said with a laugh , stretching her back out .  what s your name ?  newline newline  earl , but that s a stupid name ,  said the boy as he stood up straight next to her , ignoring the pain in order to appear normal .  you can just call me e.k . if you want .  newline newline  i like earl better . is that all right ?  newline newline  sure ,  he said to the darkhaired girl as he finally worked up the courage to glance at her face .  what s your name ?  newline newline she smiled at him , brushing her hair out of her bright eyes as a few dead leaves blew past her feet .  i m sarah .  newline newline earl felt a sneeze coming on , and just as he was about to let it out he plugged his nose and kept it inside . newline newline  newlinei woke up to start the day like i would any other , but as soon as i twisted the knob to open the door , i was struck with surprise , the knob would nt turn . no matter how hard i tried that door was not going to open . i went to my bedroom window and tried to slide that open to see if anyone was trying to prank me , but it would nt budge either . i knew something was wrong , so i did the first thing any sane person would do , check reddit . newline newline the top post on the front page explained a situation exactly like mine , with over a million comments explaining their situation , all pleaing for help . some people said they used a gun to try and shoot out the window and the bullet did nt even leave a mark on the glass . others claimed that they smashed their doors with anything they could find , and it refused to open . i went back to my window and next door i could see people banging at their windows trying to get them open , to no avail . newline newline after going back on reddit to see if anyone had found a solution , i read one comment that said : newline newline   do not open your door newline newline  i have opened my door to see darkness , but i could see a pair of eyes glowing white , staring at me . as soon as i made eye contact the eyes were getting larger , as if this thing was coming towards me . i shut the door , and all i can hear is soft breathing on the other side , like it is waiting for me to open the door again . i m going to try and kill this thing , if i do nt reply to your comments , assume the worst .  newline newline after reading this i was extremely frightened , but i wanted to know how this redditor managed to open his door . i kept reading reply after reply until finally i saw a comment from op , it read : newline newline   he should nt have opened his door . he paid for what he has done , and anyone else to do the same will meet the same fate .  newline newline i had to close reddit after that . i knew that if i opened that door , i was going to die . i just had to hope it all passed . newline newline after a few days of sparing the water that i had , i ran out . i knew i had to make a stand if i was going to survive . i tried everything i could to open that door , and it would nt . finally , i lit it on fire , and it was actually burning away . the first thing i saw when the other side was revealed was darkness , and then i saw it . i saw two eyes glowing in the distance . i met my eyes with theirs , and they grew and grew . i stared it down as it came , and when it was about to hit me , i closed my eyes . newline newline i woke up staring at my ceiling like any other day . i shrugged off that experience as if it was a dream . i got up to take a shower , but the doorknob would nt turn . newline newline edit : better formatting newline newlinei suppose we were all saved by the sea . unlike the rivers , it never seemed to freeze over in an impenetrable way . near the shores , it got icy , like some slush of mud , fuel and ice that killed most of the shallow water wildlife , but the main throughways of the sea remained open . miles deep , they seemed to withstand the harshness of the great freeze and the temper of the daylight zone . not that anything was permanent like that ... the frozen areas saw light some days of the year , just as often as the daylight zone entered into several weeks of darkness . there is a logic to it , or so they say . newline newline it was interesting to watch at first . many thought that the continued sunlight  and lack thereof  would cause radical temperature shifts and pandemic . untrue . maybe , one day , the divide will grow rapidly . the few remaining scientists have yet to reach an agreement  most of the weather stations in service before the slow down were nt prepared to handle such a fundamental change . many of those that were fell victim to the twilight conflict in 32 . newline newline maybe the usgs was correct at the time to build its environmental monitoring stations on us military facilities , but that was decades ago . russia once sprawled across 11 time zones . now all we hear are rumors of constant warfare in the pitched black . each fragment of the former super power uses its limited haze  the last fragment of sunlight siberia will ever see  to rebuild walls , slaughter more livestock , and gaze upon color one last time . newline newline i was lucky enough to grow up by the water . and to live in the light . when the east fell into darkness , authoritarian governments arose out of nowhere . mostly , they came from military factions . nobody could have foretold how important night vision capabilities would become when only the army had them . in the americas , no revolutions of the sort took place . rather , there was a mass migration towards temperate climates and deepwater ports . newline newline when the slow down came , i was in school near a rather large port . what used to be baltimore . the western hemisphere got lucky , relatively speaking . people came streaming into the former united states from canada , fearing the coming of the winter . the sunlight kept the snow at bay , but the constancy of precipitation and flooding made the spring and late fall months unbearable . to the south the situation was more dire . the border was opened initially to offer amnesty to those refugees fearing the mindless persecution of the south american hyperreligious . but religion collapsed pretty fast . newline newline as i write this , the controversial panamerican agricultural commission has been authorized another 19,000 acres of postmexican land to keep up with the import demand from the balkans and has relocated or killed another 4,300  others  living in the hot zone . they were the ones blocked entry after the second outbreak of dengue fever in 2023 . newline newline there is no more  social justice ,  like i remember as a child . it s as like the unravelling of the world is what it took to realize people are brutally , violently , and irreconcilably human . the  others  die by the thousands and those who cling to the northern regions freeze . newline newline civilization has readjusted itself to the slow down and the darkened hemisphere of the great freeze needs our food as much as we need their guns . but the sun is is going to rise in a little while , and i want one more good night s sleep .propaganda posters covered the wall above a single bed in one corner of the room , illuminated by the warm morning light shining through a large trapezoid window . on the bed lay a crumpled black t shirt and a rifle , its holographic sight still turned on . a pair of gray and khaki polymer combat boots stood on the metal tiled floor at the foot of the bed . newline newline the wall opposite the posters was dominated by a large touchscreen above a white plastic desk , plugged into a white plastic cube . the three columns of data the monitor displayed changed as a woman hammered commands into the prompt below them . she wore nothing but black cargo pants and kneepads , their surfaces scratched from use . her irises glowed faintly , spinning rapidly as she refocused on different data . long brown hair fell past her shoulders . newline newline a head sized uav lay unmoving on the table , its chassis cut open . several cables connected it to the white cube . various sensors and transmitters had been removed from it and were collected in a pile at the end of the table . beside them was a laptop displaying a cli with an angular black wristband connected to it . newline newline the woman continued scanning through the drone s memory , searching for what she needed . she stopped and clicked her tongue as a string of letters and numbers appeared in the third column . newline newline she leaned across the table to pull the laptop and wristband closer . the laptop printed a page of text as she entered a command , decrypting the data she was looking for . she copied the files to the wristband and detached it from the laptop , fastening it around her left wrist . it projected a 3d map of the interior of a building , with several points marked by glowing cubes . lines appeared and vanished , leading in different paths around the building . newline newline the woman stopped the projection and swiveled off her chair . newline newline                          newline newline it s really hard to write something with one character , one room , no backstory , and an activity that does nt lend itself to descriptions . pulling a plaintext encryption key out of a uav s memory is of course ridiculous , but it was that or a 3000 word cryptanalysis infodump . i ll avoid using that kind of thing as a major plot element in the future unless i can accurately describe the process without boring the reader . newline newline i like the first paragraph , but after that it gets worse . from the first you can get that someone has recently gotten back from doing something with a rifle , and that person has propaganda posters all over one wall . it established the character fairly well without explicitly saying anything about her . newline newline throughout the whole thing the writing feels repetitive and sometimes disjointed . newline newline all 319 words took 7 hours to write between 2 days which is absolutely ridiculous . newline newline maybe i ll write something about what that map is and why she wanted it .it was time , i nodded to my compatriot across the aisle and we both stood up . newline newline  nobody move , this is a hijacking  i pointed the my smuggled gun straight up . my compatriot did the same , only to be jumped by one of the passengers . he fired two rounds into the passenger and i cursed as the other passengers began to panic . newline newline strangely enough , something to calm the passengers down came from the annoying ding noise of the announcement system . newline newline  uhh ... this is your captain speaking  newline newline the passengers looked at us , and my compatriot nodded before i started to move towards the cockpit . newline newline  i have turned on the fasten seatbelt sign because our autopilot has just stopped working .  newline newline i was now in the first class area of the plane , almost to the cockpit , and waving my gun at those who thought to investigate the shots convinced those people to get out of my way . newline newline  and i regret to inform you that i do nt actually know how to fly this plane . the copilot and i are just people they pay minimum wage to sit here while the autopilot does the work .  newline newline those who looked like they were considering resisting my takeover attempt stopped before they all began screaming . i quickly moved to the door to the cockpit . newline newline  let me in , i can fly this plane  newline newline  who are you ?  asked someone from the cockpit . i assumed must be the copilot . newline newline  i came to hijack the plane . i can fly it  newline newline  well i m not letting you in here now .  newline newline several passengers and the stewardess nearest to me looked at me after this announcement , then when the plane lurched they all stood and joined me in attacking the door . newline newline the godforsaken announcement ding noise happened again and i wondered what the so called pilot had to say now . newline newline  we are now in an uncontrolled descent at a rapid rate so i have turned off the no smoking sign ... . soooo smoke em if you got em . i was in the second grade when i first forayed into discworld . my oldest brother had a copy of small gods with a shiny turtle on the front . i took it to school and read it every day during our reading time . i definitely did nt understand the vast majority of it , but i read through the damn thing and asked teachers for help with any words i did nt know and continued to read discworld from there on out . i still haven  read them all and there are few things better than being in a used book store , finding a title i have nt read , devouring it , and passing it on to someone else . newline newline currently dming a pathfinder campaign with the main city taking a lot of influence from ankhmorpork . will read discworld to children at bedtime . newline newline maybe we ll start with  where s my cow ? wrists slit , eyes gouged , a cryptic symbol carved into her chest , she laid in a puddle of her own blood on the bathroom floor . that s how i found my sister . it was the middle of the night and i had woken up to get a drink and i found her there . i screeched like a banshee and ran for my parents room . newline newline  annie s dead ! annie s dead !  i screamed over and over again . blubbering and crying the whole time . my mother held me close while my father went to see what the hell i was yelling about . newline newline  check her room ,  my mother said ,  he s probably just having a bad dream .  when my father turned on the light i swear i saw a black figure in the mirror with glowing orange eyeballs . i screeched some more , and it disappeared . my mother held me ,  calm down honey it s all going to be okay .  newline newline my father returned ,  call the cops , we need to get out of here .  his eyes were watery , and his voice was shaky , but i credit him all these years later for not losing his shit . as we left the house there was a low laugh coming from the walls . so low that i do nt know if anyone else heard , at the time i was nt sure if i heard . he packed us up in our rusty truck and sped down the lonely dirt road . i sobbed in the back , my mother sobbed up front . only my father could choke back his tears . newline newline  daddy ,  i asked ,  was it a serial killer ?  before he replied there were headlights appeared on the top of the hill . newline newline my father said ,  what the ...  we never got visitors , especially not in the middle of the night .  they re not taking us too !  he swerved into the fields beside the road and slammed on the gas . newline newline my mother looked at the phone ,  our service has been cut off . honey , what s happening ?  newline newline  it appears whoever took our daughter is out for us too .  we burst out of the crops and onto the road . there were police cars blocking the road . our truck crashed into one and we tumbled off the road . i found myself laying on the ceiling . boots were approaching the car . newline newline  do nt move , we mean no harm .  a voice said . it did nt sound like a sinister serial killer s voice , it sounded like the voice of a police officer . newline newline turns out that was a pretty close guess . newline newline it was a group of people in suits and sunglasses even though it was dark . they gave us blankets and coffee to my parents  i got a milkshake  and escorted us to the mobile lab . which was a semitruck with a clean laboratory full of computers and instruments in the trailer . newline newline  newline newline edit : part 2 is up !i sprang back up after the last of the jolts had left my body , waiting for my opponent to come at me head on . newline newline that electric fence was new , i had nt seen it in the previous games and who knows how i was still standing right now . newline newline a primal part of my head recoiled at the thoughts that just passed through my mind . language , syntax , object naming , how on earth did i just think what i just thought ? i suddenly became aware of the fact that i was a small insignificant being standing on a dusty rock floating out in the infinite darkness , whilst becoming acutely uncomfortable with the idea of standing in the middle of a populated arena clad in only a loincloth to hide my shame . newline newline i looked down at my hands , and looked back up . the man lunged at me with a makeshift spear and the thoughts faded suddenly , as my arms sprang into action and grabbed the weapon in midair using the momentum to flip my opponent onto the ... . my head hurt again , what were these thoughts that my mind was somehow stringing together . newline newline the man slapped backfirst into the ground as i disarmed him , and that should have been my moment right there to go in for the kill and finish him off . instead i just stared at him numbly , seeing a reflection of myself in his eyes . newline newline i am this dumb brute i see before me . i was this dumb brute i see before me . i was different now , and he could see it too  trying to get a read off my body language and finding only silence . he was nt sure whether to charge or flee , and instead just squirmed on the spot waiting for me to make a move . newline newline why me ? why now ? i was nt anything special , and here i was now standing at the edge of the pit , profoundly aware of my existence . i suddenly feared for my mortality , feared for everyone s . newline newline i dropped the spear in confusion and took a step back , and that was all my opponent needed to see as he flew for my neck and muscled me to the ground . i could feel my airways constricting as he gripped hard , but i poked him in the eye and he relented for a moment giving me enough time to slip out of his grip , but not enough time to dodge a blow to the face which i oddly saw coming but somehow was nt quick enough to avoid . newline newline this was going to end one way or another , and i realised that i wanted to live more than i wanted him to not die . newline newline i staggered backwards towards the perimeter , feigning weakness , and he took the bait  throwing a kick forward that offbalanced him when i dodged , and then it was a small matter to sweep him off his feet altogether and throw him into the fence . newline newline he twitched before he hit the ground but then lay limp . he was dead , or so i thought until i saw his arm come up as he tried to steady himself back onto his feet . newline newline i grabbed a rock , prepared to smash his head in if it really came to it , but he suddenly looked up at me and i realised that something was nt the same . i lowered the rock .it was dark outside even for me . i opened up my window to look out on the street . the warm louisiana air hit my face , cooling my sweat as it dripped down my forehead . i looked out on the street scanning for any people . the street lights were on that did nt change . the thing that they were calling the  sickness  had blinded everyone on planet earth in the past two weeks , excluding myself . the street was empty . not an unusual sight in my part of the neighborhood , but it did give me an uneasy feeling . i knew it was normal , but knowing that everyone else was blind , unnerved me . newline newline i decided to get my shoes on and head outside towards more populated spots in town . i walked right in the middle of the empty street . there were no more people driving now that everyone was sightless . you do nt know how alone you can feel in a city without that constant thrum of car engines coming and going . i would give anything right now to hear the doppler effect in full swing . newline newline i finally arrived at the nearest gas station . all the lights were off except for the few that were right above the gas stations . a moment of moral ambiguity came over me like missing an assignment in grade school when your teacher told everyone to turn their assignments in . no one could possibly figure out it was me if i ransacked this place or any place for that matter . i could do anything i want . as far as anyone else is concerned i ca nt fuckin  see either . i chuckled and left the gas station heading towards my sisters house . newline newline i arrived about half an hour later . new orleans is a pretty big place . my sister s house was white with grey trim . her marigolds were just blooming on her front porch flower beds . that s a very sad thing to think about when you know she wo nt ever see them again . no lights were on in the house , but i suppose that is to be expected . i contemplated on knocking but decided to try the door first . it was locked . i knocked anyway and heard slow precise foot steps as someone came to the door . larry , my sister s husband , answered . newline newline  hello ?  he said with a voice filled with confusion .  hey , larry it s george . is mary around ?  i said .  oh ! how are you georgie ? how the hell did you make it over here ?  he replied as he opened the door .  i. . uh . . . i ve lived my whole life here man . i know these streets like the back of my hand .  i replied having no idea why i had just lied to my brotherinlaw .  well that s pretty damn fantastic if you ask me . i ve been pissin  my whole life and now i ca nt seem to stop wetting my feet every morning . mary ! george is here !  he called up the stairs as i walked into their house . newline newline she came down the stairs slowly feeling her way along the rail and doing a kind of side step . this was to painful to watch . my older sister had always been the shining star that i could always shoot for in my life . now she was reduced to feebleness . i knew in time she would be the most productive blind person around here , but right now i wanted to be anywhere besides the bottom of this wooden staircase . newline newline i walked over to her to give her a hug when she finally reached the bottom .  hi georgie , how is life going for you . you seem to be adjusting pretty well .  she said as we let go of each other .  i m fine mary . how are you and larry getting along ?  i said with a bit of concern in my voice . larry answered for her  we re fine brother . i do nt know how we are going to restock our food , but i m sure we will manage .  he meant well even though i bit back the urge to tell him i was talking to my sister .  that s good . very good actually . i just came over here to check on you .  i told her .  i ve been listening to the radio . all other stations are down , but the emergency is still going strong . they say we should all stay indoors until the blindness wears off , but i was never really good at listening to what the government has to say .  they both gave a little laugh . that was good . i needed to hear that .  now that i know you guys are ok i think i ll head to wally world for some supplies . what do you need ?  i asked .  oh no george we ca nt ask you to go out there when you ca nt see .  she said with worry .  it s ok sis i ve already been there a couple of times . i can do this .  larry finally said  if you are going , we do need a few things . canned food would probably be top priority . now i do nt condone stealing so i ll give you all the bills i have in my wallet . there should be a few hundred dollars so get us what we need and yourself and leave it somewhere the retail workers will see it when they eventually come back if you can .  newline newline heading towards walmart i could nt stop thinking of how my sister looked . her eyes were all white . it even looked like some of the skin under her eyes was getting darker . a sense of hopelessness filled my head . how in the hell was all this supposed to work out ? if everyone was blind were there any scientists working on this affliction or was everyone literally in the dark ? i did nt want to think about what would happen if this thing stuck around for another six months . i m starting to finally realize that maybe i m the only one who wo nt be able to adjust . . . .the unsub we re looking for is a sociopath with little regard for the lives of others , unless it s for his own form of entertainment  in his case , cruelty and killing . newline newline his mo is nt set in stone , showing that he likes to experiment in terms of taking lives  this time it was a crossbow , earlier it was decapitation . he s yet to settle into a preferred killing pattern but once has done so , you should start seeing patterns emerge . newline newline we do nt think that any of these murders are , in fact , premeditated . he prefers to kill in the heat of the moment anyone who crosses his path . this could suggest a longtime desire to kill anyone he perceives to be a tormentor , whether intended on the aggressor s part or not . newline newline also , we found rather expensive fabrics on the crime scenes that we do nt believe come from any of the victims , which suggests that the unsub comes from a wealthy family . this could mean his family has connections meaning they could try and bury this by paying the mayor or other officials . since he s killed at least two people so far and you know someone engaging in this kind of behavior then take no risks  arrest immediately . newline newline also , i want to point out that the unsub , because he may come from a rich family , may not see his victims as people as you and i would , but rather as lesser creatures such as cattle . a similar case would be victor zsasz , a schizophrenic who thought his victims were souls trapped in rotting corpses which were freed when he killed them . i just want to point out that this is not the case  he lacks any feelings to these people , suggesting a delusion of grandeur where he would believe himself to be superhuman , a king or even a god . newline newline if you see this kind of behavior in your suspect pools , let us know .little mina coughed , her long black hair a mess as she spoke to me . her parents called my company because she had a request , but when i heard it i could nt really think of anything to say . newline newline  a ... are you sure you want to meet the temptress ?  i asked . the girl nodded . newline newline  yes ...  newline newline  but she s a villain .  i said . the girl nodded again . newline newline  i know .  newline newline i took a deep breath and gave her a smile . newline newline  i ll see what i can do .  i said . i looked at her parents but i did nt want to say anything . they were already suffering enough with their 10 year old daughter dying . it was cancer , a very aggressive form that was eating the poor kid up . i went right back to my office to see what i could do . newline newline    newline newline super heroes had their pr agents and unions . you name the hero there was a hundred different ways to call them . hell they got off on the great press visiting a sick kid got them ! newline newline but villains ? oh they had their groups and all , and trying to get in contact with them was ... very fucking difficult ! newline newline well ... okay that s a bit of an understatement . you would have an easier time punching god in the face and pissing on the devil s breakfast than trying to get one of the villain corps on the phone ! newline newline logging into the deep web it took me a better part of two days before finally finding one , then another couple days to find the one the temptress was a part of . after making sure they knew i was nt a cop or a hero trying to bust themher i was finally able to arrange a meeting with her ! newline newline    newline newline the temptress was a beautiful woman with long black hair , an amazing body and looks that would put any model to shame ! she was pure sex and she knew it . even if she did nt have powers to control people though lust she would have no problem getting anything she wanted . she had never been caught by any hero or police force . her last criminal act she pretty much did the worlds biggest mugging . during the super bowl she got out on the field and caused what many considered the worlds biggest orgy . while the crowd and players were busy getting it on temptress and her men stole anything they could ... on live tv ! newline newline and now here i was standing in her hide out , her henchmen pointing guns at me as she sat on an expensive throne . she smiled at me as she was damn near naked . she had a tattoo on the side of her face of a spiderweb with a black widow in the middle of it and near her eye a small rose . she kept looking me over , licking her lips . newline newline  so ... you with make a wish or something ?  she asked . newline newline  something like that ... i m with the hero connection . we have super heroes meet up with terminally sick children ...  newline newline  because the last time i did a make a wish thing ,  she interrupted ,  it was a little sick boy and his wish was for me to take his virginity ! and i helped him out then you assholes and his parents tried to get me for statutory rape and necrophilia ! i mean i did let him die with a smile on his face but i did nt know he would while i rode him !  newline newline her men laughed . newline newline  miss temptress ...  i started to say but she cut me off again . newline newline  just temptress sweet heart .  newline newline  okay ... temptress . i assure you i am not with make a wish . it is a 10 year old girl named mina . she has class 4 cancer and is adamant that she meets you before she dies !  newline newline temptress sat there , looking me over . she smiled . newline newline  fine , i ll meet her , under one condition .  newline newline  name it !  i said a little to eagerly . newline newline  i get you for a whole week ! nothing taboo !  she said with a very big smile . newline newline  i think you would be into pegging !  she added . newline newline i swallowed nervously . newline newline    newline newline the day of the meet up came . i had laid out ground rules for her . i told her she could nt wear anything too revealing . she pouted , bitching about how she wanted people to see the little  slut  tattoo on the side of her asscheek . i told her not to use her powers and for god s shake try not to fuck the child or anyone in the hospital . she teased about  saving it all up for me  . newline newline i walked with her down the hallway , the spike heels of her black thigh high boots clacking on the tile floor . she was wearing a long black trench coat as she walked with a commanding purpose . i looked over at her as we neared the room . newline newline  please tell me you are wearing something under the coat .  i whispered . she smiled . newline newline  just my birthday suit and boots baby !  she growled . i was about to say something when she rolled her eyes . newline newline  i m teasing ! god lighten up !  newline newline i kept quiet i we stopped in front of mina s door . newline newline  let me introduce you , then you walk in .  i said . temptress nodded . newline newline    newline newline i walked into mina s room . her condition got worse the last several days . i gave a weak smile as she looks like she was about to fall asleep . newline newline  mina ... i brought someone here to see you .  i said . her mom tried to say something when the little girl s eyes opened wide . i turned to see the temptress walked in and for a moment had a smile on her face . newline newline  hi there i heard ...  the temptress started to say but then stopped . her face went pale as she saw the sick child . mina smiled at the woman before her . newline newline  hi mommy ...  mina said . temptress broke down crying . newline newline i looked at the girl then to the temptress , there was no denying it ... newline newline mina was the temptress  daughter . your wish shall be granted . viel glck !  newline newline  gleichfalls ...  i did nt like the sound of that viel glck . newline newline time shrunk , morphed , and metamorphosed itself from 2016 to 1994 . the quick glitter of buildings once built torn into oblivion , the pavements once orderly itself into an disorganized mess , and cars once lively and bustling in their city hustle fashion were smaller . newline newline i got up from the bench at a nearby bus stop and examined the surroundings . what was once organized into one of the busiest intersections became one of the smaller , slower intersections . staples toward downtown did not seem too lively as a few apartment complexes dot the landscape . opposite of staples laid a street once held and cuddled by a large swath of trees with large leaves . the trees , recently seen by my past self in the 80s , covered the streets with very little sunlight and provided the cool , the beautiful scenery ... a scenery in 1994 no longer there due to land development . newline newline saratoga was nt busy yet as it is morning , almost striking noon . i knew what i had to do . i had been preparing myself for years , wondering what i would do in order to make myself cease  to exist and birth a new future me . i pulled out the note to make sure it remained intact . newline newline alas , it is definitely intact . here s what i wrote . newline newline dear ait convarion ,  newline newline this letter was intended for you to read at the quickest notice . many things will progress to the point where you will wish , like me , to go back in time and change the one thing that would irrevocably alter your future .  newline newline first , let me tell you what the future holds for you at this present time . you will grow up doing so well in high school in your first year , suffer horribly in the last three years . you will end up dropping out of your first college , the second , and so on until you find your programming and business administration degree , studied german , and finally lived in germany for quite a while . you will become one of the best geschftfhrers ever lived , accomplished stick driving with a cochlear implant , and finally got laid at 40 , no doubt to a vixen at 18 . all of this will be parallel to your father .  newline newline your father suffered under your grandfather . he was a rebel , much like you . he did so well yet did so much to cause disdain . he became an adulterer , having sex with married women , seeking wealth to alleviate the suffering of poverty , and graduated from college too late in his life . his death will bring you no remedy , no cure , and no solace . his death will be a mixed bag of bitterness , suffering , and altogether conflicted . do not seek to understand his apology to you before he died . know that his apology will come far much late , underscoring the significance of your future problem .  newline newline you have a choice . choose to do or do nt . i will not interfere as i can not directly help you . i can only send you messages to guide you while i rebuild myself again . if you do wish to accept my guidance , write  yes  in red on an envelope and place it in the barn inside your father s shed , on top of that tool table . do not seek me . know that i will receive your messages at night .  newline newline understand that i am willing to ensure that you have a great future , a much better one than your father ever will . you will not only become one of the best geschftfhrers ever lived in germany , but you will also become wealthy . you will eclipse your father and arouse his fears of you becoming greater than he ever will be . the only downside to this is you will lose certain things in your life ... there will be no tobias saunders . there will be no dranmury follet . you will have new friends but you will become successful far earlier , get laid earlier , and still be married to that 18yearold vixen at 40 .  newline newline keep in touch and do not be alarmed . i am not here to hurt you . i m here to guide you . auf wiedersehen !  newline newline ihr freund ,  newline newline ait convarion newline newline well , that s that . i m glad that this letter was kept intact . i look down the street where the trees once graced the streets . here i go ...  i walk down the street , knowing where i was supposed to go . newline newline i sweated for at least an hour , walking around the curved bend outside the city limits . as i approached this large line of palm trees , towered over by one lone palm tree on top of a perched gravel road , the barn and the house was visible . to the far right was a nice beautiful home , much spacious , and with it adjacent a storage barn , once having stored a cessna . i knew who flew that cessna but that was in the 80s . newline newline i checked that blue house with white shutters to see if any vehicles were parked in front of that fence . hmm ... no one was there . this could do .  i entered the gravel road , heading to the barn . i checked inside . the stalls were empty save one . a neigh reared itself into the air . newline newline  stan ... long time no see ... here ...  i petted him .  my brother will end up missing you very often . you ve been a good horse to him .  the horse neighed a bit .  bye , stan .  i turned away . newline newline jesus , this is really real .  newline newline i approached the tool shed , entered inside and took a look . pops  old tools ... ha , i remember him hammering away sometimes . nostalgia ...  i look at that corner and knew i had realized something in 2000s . newline newline i heard a vehicle travel down the gravel road . the sound was remarkably distinct , even after all these years . living on a farm with horses , peacocks , and knowing how gravel roads sounded ... these do nt escape you . i peer outside , and see a truck kicking up gravel , and ducked back inside quickly . newline newline i think this is it .  i grabbed the note , folded it , and placed it into an envelope , and closed the seal . i wrote down my name to be sure that it was addressed properly . newline newline schiesse !  i turned off the lights in the tool shed , and hid in the corner . maybe that s what attracted pops in the first place . newline newline indistinct talking . it sounded like a young boy and an older man talking . that boyish voice ... i knew that voice . i could nt breathe too well because this is all coming too fast . plus , i knew this damned tool shed was so stuffy full of dust . i also had tears streaming down my cheek , knowing what i did in 1994 and not having the power to end it . newline newline the soft sound of footsteps , mixed with shuffling , grew louder . i stood quietly in the dark like a mouse . the door was left open and the man stepped inside . he turned on the lights , and approached his tool shed , sitting down . newlinefirst story , any critisism will be greatly appreciated , im not very good at creative writing lol . hope you enjoy newline newline through here please newline newline the red

newline another gangfight , i thought . i warped out a bazooka and aimed it outside my window . pulling and holding the trigger , i quickly mentally reloaded it , and my bazooka became automatic .

politicians arguing , shouting , fighting and killing each other . it was just another battle between the democratic gang and the republican gang . newline newline i knew something had to be done . so

to his gang . newline newline it was possible to feel the 138 other pair of eyes aiming into my skull with their rifles . newline newline  and my gang does nt like random people coming here out of nowhere , claiming random things that they are nt . boys , fire away .  newline newline immediately , the 138 gunfires i heard had triggered their 138 bullets aimed at my skull . newline newline but , as i was a reality warper , and i was also insane , i decided to turn around , pluck the bullets off from the nowstill air , and stuff each of their stopped bullet up their asses . then , as i let time continue flowing as per normal , i watched them as they winced from having such an item in them . newline newline  now ,  i turned to the leader and spoke ,  do you believe me ?  newline newline but i did nt see him standing anywhere . rather , he was on the floor . apparently , he had fainted from shock . newline newline little did they know , this was only my first step to taking over the united states . did my mom put you up to this ?  newline newline  what ? no . listen ,  said the tall stranger with the dark glasses .  do you remember that time when you fell off the monkey bars and hit your head when you were eight and a stranger carried you back to your parents ?  newline newline  yes , but  newline newline  that was us ,  said the stranger .  you may have died that day if you hadn  t been given prompt medical attention.  newline newline  so you  re telling me  newline newline  i  m telling you that we have been there every moment of your life , watching , guiding you to the destiny that you are meant for.  newline newline  and because i didn  t  newline newline  there  s only so much we can do . we can not force you to do anything , only guide . and because you did not fulfill your duties on this day , you have set off a chain reaction in your life that will echo into the future and taint your decisions and actions for years to come.  newline newline  all because i  newline newline  but there  s still hope ,  said the stranger .  the destiny i have laid out before you , the future you are meant to have , oh promised one , can still happen . you must not only right the wrongs you have committed this morning , but you must work hard every day to stay on the good path and achieve what you were always meant to achieve.  newline newline  and you  re sure my mom didn  t put you up to this ?  newline newline  i assure you i  ve never met your mother . but i  ll tell you who i have met ,  said the stranger .  i  ve met you , in the future . i  ve met two versions of you . your dereliction has caused a split in reality , a rift that has spawned two possible futures . in one version of the future , you are a worthless , lazy , knownothing bum who spends his days sitting on the curb doing nothing . in the other version , you are a brave leader , a visionary , a man who all the world looks up to and who will guide them through the dark times to come , the one you were always meant to be , the promised one.  newline newline  fine , fine , i  ll take care of it , i  ll fix things , please just stop with all this nonsense.  newline newline  very well , promised one . we will be watching you , so please do not forget your duties ever again . it could have tragic consequences.  newline newline and ever since then , i  ve never forgotten to take out the trash when my mom asks me to .day one : the world is beautiful . the forests always remind me that.my father once told me , killing is an act of nature , never forget that . most think it s barbaric , but to be honest , it s all in the intention . you honer the prey , it is to be respected . you are not killing a helpless animal , ever . from bear to boar , from elk to elephant , from hamster to human , we are all on earth because we respected the law of nature  that might makes right and we must earn our survival . i do not pity my prey , nor do i think it my better : we simply play our part . newline newline day two : predator was a film . it is not real , but i am , and here we are . i have sprung his trap , and he made it known . when hunting a wild beast , the game is fair  it is born knowing it will be hunted , and i know i am a hunter . this is a law to be respected among all those who hunt for sport : for title . whatever it is , it knows this . it appeared before me , this afternoon , i was caught in a snare of it s design , but it did not move in for the kill . it simple made itself known . held up a blade , or club , or something . something that let me know it was not about weapons , or tech , but rather sport . he wants me , but i will not go genitally . newline newline day three : he has not seen me since yesterday , or at least not shown . my only hope is to run . i will not be a trophy , i will live , and i will earn it . newline newline day four : i am alone . there is no help for me . newline newline day five : i will not be killed . newline newline day six : i wait for him . this pond is an old hunting ground and i know it as well as my own heart . it tracks movement , so the time for running is over . my trap set , my mind steeled  here i stand . newline newline day six , evening : he came , and he failed . he knew where i would be , but did not consider i would anticipate that . whatever he hunted with was no match for a thirty aught six and he died . newline newline day forty : the hunt begins again , i prey it comes for me again . a hunters death for a hunter .i kept my head low as i walked through the school hallway on my way back from lunch . not that we actually had to eat to survive . i suppose it was to let kids talk to their friends . newline newline the class was only a few more meters away , and then i d have more time to read in the back of the room as mrs. hansel droned on and on about logarithms . i already knew enough to pass the test on monday anyways . i always did . newline newline i grabbed my book as soon as i sat . i was rereading it of course . i did nt have enough money to buy anything new . newline newline i let out a sigh as i opened war and peace once more . newline newline i always had an issue with boredom . there was nt much to do in life . i mean , that s a lie . there was plenty . i just did nt really care about any of it . newline newline who wants to do math for a living ? or anything you really learn in school ? i could write , but i do nt have the patience to write boring , but necessary scenes . newline newline i coughed loudly , causing everyone to look at me . mumbling something about a tickle in my throat , i looked back down at my book . that was odd . my throat was not  ticking  at all . newline newline  newline newline one year later newline newline  newline i knew i was dying . they knew i was dying . i was sick . they gave me these looks . some pity and sorrow but most were of disgust . i smiled back at them . newline newline from the earliest i remember , we were told that if someone was ill , that they were  bad people  . after all , that s how most wars end . somebody eventually gets so corrupt , their soul gets so dirty , they fall ill and die . if your relatives were dead , you never speak of them , because you re related to somebody who was a monster . how disgusting .  newline newline is nt it odd ? i never understood why people cared so much . it s not like that meant you were a monster , right ? newline newline my own family no longer cared about me . they wanted to forget about me . those looks of pity i got sometimes on the way to class ? those were for them , not me . they felt bad that my family had to deal with me . newline newline i guess i wanted to forget about me too . newline newline at first , i thought there was something wrong . i m not a monster . i have nt done bad things . maybe my soul was having a bad week and i d get better soon , or , however , that would work . now , i know more . i m not dying because i m a bad person . i m dying of boredom . newline newline i m dying because i do nt care enough to live . newline newline i guess i get why people do silly , unnecessary things , like eating and drinking , even when we did nt need to . it was to cure boredom . it was to keep people occupied , to keep their souls busy , so they could nt collect dust like mine has . newline newline i coughed once more , i could almost feel my soul slip even farther away .alice , newline newline every day without you is the the new worst day of my life . i long for when i ll be able to come home and see you and michael . i only have two weeks to go , i promise i ll make it . tell michael to remember to do his chores and study hard , we have some catching up when i g newline newline if you are reading this out loud by others , stop . i am private yuri profoskiz . your husband was brave man , went down fighting . i did not want to hurt him or others , but not would

newline the four men looked at eachother . one of them speaks up :  fuck !  , another one speaks :  do nt worry . we can just start over on mars .  newline newline the lead astronaut then lifts his chin up , and speaks up ,  oh yeah ! we were going to go colonize mars for this mission anyway , how convenient ! newline newline there is a brief silence , and then the four men cheer . newline

newline supervising lars in his efforts to unhitch the camper took more energy then i really had to spare , so i d one again taken to laying down , trying my best to ignore the loud shouts and yells of soldiers in the distance . that was more difficult than i d expected . newline newline from the tinted window along the trailer s far wall , i had a perfect view of the messy affair that had recently devolved from a relatively organized crusading army . from stumbling boots slipping on black stone and sand , to flags whipping freely in the wind on longshafted spears , hundreds of figures shuffled in organized rows going nowhere fast . newline newline standing proud in the distance , a giant and towering obelisk of stone was drenched in a glow of magic , large orbiting pieces of similar material floating along side its great height as lines of rope pulled taunt along its center . more than fifty lines now , but a rough count , and a parade of large and burly men screaming beneath as they went about tugging on those lengths with assistance of horses and a midsized suv . newline newline far as i could tell , that stone relic was nt coming down . newline newline for all the effort being spent , they might as well be tying ropes to a mountain for all the good it would do them . the stone seemed stubbornly resistant to the small army attempting to bring about its demise . a rather anticlimactic hiccup on the northern army s noble march to victory newline newline none of that was any of my business though , not today . under strict orders and a menacing shovel leaning outside my door i knew i should be resting , focused instead on recovery . newline newline   three hours of meditation a day , focus your inner strength and concentrate on healing . eight hours of sleep , stretch slowly at morning and at dusk .   that s what the healer had told me , and i d done my best to live up to it , but it was all easier said than done . especially when trying to ignore the aching pain of three slowly recovering stab wounds . newline newline laying around with nothing to do might have once been a mastered skill in my life , but now it was nothing short of agony . newline newline as it was , so much as i d been recommended sleep and meditation , neither were coming along nicely , and my eyes were searching for anything that might hold my attention elsewhere than the bandaged portions of my midsection and thigh . from the cupboards , sealed and tied shut to avoid opening , to the calendar , now restarted for a second run through of the year as a rough guesstimate of my time spend abroad ,  so to speak . finally , i found something of interest . newline newline on the small desk and shelf beside my bed , i watched the flickering glow of a green pulsing light . it seemed almost magical here in this place , and i supposed it was a kind of magic : a much more realistic kind . the kind of magic that happened without the spells and incantations or the flashy fireballs and thunderbolts . newline newline a cellphone , usually left charging in the suv , taken back on occasion for the sake of occasionally replaying the same few minigames i d installed on it years ago . the phone itself was nothing special : if anything it was cheap , second class to the newest models for sale in any store whose parkinglot i d taken to snoozing in on my roadtrips , but the device was nt what had captured my attention . newline newline instead it was the green pulsing light associated with an indication of a missed call : something that should nt have been possible . newline newline i could joke all day with offhand comments like  can you hear me now ?   or  it s a deadzone  but with honesty , i was fairly certain there was nt a single cell tower within the entire plane of existence i now inhabited . there probably was nt another cellphone to call me either . newline newline it creeped me the hell out : a missed call in a place like this was like the last man on earth getting a knock at the door . somehow though , there it was . yet another blinking light  another impossible missed call . this would be the sixth time since my arrival , and i was no less unnerved by the occurrence . newline newline from whatever process was letting the calls ring through  or at least flashed an indicator to tell me that they had  my own theories were abundant , but the calls always came with a voicemessage and a text . newline newline the messages i d only been able to see mentions of on my phone , never listen to . like i said , it s a dead zone completely absent of celltowers or satellites . no way to make a call to my inbox without some of those , but the text massages were different . newline newline the date stamps made no sense . neither did the duplication effect , multiples of each one that came through but i could at least read those , partly . between all sorts of jumbled garbage and useless values , there was always one legible word : one tiny bit of information that made me confident that what was being sent had a purpose in mind . newline newline carefully , arm trembling at the length of its stretch , my hand felt around the cool plastic and glass , lifting the device into view as i flicked open the screen with a practiced touch . newline newline  new text message .  newline newline    a       !                 l     i         !  !                                    ! ! !                                                                                                                   v

glass display with patience until the last piece was noted . newline newline alive newline newline i already knew what the other words were . god only knew how many times i had looked them over late in the evening , trying to confirm if there was some deeper meaning in the months between . carefully i took out the pen and notebook from its resting place beside the bed , flipping open the pages to

solemnity on the leeside slopes of the hills . william miller crossed over the dale towards the highlands and the woods behind , his newly shaven face ruddy with youthful countenance and the biting autumnal chill reminiscent of the western moors . a sickly heifer , near invisible in the clouded translucence , lows in the distance . as he marched with a loping stride somewhere between giddy adolescence and adult resolve , the lures and footholds of his trade clanging against his back , the thick western forest infested with savage red men fixed in his mind , abigail patchett watched him from afar , her urge to shout and wave settled by an incessant tug at the hem of her woolen shawl . her eyes loitered upon the spot where he faded into the brume shroud until her aunt called her to the loom . newline newline  newline newline  take these ,  the widow blackwood offered ,  and hang one outside his window and place another under your pillow . do this on the night of the next full moon . venus will be in the house of libra . in his dreams he will see you and within a fortnight approach you.  newline newline the wigwam is dark and warm and fetid with the smell of tallow and charcoal . in the candle light widow blackwood smiles with blackened teeth and knowing looks , obsequious in her winks and nods and the insinuating way she repeats her understanding of young women  s desires . abigail tugs at her shawl and does not quicken her step until the smoke from the wigwam disappears against the horizon . the caws of a rook follow her all the way home . newline newline  newline newline night is still and uncanny in the baleful moonlight . she has counted the oil paper windows and knows by heart that the second is his . she hangs the charm with a tack on the deer bone lintel . an owl splits the darkness with a cry of  who ? who ?  newline newline  william miller ,  she whispers in reply . newline newline  newline newline redfaced and bellowing , his breath sour with cider , spittle flies from the frothing corners of his mouth as uncle caleb demands to know from where she has come . tremulous and wearing an idiot  s smile , all she can think is how heavy steps and the hiss of the cat have undone her . she does not feel the first blow until after she pushes herself up from the dirt floor . lifted by her hair she does not wait long to produce the figure woven of feathers and twigs and a lock of her own hair . between sobs and whimpers into her shawl , she whispers a name to her mother  s sister that will absolve her . newline newline  newline newline  patience blackwood ,  the magistrate calls ,  you stand accused by the good man caleb mayhew of practicing dark arts , having congress with wicked spirits , and contriving to bring his niece abigail under the influence of satan your master . having entered no plea and been named in the testimony of your neighbors as conducting odd rites and making rituals to your dark lord by moonlight , this court finds you guilty of the charge of witch craft . thou have forsaken the way of the lord and refused to repent for your wickedness , so the court has no choice but to condemn thee to death by hanging until you breathe no more and to split your property and claims among your neighbors . so signed , carpus lawton , justice of the peace.  newline newline the magistrate nods to carpenter , who wears the brown scarf of official anonymity across his face underneath a wide brimmed capotain , and he fits the noose around her neck before stepping backwards towards the lever on the scaffold . newline newline  have ye any last words ?  newline newline  qui sine peccato est vestrum primus in illam lapidem mittat.  newline newline justice lawton  s face contorts darkly and he nods curtly to the carpenter . the trap door is released and the widow blackwood falls slowly until the hemp fibers jerk her upwards with savage resistance . her legs kick about for an eternity until she is still , suspended in a moment in history until she will be forgotten amidst a long ledger of names and accusations and irrevocable sentences . the hood refused , she stares out from underneath the leathery folds of her wrinkled skin at the crowd with bulging eyes . her tongue , swollen with death , protrudes in a posthumous act of petulance . the smell of excrement fills the afternoon . dogs bark and sniff the gallows as the crowd begins to dissipate . from across the square , william miller approaches the contrite abigail patchett . newline newline   tis a miracle you were discovered by your uncle before you were corrupted by her wickedness ,  he manages after a long stuttering greeting . she nods all but imperceptibly , her blackened eyes cast downwards ,  perhaps with your uncle  s consent , i might see you to church on sunday so that you may be closer to him.  newline newline abigail nods again , tugging at her shawl as her lips curl upwards into a smile . newlinei stared him right in the eyes , unfocused on the jar . i was nt sure what he was going to do with it , but he had the intent to steal it . i could see it in his eyes . newline newline i stopped staring at him , and looked at the jar . i thought about the jar for a while . newline newline the jar had once contained jam from a festival i had gone to many a year back . i had washed out the jar once i arrived home , ridding it of the small portion remaining inside . newline newline this jar was used to contain pens for the entire workplace , but now it sits empty , on the table , right in front of me . newline newline i looked back at my opponent , and his glare tightened . he was nt blinking . i had shown weakness by avoiding eye contact , unintentionally . newline newline he suddenly grabbed the jar , and threw it upon the floor in what seemed to me like anger . newline newline i had made no notable effort to stop him , because i had known that the jar was nt a part of my anymore . it was nt my jar . it was the entire workplace s . newline newline the ceo of our office building walked in to see the glass jar , shattered upon the floor . newline newline my opponent was standing up . newline newline my opponent pointed at me , frantically trying to frame me , for whatever reason . i had no objections , but through unspoken contact , i could tell that the boss knew it was nt me due

with a promotion to vp of the company . newline newline all over a staring contest .franois tried to take a step away from the siege engine , and noticed his left foot was somehow stuck . looking down

up in this contraption of the devil newline newline the siege had been been going on for two weeks now , spiced up with the occasional launch of boulders . without these moments of excitement , there would be little to keep the men occupied while waiting for the occupants of the castle to eat through their reserves and then starve out . by seeing how things were going , the soldiers doubted that they would succeed in taking the castle , and as such , were nt as keen on taking chances since pillaging was an improbable reward . newline newline ferdinand gave his knife to his companion and looked around at the few siege engines facing the castle walls during this otherwise nice , quiet afternoon . the commander was about to give the order to launch the boulders , but there was no way they would let one of their own men be catapulted on the walls of an enemy castle . seeing how low the morale was , the commander had to be more careful than usual with his men in this land away from france fighting so le petit louis could win a pretty crown to wear on his noble head . newline newline so , the commander cursed at these two men while he waited for them to be able continue their duty . once they were ready , he gave the signal , and the boulders came crashing down on the castle walls . newline newline in time , they did breach the wall , and the english had to retreat to the inner walls of the fortress . in a completely unexpected turn of event , they ended up tunneling their way out and attacking from behind . thus , louis , the dauphin de france , lost what was later known as the first barons  war .day 1 :  newline the adrenaline rushed through my body as i fired at the terrorist trying to set the bomb . a headshot . hearing footsteps , i turned around and

feel any fear though , if i died i would just respawn . a silhouette appeared before me . i almost fired at him before realizing that he was one of my own . i checked my watch to see how many terrorists were remaining . only one . this will be boring . he could be hiding anywhere . searching is boring . i hit the quit  button on my watch . everything around me disappeared into darkness , the only light coming from my watch . i clicked   exit to life  .  are you sure ?  i was not sure , not sure at all . i remembered the adrenaline rush , the thrill , the very feeling of being alive . would i ever get to feel so alive in my real life ? i thought . i had been warned about this before using the machine . the desire of staying in the game forever . many people had been addicted to the machine . i despised them before , but i understand now . many had came out of their machines simply because someone had forced them to by removing their brain cords . the change in a person after using the machine was quite substantial . most of them seemed ghosts of their former selves . some even went mad . why would someone want to return to the mundane life anyway ? just one day more . so i hit no  and continued playing , killing the bastard terrorists . i was death incarnate . newline newline day 29 :  newline everything disappeared as i was about to pull the trigger . panic seized me

joe , remembering my old mundane life . why is someone calling me by that name ? i am not joe now . i am subzer0 , death incarnate for terrorists . i am not joe , joe is mundane . i am everything but

mundane again ! i wo nt !  i screamed at him . who was he , to do such a cruel thing to me ? he looked sad then .  so you bowed to the influence of the machine too ? i had hopes that you might resist

can easily ruin a mood if not carried right . i do enjoy the proclaimers , and i m sure my colleague s rendition on his guitar brings many people in heaven much joy , but to hear of the recent ban on

music they want  mostly anything that has the opportunity of pissing somebody else off and causing some huge fight . i mean , we re humans after all , right ? we should be able to fight if we damn well please . i ve been down here for three years now and have had at least one good fight a day , mostly with young women and children , but hey , they re protestants , they deserve to be here as much as i do . probably more so . newline newline one thing i overestimated in my thoughts of hell early on was the diversity of type here . i figured there would be muslims , jews , catholics , protestants , probably a buddhist , maybe one that set himself on fire without saying the proper prayer first , but it s mostly your average lutheran or methodist . they hate it here , let me tell you . too much drinking and enjoying the evils . these types , they still think they re doing god s work . i want to tell them , but it takes all the fun out of it . i think i might get a promotion soon , to chief hell kapo . see you at the christening . newline newline hell would easily get a fourandahalf rating  out of five  , simply for the amenities already set up . if you re angry , they give you someone to kill . if you re horny , they give you something to screw . if you re still devoted to god and want to continue praying , there s a cctv feed in on heaven to show you everything you do nt get because god does nt love you , really , and a plethora of lines lead you to the first two rooms . it s a good gig , great hard rock music , spicy mexican food . my racist uncle who i ve missed so much since he got the chair for killing a  black  is down here , so i get to visit him when he s not rampaging on all the african warlords . newline newline i know many of you are going to ask about the mormons , and let me tell you : the further you get , i mean the closest to the innermost circle , you start to see those who converted late , and those who married into the mormon church , but once you get inside  i went on one of those topless buses like in hollywood for all the stars  houses  there they are . all the mormons you ever thought existed , and more ! i could nt believe my eyes . and i should nt , since everything down here is a lie . but hey , what makes that so different than back home ? newline newline anyways , take a break , enjoy your mojito , and do nt worry about the afterlife . heaven , hell , what difference does it make ? at least here you have a good time .i smiled as a wandering traveler broke my reverie and general fingerdrumming , clanking his way into the shop with a sackful of goods to sell . newline newline  welcome ! looking to sell , friend ?  i asked . newline newline  indeed i am ! i ve many wondrous items that i think you ll appreciate , shopkeep ,  he replied . newline newline the traveler lay his sack down upon the countertop with a heavy thump , accompanied by the scrape of metalonmetal , and unfurled the sack with a little flourish . he set his hand upon the item furthest to his left and grinned . newline newline  this is the razor barb of orglak the slayer , a mighty orc chieftain in the higher steppes . it has claimed the lives of many brave warriors , and is imbued with arcane magic , so as never to lose its edge !  newline newline  marvelous !  i cried .  five gold pieces !  newline newline the traveler s face fell , and his jubilance was overcome by a brief look of incredulity . he cleared his throat , and move on to the next piece . newline newline  perhaps this shall strike your fancy , then : the helmet of ser roderic the brave , the most legendary knight in warriorking rothac s retinue ! you see , here , the gash borne by the axe of medathu the reviled , scourge of the seven planes  and these singe marks from rothornix , the black dragon . it is enchanted , much like the blade , to bestow unbridled courage to any man or woman that so dons it !  newline newline  my goodness , what a find !  i marveled , agape .  yes  yes , for this one , eight gold pieces , i think !  newline newline the traveler furrowed his brow , and it was clear that he felt slighted . newline newline  okay  okay , perhaps another piece , good sir ,  he declared , laying his hand upon a handmirror . newline newline  the mirror of princess gwedelyn , fairest maiden in the kingdom ! it is , perhaps , the most magically astounding artefact i ve ever beheld with mine own eyes , shopkeep . any man may look into its reflection and see before him the spirit of gwedelyn herself , fair and wise , and call upon her favor at a moment s notice ! you see , her lingering spirit has the power to   newline newline  say no more , friend !  i interrupted , beaming .  three gold pieces for this treasure !  newline newline the traveler slammed the mirror down on the countertop , nearly breaking it . he picked up his final piece , a grand longsword , into the hilt of which was carved an ornate , roaring griffon of gold , its haft encrusted with shimmering jewels . a faint blue aura permeated the blade , illuminating the dark and dusty room around us . a faint choir of heavenly voices could be heard in its presence . newline newline  right ,  he said , an undercurrent of annoyance in his voice .  this one , then . king redwayne s longsword , used to slay vedern the usurper , darkest wizard in all the land . any man that holds this sword in his possession is a nigh undefeatable warrior , destined to become the crowned monarch himself .  newline newline he peered at me expectantly , waving the sword around a little bit . newline newline  hm ,  i pondered , tapping my chin .  sorry , not interested in that one .  newline newline with an agonized shout , he rolled his sack back up and blundered out of the shop , swearing . newline newline  ah , certainly is a bull market ,  i murmured fondly .jessica . newline newline the name echoed through his mind , kicking up dust clouds of memories . a flash of smile and a glass of wine . a wrinkled nose at a bad joke . bobby pins on the sink . newline newline the scotch had a burnt and peaty flavor . it was nt his usual year  twelve instead of sixteen  but , it was good . another sip followed . a quick swirl . down the hatch it went . newline newline the snow was lazy , indifferent to the chaotic thoughts swirling , making it it impossible to focus . she slipped on her heels , sitting on the bed after a night out . he straightened his tie . they did nt kiss when they left his house . newline newline jessica . newline newline the name rang like a bell that could tease out their future together . he thought about how he would call her name from the kitchen , the smell of bacon wafting through the air . he would wrap his arms around her and kiss her deeply , drinking in her natural smell , mixed with faded perfume from the night before . newline newline  jessica .  he said aloud . a strong name  it fitted her like a white leather glove . sturdy , yet supple . she would have made a wonderful bride . perhaps an even better mother . newline newline with a plunk , he removed the stopper from the bottle of scotch and poured it into his glass . he contemplated for a moment , swallowed the liquor and poured another . newline newline jessica , he thought , so beautiful , but so flawed . she was a hurricane  fierce and unforgiving  utterly terrifying for those unprepared , but with a calm center . newline newline he tried to remember  to tease out why it was that things had fallen out of place . why it was that he could love her so furiously , but not stand being around her , being intoxicating in the worst way . newline newline she would nt tarnish her perfection with petty human flaws any more . no , he would remember her perfection  the stunning ideal . newline newline  james ?  a voice called , nearby . newline newline  yes , thomas ?  he was jessica s brother . newline newline  are you ready for the viewing ?  newline newline  no . i do nt think i will .  newline newline thomas would never understand . he would never know . newline newline james got exactly what he wanted ... newline newline ... and nobody would ever be the wiser . newline newline newline newlinenewline  would you kill a man if we asked you to ?  newline newline  i  m sorry , what ?  newline newline  would you kill a man if we asked you to.  newline newline  is this joneswayright ?  in response , one of them turned around to the wall behind them , where the answer to my question was plastered loud and clear . i looked at the two of them in confusion , then down at my wrist watch . sure enough , it was eleventhirty , my scheduled time for the job interview . newline newline  answer the question.  newline newline the appropriate response here is for me to say no . of course i would never kill a man ! but sometimes , life is boring , so let  s play their game until we reach the breaking point . if anything , i could hide somewhere in bali for the rest of my life . at least that  s more exciting than a shitty soulsucking existence in the cubicle they showed me earlier . newline newline  yes . who  s the lucky man ?  the two men across the table from me looked at each other with smiles . newline newline  it  s our boss.  newline newline  what  d he do , screw your wives ?  it was meant to throw them off , but surprisingly , they roared with laughter . newline newline i had no idea what was going on , but i continued their game . newline newline  mark , this guy  s got some balls ... that  s none of your concern , kid . we got the money and we get to choose who to hire . we just changed the job responsibilities around a bit.  newline newline  how much are you paying me ?  i tried to sound confident . newline newline  the annual salary you saw in the job description.  newline newline  double it ,  i say without missing a beat . they whisper in each other  s ears , and looked at me impressively . newline newline  sure . but only if you don  t make too big of a mess , and you do it within five minutes of him walking into the room.  newline newline  what do you mean ?  the one on the left glanced at his wristwatch . newline newline  he  s going to walk in when we ask him . do what you can , but please be tidy about it . we don  t like stained carpets.  one of them pulls out a briefcase , sets it on the table facing me , and opens it to reveal stacks of cash . it easily could have been four times the annual salary in there . newline newline holy shit , these guys are serious . bali is looking nice about now . newline newline  uh , yeah , i can manage.  newline newline several of the longest , sweatdrenched , anxietyinducing minutes of my life later newline newline a rotund , balding man walks into the room . he sits at the head of the table . god i hope he doesn  t notice my intense shaking . being nervous during job interviews is never a good thing . newline newline  what is joneswayright ?  newline newline  uhhh , a financial ccompany , one of the wealthiest , that duhdeals in private ehequity.  they could barely understand . i notice one of them look at their wristwatch and back at me , as if pushing me . my heart is pounding out of my chest , i wonder if they notice the breast of my suit pumping abnormally . newline newline the boss smiles back at me .  on the surface , yes . so you  re telling me , you have no clue ?  newline newline  nno ?  newline newline  we   newline newline bang ! newline newline the boss topples backwards in his executive chair with a hole in his forehead . newline newline  mark , what the fuck.  newline newline  i was tired of his shiteating grin.  he put the revolver back inside his suit jacket . newline newline  we set up the perfect opportunity to test this guy   newline newline  look at him , he looks like he just seen a ghost for christ  s sake . he wasn  t gon na do it.  newline newline  ah , poor kid . what

newline newline newlinethe judge looked at me as if he had stumbled upon something so horrific and strange that the sight would leave himself completely stupefied for the rest of his life . but i did nt relent . newline newline  your honor , as i was saying my client s intellectual property rights were violated when hdcreations inc. , decided not to contribute the work to mr. shawns and decided to back from their price for settlement as agreed .  newline newline i took a deep breath , and raised my right hand . the rattling eyes gazed at me from its fabric covered head . i cleared my throat and found the right higher pitch . newline newline  i object , your honor ! the settlement , mentioned by mr. shawns  attorney , is a fabrication and further documentation clearly shows that mr. shawns was commissioned for his work and does not have any legal right to contribution .  newline newline as i was about to retort , the judge s gavel hammered with the intent to kill . newline newline  will you and ... your sock ! ... please approach the bench ! it was dark and silent in the bedroom when she woke . the phone charging on the bedside table was quiet , still too early for the alarm . she looked at the clock , laid crooked next to the phone . she stretched her hands across the cotton gulf next to her on the bed . the dreams had been good , but waking only brought nostalgia and loneliness . the red numbers ran . newline newline when the chirp of the alarm finally pulled her up , she sat stuck on the side . feet dangled towards the floor : small , cold things . the carpet looked the same as it had the day before . her bladder was not enough to move her , until the alarm sounded again . newline newline as she pulled on the sports bra , she shuffled slowly across the hall . the first smudge of dawn reddened the sky outside the bathroom window , though it felt gloaming . the toilet seat was where she left it . the seat was cold . she let the lid fall and winched at the sudden hollow noise . newline newline strewn next to the capless toothpaste , she pushed through the identical pile to find the perfect hair band . she avoided seeing the reflection of the bags under her eyes and the hollowness of her cheeks as she pulled a ponytail . she couldn  t avoid seeing the redness contrasting her pale irises . newline newline the third stair creaked and the fourth squeaked as she padded down to the living room . she reached for her running shoes and carried them down the hall . the coffee pot was cold and empty . she walked back to the hall and looked up and down . the rooms here were all dark . newline newline she sat on the front porch , pulling on each shoe . the streetlight was still on across the culdesac , backlit by a sky growing orange . she moved down to the street . turning left and right she looked for any signs of life , but there were none . she adjusted the apps on her phone and pushed in her earphones . she started her morning jog . newline newline the music didn  t stop the memories of him . newline fall back !  newline newline bullets and mortar shells , throwing fissures of dirt and snow into the air , flew over the heads of the fifty odd paratroopers huddled on the far side of bastogne . the german panzers had slowly pushed them back into the town over the past two days , reclaiming more and more land from the exhausted americans . lt. westbrook popped out from behind a small shack and fired off a burst from his submachine gun , tagging a german in the shoulder . he felt the gun click empty and reached for another magazine and grimaced as his hand hit empty air . he turned from the shack , sprinted across a fallow cornfield , diving over the low rock wall that what was left of bravo was hiding behind . newline newline  anyone got a mag ?  he said , turning around to face the advancing huns . newline newline  nope lieutenant  newline newline  sorry lt.  newline newline  ran out five minutes ago lieutenant  newline newline  well shit !  westbrook said as he slung the tommy over his back and drew his nine millimeter . newline newline  fall back !  newline newline westbrook looked down the line and saw captain morris , the leader of bravo , backing towards the tree line , about fifty yards away . confused paratroopers looked as their captain slowly abandoned the fight . newline newline  stay here !  westbrook ordered , sprinting towards his captain  and keep firing !  he reached captain morris and nearly tackled him to the ground , getting him out of the line of fire . newline newline  captain , why are we retreating ?  westbrook screamed , wondering what the hell was going through his head . newline morris looked at westbrook , wild eyes startling the lieutenant  we  re going to get overwhelmed , we  ve lost connection with easy company , we  re all going to die !  newline newline westbrook slowly realized what had happened . morris had been awake for the past five days , nearly 120 hours without sleep . westbrook grabbed his crazed captain and pulled him back towards the safety of the stone wall . even though the captain wasn  t thinking straight , running across that open ground was near suicide , he did have a point . bravo was close to the breaking point , running low on ammunition and taking an increasing number of casualties . westbrook scanned the firefight , looking for a way to save his men . the rock wall they were behind looped around this section of bastogne if they could follow it and get away from these germans , maybe they could fall back into the forest . newline newline  first sergeant martin !  westbrook called . within seconds , a burly man with a tangled reddish beard dropped down next to him.  we  re moving down this wall hopefully find a point close enough to the forest to make a break for it . with any luck jerry won  t follow us . i want you to take what  s left of first platoon with our at rockets and stop any tanks that follow us.  newline newline  what about captain morris ?  newline newline  we  ll deal with that can of worms later , right now , just move !  newline newline bravo leapt into action , the fifteen or so men left in first platoon taking up firing positions once again , defending their retreating comrades . the germans , seeing the retreating americans starting edging forward , cautious , awaiting an american trap . once they realized there were just fifteen yanks holding the line though , the slow trickle of an advance turned into a flood . first platoon held valiantly for as long as they could , turning grim german war machines into smoking husks , living men into corpses . eventually they followed the rest of their company back along the wall , towards the safety of the forest . newline newline bravo moved through the forest for most of the night , retreating for miles into the dense canopy of evergreens and barren trees . they had lost an additional ten men in their holding actions with the germans , bringing the total number of men down to forty . easy was hopefully still defending the town and all the wounded but there was no way to be sure . for all they knew , these forty men were the last of bravo company . they set up a bivouac around a small copse of trees and for the first time in five days slept . they didn  t even set a watch . newline newline westbrook woke to screaming . he immediately bolted up , completely awake , drawing his pistol . the rest of the platoon had roused themselves as well and were pointing their weapons into the dark woods . it was still night out , probably around 0100 in the morning . he looked around the group . newline newline  who  s screaming ?  westbrook said . no one came forward . newline newline  so no one here screamed ?  he asked again , looking for any response in the faces of the soldiers . newline newline  well that is a load of bull  he said  we  re all awake and there  s no one else around  newline newline a rather bulky corporal by the name of pyle stepped forward from the group of soldiers . despite his bulk and ineffectiveness in combat he was beloved by the troops for his quirky sense of humor and demeanor . newline newline  well sir , it  s possible that.  newline pyle never got to finish what he was going to say before a flash of bright blue light engulfed the corporal . he screamed the most bonechilling scream that westbrook ever could have imagined , higher than any human voice should be able to go . everyone took an involuntary step back , eyes fixed on the smoking boots that was all that were left of corporal pyle . newline newline  what the  westbrook started before another one of his soldiers burst into blue flame and then another then another . the paratroopers broke , plain and simple , they threw down their weapons and ran like rabbits from a hound . westbrook decided to make it an order as well . newline newline  run !  he screamed at the top of his lungs , pulling up anyone that had decided to ignore the events of the night and continue sleeping .  just run ! get out of here ! go !  when the man he was pulling out of a foxhole exploded he decided it was time to leave himself . newline newline he dodged through the trees , dropping the thompson and his rucksack , anything to get away faster . he heard those other worldly screams behind him as he sprinted through the dense wood . he risked a look back only to see a bright ball of blue flame ignite behind him . it  s amazing what a man under stress can do . lieutenant westbrook ran faster than he ever had before . until he found a small cliff to fall off of . he took another large step only to find empty space instead of snow and rock . he tumbled over the cliff , hitting rocks and tree trunks , sliding through the snow until he reached the bottom , feeling as if he had just come out of a boxing match . he painfully lifted his head from the snow he had fallen into only to fall deep into unconsciousness . newline newline he felt heat . westbrook slowly opened his eyes , blinking the snow and dried blood out . he craned his head up and saw a floating ball of blue fire , just three feet in front of him . a long vine of blue flame extended from the ball , poised to strike the injured lieutenant like a viper . newline newline  please  westbrook said , raising his arm in a gesture of mercy . newline newline the blue flame struck . newlineimmediately during the attempt to cook , jim realized he needed level 18 cooking and thought to himself  oh crap i ve gotten only level 10 .  jim was a total noob who was straight off tutorial island from previous day , but this was no problem . he remembered how to catch shrimp . promptly after , he used the home teleport where he arrived there in just 30 seconds later . after this he spent the next 4 hours catching raw shrimp just to burn them on a fire near by because it was only made from oak logs in combination with his low cooking level . however , he did nt give up and at level 15 cooking attempted to speed up the grind by trying to  borrow gp  from his friend after claiming he was  scammed in a trade gone wrong .  but for some reason his trade option would nt work . he then spent all the time on cooking raw shrimp until he hit level 18 . it was at this point jim realized if he ever wanted to make it in life it would be too difficult because he was created as an ironman .in a cold and dirty gas station bathroom , florescent lights glared down on a young waifish woman sitting on a toilet with her knees tucked under her chin and her bony arms wrapped around her shins . newline newline she rocked gently back and forth , doing her best to muffle her cries into the collar of her well worn , churchappropriate woolen dress . it was long enough to hide the scars and bruises of years of abuse , but not quite enough to mask the heartwrenching sobs escaping from her 14 year old body . newline newline clutched tightly in her right hand was a small plastic item , three inches wide and as thick a stick of beef jerky . it glistened in the harsh and unforgiving lights coming from above her . newline newline finally , when she d wept all the tears she had to weep , and with the aid of exhaustion and hopelessness , her hand relaxed enough to allow the plastic stick to slip from her grasp . it hit the notoftenenoughmopped tile with what sounded in her heart like a gunshot . newline newline landing on the ground faceup , there was one word on the small readout   pregnant .  newline newline she knew that her father , the pastor of their church would punish her for this . not with his hands , or what was inside of his pants and not with the belt or even the switch . newline newline no ... this time he d use the knife , and this time she knew she would nt wake up the morning after .it becomes maddening when no one talks with you . they ll talk near me , at me , around me or through me ,

myself losing my grip on reality . but did i ever have a real grip anyways ? could i tell anyone what my is happening to me ? would they understand ? should they care ? newline newline faint echoes , memories of all the pasts i ve shared with them constantly bubble below the surface . there are so many things i long to know , to ask , but will never find out . it s not my place to ask for the

and yell . how could she forget about the obscenities he s done . the flirting , the hating , the lying , the cheating , and especially the drugs . after she heard that , she zoned out . the five minutes she gave him were supposed to help , at least in her mind . now what s left of their relationship is probably destroyed . newline newline newline it was nt her fault , though . he changed .

newline water swirled inexorably , blanketing the sky in a heavy , ominous grey . newline newline this is sealing , child . it s a very dangerous art .  newline newline thunder crashed . lightning

newline a single mistake , the slightest stroke in a wrong direction and you ll face dire consequences . but it is a powerful magic .  newline newline you can accomplish almost anything for equivalent risk , even part the barriers between soul and body , life and death . you can even defeat that demon that threatens our lands , that dark emperor , given enough time and preparation .  newline newline his blades hung in his hands , gleaming with eldritch energy even in the low light . newline newline is that how you lost your eye ? sealing ?  newline newline the village was burning , the roofs collapsing on themselves as electricity morphed into a wave of blue , cold fire . the rain splashed on , unhindered . newline newline the pale doll looked up at him from where it stood amidst the flames , seals dripping from its form in an inky morass that creeped slowly across the ground . its face was undamaged . he recognized that pale smile . he recognized those dark , strangely luminescent eyes . newline newline eldritch energy poured forth from her form , spilling out into the air in an invisible pressure . he could feel reality warping around her , the world cracking from her very existence and forming strange spatial distortions around her slight , slender form . he was nt surprised that she could sustain such an effect . newline newline she was his precious student after all , once a human with such a potential for manipulating the words of the world that her abilities could exceed even high ranking kami given the chance . newline newline yes , my eye was lost because of seals . no , do nt worry ... it s the least of consequences , really .  newline newline he held his blades up , crossing them before his chest . he drew in a breath , time dilating in his

forearm . her form reared back as seals of rot spread from his splintered wrist onto her skin . newline newline you must never attempt to place seals on yourself . you must nt practice without my supervision . it s too dangerous .  newline newline she shrieked , twisting . her body erupted , a newer form bursting out of her corrupted flesh like a molt . her new form was covered in seals , curses swirling and churning across the surface of her skin an onto the air . she charged at him , finger bones erupting into foot long claws . chains of words shot out at him from the ground , disgusting filthy words coated in poison and death and time . newline newline more people die with every day that i delay , with every additional test i perform . more people die because of me .  newline newline he lunged to the side , tripping her with a feint . his blades worked in tandem , swiping her claws in a whirl before he stabbed at her once more . newline newline i swear to you , i have your best intentions at heart . i intend to keep you safe .  newline newline his body burned , his muscles collapsing and fracturing as he moved . he tasted blood in his mouth . his own seals were eating into him just as they were eating into her still . the monster possessing her body thought it had gotten rid of his seals through its molt , but the curses had settled deep inside its bones already . newline newline i will help you defeat all the evil in this land because you are my beloved child .  newline newline he struck out , uncaring , his hands dripping ink as the skin and flesh was cannibalized to fuel his speed and strength . his blades flashed as they met her claws , cutting and disintegrating as the nullification seals activated . newline newline she seized him by the throat , screaming . lightning coursed down from the sky , intending to strike him , flowing around his form as he brought his blades up again . newline newline the metal fractured and snapped , scattering golden fragments across the mud and earth . white fire flared around him as he burnt himself up to keep fighting , a selfmade conflagration , a penance maybe , he was nt sure anymore . newline newline will you smile if i manage to seal the emperor ?  newline newline he yelled his defiance , charging forward anyway , grabbing her by the neck . her seals crept up his arms , consuming their physical forms . he held on anyway , his form sustained by word and will alone . newline newline they were burning . it was all burning . even the rain was burning now , hissing in his purifying fire . the emperor , the dark presence sitting in her soul , was writhing in the flames . newline newline her reason seemed to return briefly , her lips parting with a question . newline newline will you smile , like you used to ?  newline newline  yes ,  he whispered to her , a smile on lips that were swept away by the wind and flame . newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinei have

newline newline and something is running closer . and he  no , it  looks hungry . newline newline this creature looked like a man , except for bright yellow eyes with no iris . this creature was taller than me , with sharp claws and , as it drew closer , i could what smelled like rotting flesh coming off of him . i realized , to my horror , that the body was nt actually alive . newline newline this is why the sent the missile . to kill this thing . newline newline i could not run . so i searched for a weapon . a soldier caught in the blast had left several weapons  so i tried using guns on the beast . surprisingly , it actually slowed down the creature  despite what the movies tell you , bullets hurt , even when you re undead , apparently . the beast eventually crumpled on the floor . was it dead ? newline newline refusing to take a chance , i began to gather a machete and a nearby flamethrower . i reached some grenades , then i noticed the creature stirring . newline newline and then the creature was right in front of me . it had jumped several feet in one bound . with my heart beating wildly in my chest , i turned the flamethrower on the creature . the beast screamed , but the heat from the flames singed me , and i realized soon the heat would harm me more than it . newline newline inwardly , i despaired . i was fighting a monster that wore a dead man s body , how could i kill what was already dead ? suddenly , an idea struck me . perhaps i could use the foul beasts nature against it . newline newline i turned off the flamethrower and walked as quickly as my lungs would let me to the nearest house , hoping to my god that the house had what i needed . i heard the creature make a sound through it s rotting lungs that i assumed was laughter . it thought i was trying to hide . i was laying a trap . i went into the kitchen , took out my machete , and turned around . newline newline the monster stood there , smiling . i placed my machete high in the air , and then yelled out a war cry as i began to fight for my life . newline newline the monster , in turn , fought me . it s razor sharp claws attempted to rip at my face . i dodged each blow with my machete , searching for an opening to hack at the beast . finally , i cut off one of its right arm . the creature stared in shock as the limb fell with a sickeningly soft sound . i tried to use the distraction to hack at the other arm , but the monster backhanded me , with a rageful howl . newline newline i laid on the floor , with blood in my vision . despite my pain , i could nt rest now , i was so close . i used my new position to hack his feet off . suddenly losing its footing , the creature gave me enough time to get up and cut off its other arm . as the creature lay there , limbless and impotent , i immediately went to the next part of my plan , emptying the freezer of the kitchen . and then i felt an arm throwing me into the kitchen sink . newline newline the monster could use its limbs , even when apart . i heard the faucet bing turned , and my head was soon submerged under water . newline newline unfortunately for it , i could nt drown . i tore the monster s hands off of me , and threw into the freezer . i then threw the rest of the body in there , set the freezer to its coldest measure , and closed the door on the snarling beast . newline newline around 20 minutes later , i hesitantly peeked in the door . the creature was frozen in an eternal snarl . as i had planned , even an undead monster is still in a dead body . i remember science class mentioning that dead bodies would freeze in the cold weather , so zombies would desiccate in winter . i thanked my god that a freezer was close enough to winter to work . newline newline however , i was still not in the clear . i still had to find other people , and convince i was not the beast , and hope they would nt shoot me anyway . i was also troubled by something even worse . the people in charge of maintaining refrigeration systems and electricity were most likely killed in the bombing . which means that eventually , that freezer would thaw out . and then the monster would reawaken . newline newline when that happens , even if i could run , there will no place safe for me to go . newline newlinethe old house had caught fire so quickly the night before and burnt down even faster . it was nothing but ash and smoldering logs now . no one bothered calling the fire department  it was just an abandoned house sitting in the middle of nowhere . it was in a small town located south of the city near the hills . newline newline a young teen age girl was lying face down on the ground among the rubble motionless . her bright red hair was knotted and spread around her . as she began to regain consciousness she tried to move . her muscles hurt like she had been beaten with clubs . her lungs ached from all the smoke last night . slowly she propped herself up . she had nt felt this bad since she ran away from the crazy cult group her parents were in . her light green eyes were watery as she opened them to check for injuries . it was still dark outside . newline newline she quickly looked herself over and then remembered she wouldn  t be burned ever again . with a slight smile and a wince she stood up . someone might come to check out the remains of the house . none of her artwork survived the fire , unfortunately . the only thing that was safe from a fire is whatever she is touching . lucky for her she always kept her money tucked away in her shoe . newline newline she quickly headed for the woods behind the house  s remains , trying not to trip or fall as she clumsily worked her way into the grove . after a while she stopped and listened to make sure no one was around , then held up her hand palm up , allowed a little flame to ignite , and was able to find a clearing she could use until the sun came out . newline newline after building a fire she sat and practiced controlling the flames . her parents called her ember because of her red devil hair . she finally liked the name that tormented her throughout her childhood . ember thought it fit her power nicely , but she would not be evil . she would use it for good , once she could control it . she had made a promise to her little sister . she never breaks a promise . newline newline newlinemrs.

dragonborn . you must defeat the one called smaug .  newline newline middleearth is a strange place . the elves and men do nt interact , and they ve never heard of argonians or khajiit . this is a far

hardly believe it ! dwemer were still alive ! they had vanished from skyrim centuries ago , but here they were . when the people of skyrim hear this , they will flock to this faroff place . follow the dwaves and i will find the dragon . newline newline my journey led me to a place called laketown . aptly named , it is a town built on top of a lake . the town was burning with dragon fire when i saw it from the far shore . the beast could be seen flying above the town wreaking havoc with its fire . i made my way across the lake to battle the creature . newline newline i ran across the burning planks toward the beast . i did not feel the flames , as my armor was made from the bones of vanquished dragons . my deadra waraxe in hand and shield in the other , i used my throw voice  shout to get

newline newline  i m from the land of skyrim , and i am the dovahkiin .  newline newline  dragonborn !  smaug reared his head back and let out a gout of flame . i used my frost breath to stop the blaze . if this place took anymore fire damage , it would collapse into the water .  so , the old foe of the dragon s has come to slay me at last . no matter . i can not be beaten . not by you , nor by dwarves , nor any other man !  he flapped his giant wings and rose high into the air . newline newline  you re not getting away that easily , smaug ,  i said . i took a deep breath .  joorzahfrul !  dragonrend escaped my lips and shot toward smaug . the spell hit the dragon full in the chest . he roared as the shout enveloped him and he came crashing down .  we end this here , smaug . the age of dragons is over . alduin is dead by my hand and you re all that s left .  newline newline smaug struggled to get up .  alduin . dead ?  he let out a laugh .  i m ten times stronger than he ever was . let me show you !  the dragon roared and snapped at me with his swordlike teeth . i raised my shield and bashed it against his snout . his head flung off the the side and i brought my axe down on his neck , like i ve killed countless other dragons before . it glanced off his armor with only a dent . i jumped back in surprise as smaug laughed again .  impressive technique , dragonborn . you re stronger than you seem . but it will not be enough .  he swiped his massive claw at me and sent me flying . i crashed in a heap on the ground . he hit harder than a giant after i messed with his mammoth .  as i ve told others before , i can not be harmed . my armor is iron !  newline newline  oh yeah ,  i said as i got up .  well , my armor is your mother !  i must have surprised him , either by getting up or the insult , because he did nt move as i rushed toward him . i swung my axe down with a powerful blow to the same spot on his neck . with a sound like metal being torn apart , my axe cut through his armor . he reared up on his back legs in pain , screeching . i noticed a bare patch on his chest , but it was out of my reach .  fusrodah !  my shout caused smaug to stagger back and lose his balance . he fell on his back and i jumped up onto his exposed chest . i ran to the bare patch and , with a powerful strike , sunk my axe into the exposed flesh . smaug let out one last roar and fell silent . i felt the last dragon soul being absorbed into my body . with only the skeletal remains of smaug remaining , i began my journey back to skyrim .manuel was by all accounts a good man . he was courteous to his neighbors , paid his bills on time and was a rather pleasant person to be around . it was nt a surprise to any of his friends that he volunteered to give up his traits , it

newline eventually the expected time of manuel s death came . he was surrounded by stranger and hooked up to a hospital bed , machines beeping and watching him every step of the way , but manuel was nt troubled . manuel just smiled his little smile one last time , and breathed his last . newline newline a man by his side began to shake uncontrollably , quaking with laughter . a woman howled with anger and punched her wife , the wife did nt particularly notice , she did nt even seem to care . in minutes all the volunteers were in one form of distress or the other , and had to be removed from the premises . newline newline you see manuel was nt as perfect as people thought he was , he was actually a rather volatile mixture . manuel was however a sum of his parts , only functioning because

many layers of thick parka . her footsteps crunched in the snow as she walked along , weaving between the lifeless trees of the winter . although she had walked in the forest many times , her mind still glowed with an intense fear of getting lost . she tried to divert those thoughts , to keep her mind on normal highschool things like school and friends and homework . it was hard , and only made worse by the knowledge of where she was headed . newline newline after about five minutes of walking , she stopped at the edge of a circular clearing in the woods . here , the snow was spotted black and carved by many footprints . the girl sat down and watched as the sun rose steadily through the trees . it was nt long before she heard the crunching of another pair of feet in the snow . she looked in their direction and set her eyes on a middle aged woman in a grey sweater stumbling towards the clearing . the girl rose to her feet and approached the woman with both hands buried deep in her pockets . newline newline  hello  the girl called . this was always her greeting . newline newline  hi  the women replied . as she walked closer , the girl noticed deep lines in the women s face . her eyes had been on the ground ever since she came into view , and her walk was really more of a shuffle . when the girl and the women were close enough to touch eachother , they both stopped and looked at eachother . a minute of silence passed , then the women spoke .  is it true ? ,  she asked , her eyes returning to the icy floor .  i ve heard that it is , but it just seems to absurd to be real . i feel silly ... i feel like this is some big prank , and i m just so silly to believe in it all .  she paused for a moment , trying to hold back the tears clouding her eyes .  i just ... i just need this to be real , i m so desperate , i ca nt sleep at night with him gone .  newline newline the girl was quiet for a moment as the women gathered herself . the women sniffled once or twice , and then silence was restored . finally , the girl spoke .  do you have a picture ?  newline newline the women nodded and produced a small polaroid from her sweater s pocket . she handed it to the girl .  this was from a month before the accident .  she added , as the girl held the photo in her small , pale hands . newline newline the girl eye s scanned the picture from top to bottom . the subject was a small boy with bright , blonde hair and a toddler s smile . he could nt have been older than 5 . the boy stood in the front yard of a small house . the grass was littered with toys . newline newline  are you ready ? ,  the girl finally asked , looking up from the picture . the women slowly nodded . the girl drew in a deep breath , then exhaled a hot cloud of air onto the photograph . immediately , the corners of the picture began to twist and squirm . newline newline the girl dropped the photo onto the cold snow and watched as it twitched . the women , both fearful and curious , stepped closer and peered down at image . it was growing . newline newline slowly , something began to rise from the blurry snapshot in the snow . it was shadowy , with lines of color streaking down it . the women took a step back . the mass rose up and up until it was about 3 feet off the ground . then it began to expand . at first lumpy , it gradually gained definition . its shades of black quickly gave way to vivid colors , and within seconds the image was complete . where the photograph had been planted there now stood a little boy . newline newline for a long moment , the women was stoic . her eyes denied what was before her . this was nt yet reality to her mind . it was insanity . then , out of either strange acceptance or blatant denial , she embrached the small figure . she rapped both arms around the boy and began to cry happy tears . she squeezed him in a hug , and for a moment she was happy beyond words . the feeling did nt last . newline newline suddenly , the women recoiled . she had felt something off about the boy . he had almost felt ... hollow . then denial returned , and she attempted to talk to the boy . it was her boy , she told herself . she uttered his name . there was no response . the boy simply beamed , his lips spread to show his brilliant smile . his eyes never left the womens face . newline newline she called his name again . no response . again . no response . she wanted to shake the little kid , to get something out of him besides that smile . fear was rising in the back of her mind . newline newline the women turned to

largely empty tables . she was tough as an old school hilux , and twice as rugged , yet even she would nt look big bob in the eye as she passed . newline he was the meanest motherfucker this side of coober pedy . nobody messed with bob . newline he slammed his drink down . newline newline  trace !  he bellowed  anutha thanks luv  newline newline tracy nodded  coming bob  before hurrying off to fetch the man s drink , not eager to keep the volatile giant waiting . newline newline big bob had already put down one bloke early that morning , with a king hit that clean snapped the poor bastard s

see their drinks shiver . it was a loud crack , followed by the roar of a powerful motorcycle drawing closer , that most caught people s attention . newline newline as the roar died down tenants began turning their eyes to dusty bar s door , curious about the new arrival . they did nt have to wait long . newline newline the thick oak door flew open , little bell ringing to announce the presence of this newest guest . within its frame , silhouetted by the nearly risen sun , stood a tall , stocky woman clad fully in black leather . her dark hair was shaped into a short mohawk , a wicked scar

newline newline  ohh wrong move fatso  newline newline the woman sighed as she spoke , then put her hand over big bob s own and pulled it across her chest and with her other hand , slammed bob s face into the counter . newline newline even as the gargantuan specimen of a man slid to the floor , the imprint of his face clearly and forever defined upon the bench , the woman stepped off her stool .

of the engine ceased . the click of the lights slowed , and the silence began to creep in . major tom s hands rose from his lap and floated in the zero gravity . earth lay behind him , and eternity

radio spoke once more .  tom , it s time to the leave the capsule . if you dare .  newline newline major tom looked to the circular hatches at the rear of the cockpit . through the hatch window he could see the rounded horizon of earth and the total darkness showing beyond . he opened the first hatch and closed it behind him , only one piece of metal door separated him from the vacuum of space . he secured the tether to his harness and attached the air his to his pack . the hiss of oxygen greeted him and stabilized  there were no leaks . newline newline he opened the hatch and eternity opened before him . he keyed his radio . newline newline  major tom to ground control . i m stepping through the door . and i m floating in a most peculiar way .  his feet left the deck of the ship

brighter than anyone had ever seen .  and the stars look very different today .  newline newline as he drifted he was suddenly struck with a deep sense of melancholy . he looked down upon the earth and all of its inhabitants busy with their lives , and he was all alone . newline newline  for here , am i sitting in my tin can . far above the world . planet earth is blue , and there s nothing i

moon slide into view beneath him . soon , it too was receding behind as his vessel left earth orbit . newline newline he calmed his breathing as he looked forward into the brilliant sky ablaze with distant stars . he keyed the radio and spoke once more . newline newline  major tom to ground control .  there was mostly static , but ground control sounded from a distance .  go ahead , tom .  newline newline  though i m past one hundred thousand miles , i m feeling very still . and i think my spaceship knows which way to go .  newline newline the static sounded for a minute .  ground

... .  newline newline newline man ca nt tell you how many times i wanted to do that in high school .  not going to be apologist i fully acknowledge it s a racist book , but what a love story i was awoken from my daze by my friend , austin , shaking me hard . the first thing i saw was a spoon two inches from my face . the soup i had just scooped from the bowl in front of me had spilled from the spoon and onto the table . i turned my head slowly to look at austin . his hand was still on my shoulder and he had a very confused and concerned look on his face . he signed  are you okay ?  to me . i squinted at him and gave a half nod as i put my spoon back into the bowl of soup that was probably cold by now . i began frantically looking around the diner we were sitting in . all i heard now was silence , but i could swear that i had heard a muffled giggle . a laugh . i had heard something . newline newline it had been 6 years since i woke up one morning unable to hear . honestly , the sleep i had woken up from that morning had been the best night s sleep i had experienced since i was a child . austin , my best friend since the first grade , had gone with my mom and i to the doctor . in fact , he went with me to all the doctor appointments as we tried to figure out what was causing this seemingly inexplicable anomaly . the doctors ran every test in the book , but came up with nothing . the first year sucked , a lot . but austin was there for me every step of the way , even learning sign language with me . newline newline i looked at every person in the diner . i focused on their faces , their mouths mainly . almost everyone s was moving . their lips forming words that i would never hear . their vocal chords vibrating at frequencies that my ear drums would never pick up . i saw random words being mouthed : love , pizza , mom , remodel . but i could nt hear any of them . then i heard the laugh again . newline newline my head whipped sharply to the left , almost spraining my neck . it came from the doorway . there was a girl , probably around 26 years old , walking out of the diner , using her back to push the door open . her long brown hair obscured her face until she shook it away , revealing a beautiful smile on her lips as she looked down at her smartphone . i got out of my chair immediately and tried to push my way past the tightly packed tables and the people who were leaving or being seated . i assume austin was yelling out for me , but i would nt hear it anyway , and i would nt have stopped if i did . i still had my eye on the girl , and , just before the door closed , i heard the laugh again . her face lit up more than before , if that was at all possible , as her mouth opened in a  ha !  i heard it , loud and clear , and it came , unmistakably , from her mouth . newline newline i was only halfway to the door . austin and i had decided to sit in the back of the diner that day because the cold autumn wind came in the door each time it was opened by a patron . it felt like forever , but i finally made my way through the crowd and reached the door . i pushed it open and immediately felt the brisk october chill wash over me . my coat was still draped , forgotten , over the back of my chair . the wind and cold air did nt faze me , though , as i frantically searched for the girl and her bright purple pea coat . i spotted her quickly in the sea of black and tan jackets . she was just about to step off the sidewalk to cross the street to the next block . i ran after her but got caught up by a group of businessmen about to walk into the diner i had just escaped from . newline newline when i got past them , i managed to catch sight of her across the street and was just about to start running towards her once again when i felt a hand on my arm . i turned around , about to give this annoying person a hell of a tellingoff , and realized it was austin . he was looking at me with that same concerned and confused look . i ignored him once again and turned back to look for the girl , but she was gone . i walked further ahead then stopped , resigned that i would never see her again . i looked back at austin , who had followed me those few further steps . he urged me to take my coat and i noticed he had put his on hastily , the collar was half inside and half out . he immediately signed  what s wrong ? what did you see ?  i put on my coat in a slightly annoyed fashion , probably sporting an angry look on my face . he cocked his head to the right and signed  what s wrong ?  again . newline newline i did nt know how to explain the last few moments to him . it was bizarre ... and exhilarating at the same time . i felt amazing from the adrenaline in me , but also severely depressed that it may have been some kind of hallucination . no ... i heard her laugh . i know i did . but how ?he knew he was called here . he knew what he had to do to leave . all he had to do was figure out who d called him as worthy to bear them . newline newline his gaze brushed past an ancient lance , its head wet with blood and water even as the rest of it had gathered dust over the ages . scenes flashed into his mind briefly , followed by a sense of regret that was not his own . not yours . i m sorry .  newline newline so he moved on . all the weapons whispered , he d noticed gradually , but only so faintly as to be inaudible unless you listened , or they spoke in unison . he knew he was called here by something in this hall , because he had to be . a weapon could not be held by someone unworthy , and someone worthy could not resist being called to claim their weapon . and thus he was stuck . newline newline until he had a better idea , he took in the polearms surrounding him . a hopeful look at an impossibly balanced spear  not yours , i m sorry  before his hopes were dashed  that would have been useful for entertainment , at least . he grimaced at the spear that split into thirty points , though . few uses for that , except suffering . not yours .  newline newline as he moved on to the swords , he paused . a single whisper had grown stronger , and he quickened his pace in response to seek it out . he was getting closer newline newline the instant he set his sights on it , he knew many things . this was the sword that had called him , its visions were unlike all the rest . visions not of the past , but of the future it would have with him . scenes of fire and blood , promises of power and sadistic torture . it offered no remorse with its visions , only a sort of thrill . newline newline he turned away sharply , trying and failing to convince himself of some mistake , that he d only gazed too long on it without noticing . desperately , he focused on the other artifacts nearby . not yours . i m sorry . not yours . i m sorry . not yours . i m sorry .  newline newline he stopped for a long while and thought . he could nt look at it again , but he knew it was there , waiting for him to claim it . it had called him , after all . he was the one worthy to claim it , and he would be free as soon as he did . newline newline looking at the weapon that had called him here , brushing past its horrific images and taking in its dusty appearance contrasting the fine weapons around , he began to smile .  alright ,  he said ,  i ll accept it . you called me , i have no other choice for weapon than you .  newline newline standing up , he continued ,  but i still have a choice .  and as every worthy person had before him , he turned away and left the hall .it s funny in a way that should nt be .  his flock  the people are pushing and shoving , trying to get to the front of the crowd . some gape , unsure of how to react as they watch the face of death  the unaffected the foreigners the strangers those who have nt so much as glimpsed the dragging coattail of death  . others jeer , telling him to do it  the wretched ones who ve never heard the phrase solipsism  yet follow such an idea into deprivation of selfawareness  . the remaining make some sort of plea , asking him to think of his loved ones , his future , who he impacts  the few with bravery and compassion the fifty people abraham could not find  . newline newline it s funny in a way that ca nt be put into words . in it s anonymous moment , the vox populi becomes true humanity . the doorway has been thrown open , and the crowds are peering inside . in there , they see infinity . his infinity  and theirs as well , though they do nt know that yet  . with no repercussions , they open their boxed selftruth and show their true colors . newline newline as he must show his . parting cracked lips , he murmurs the five words he came here to say . newline newline the bridge is in a bustling city  a veritable metropolis  , with a sundry of ethnicities all who speak their own language . and they all hear his words in their native tongue . only the closest heard it at first , his soft words unable to beat the verbal tide of the crowd . they are compelled to turn and inform the others . so it spreads , like a fire . like it fire it spreads until it has nowhere left to spread and it dies out . once everyone had heard , silence reigns king . newline newline the first person , a woman clothed in a softshell jacket and dark blue jeans  one who was imploring him to think of his parents  , is the first to go . she marches forth . even as she steps off , she continues to walk in the air . walking until she hits the bottom . it s a long way down . still , she s not walking for very long . newline newline the crowd  his flock  follows . one by one . people who had been telling him to jump mere moment before find themselves doing exactly that . the strangers who were

. newline newline why ? newline newline the reason escaped him . the random did as it wished . an idiot god , yes . but a god nonetheless . newline newline his lips twitch upward , and reveal a set of

scheduled me another appointment directly afterwards . the people in the predicted scheduling department always knew when another appointment would become available , but they did nt look deep enough to find out that this person would have no cure . the people in that department were all mules , a side effect of their power . they were very stubborn and said that if an appointment was changed it would change the balance of everything . my name is dr. fergus coleman , and my power is to be able to prescribe medicine perfectly for every ailment . my last patient developed a power to have blood that turns into mercury , which is nt too hard to prescribe for . she has to take 4 100 mg neobenzalcitracite cadmilocidum tablets everyday , with the recommended brand being cadmilo . anyways , the patient that came after her was an enigma . he was just 15 years old , and his name was bradley elliott . he had a very rare power : he had a large tumor that , once it was excised , would regrow in another place on his body . he was another one of the unfortunate ones . his parents , very nervous , were both with him . they explained to me that he had seen surgeons with the ability to cut with atomic precision , and that it had nt helped . so , they came to see me , one of the best prescribers in the world . i looked at bradley . his skin sagged in a few places where tumors were removed , and he had a large bulb on his hand . the tumors were nt malignant , but they were bad for his body . my mind , for the first time ever , drew a blank . there was no way with medicine to treat this kid . some of the unlucky ones can get depower  a brand that created medicine to suppress powers , with the medical name being disindynamosidenflalinol  , but that would nt work here . he d have to live his life with this awful  power  , if one could call it that . i asked him to describe what else he can do . he said ,  well , at the moment , i can grow tumors at will , in any place i want .  no luck . i responded ,  well bradley , it seems that at the moment , there is nt anything i can do . you ll have to come back for another appointment .  as soon as i said that , his face fell . his parents started sobbing , and they had to be led out of the lawrence j. abraham memorial hospital . newline newline  dr. coleman , id 4562 , you are needed in room 386 .  newline the elliott family was back . i had thought of something their son could do . he could work with a transmuter and a surgeon , growing tumors , having them expertly cut , and having the result transformed into food for third world countries . his face brightened up when i told him the news . the only way to transmute meat is to use living cells . this could be a lucrative business , and i gave him the names of some colleagues that would love to do this with him . his life was set up now , and a psychoanalyzer was nt even needed to find what would be done . finally , a working cure for a puzzling patient . so ...

 yes pumpkin .  newline newline she called me pumpkin . i know i never told him this . my grandmother had passed away about ten years earlier . she was the first person i was really close to that passed away . i had a horrible time with it . i did nt get to the hospital in time to say goodbye . everyone else got to tell her goodbye but me . they said they did nt know she was going to pass so fast and were trying to spare me until they knew for sure . i was the youngest . but i had every much a right to be there as anyone else . i was angry over it for years . i still got mad when i

newline  what namma  newline newline  i was with you the day i left . i saw you . and its ok.  said my grandma newline newline  sorry namma , i wanted to be there .  newline newline  i know pumpkin . you were not there but i was with you .  newline newline at this point i just started crying . i felt such a relief wash over me . the ouija starts moving again . newline newline  love you pumpkin . be happy . bye .  newline newline  i love you too namma .  newline newline i would have never ever believed this could have happened . we were only messing around with the ouija because we were bored and honestly a little drunk . oh gosh , i hope grandma did nt know i had been drinking . but i guess the good thing is no matter why it happened ... maybe it was just my subconscious that took over so i could let it go . all i know is whatever happened that day , helped me let go of all that anger and finally come to peace with myself . newline newline newline newline newlinei was a master summoner . i not only summoned demons , i pulled from realms that you ca nt even imagine . i simply had a thought one day . i ve summoned daemons  from the old greek  , i ve talked to the dead , you name it , i ve summoned it . anything from the frost giants of jotunhiem to the the least significant spirits of eastern religions . i ve even visited asgard on a few occasions . newline newline i , however , have never summoned an angel . i eventually became hellbent on summoning one . the issue arose when i learned that no one in history has called an angel . this was troubling . this meant i had to figure it out myself . newline newline the first thing i went and got was a dove . seemed fitting at the time . then i got the chalk . i called forth the decahedron cage for the dove and put it inside after drawing a wing in the summoners circle . i lit the candles and began to chant in hebrew . newline newline at this point you may be thinking that latin should have been used . i choose to use hebrew instead of latin due to the fact that the jewish people were the first to record their interactions with the angels of god . newline newline fundamentally , it was the same chant that was used to summon a daemon , but backwards . technically speaking it was forwards . you would also replace daemon with angel in the chant . newline newline when finished , i was met with a beauty unlike any i had ever seen . newline newline  hello summoner ,  she said sweetly with a british accent ,  what can we assist you with  newline newline  i have questions .  i stated simply in english . newline newline  ask away then  she said . newline newline  why am i the first to summon you before  newline newline  your the first to use hebrew to try and summon us .  newline newline  why do you not intervene anymore ?  newline newline  we found reddit . we became addicted and stopped listening . funnily enough , reddit was created by mortals like yourself.  newline newline  let me get this straight , you stopped interacting with the earth because of reddit ? then how d you answer  newline newline  i m sorry , but your time is up , this automated angel broadcast was beamed into your head by the aatn or the automated angel transmission network . thank you for your questions . now we really must be getting back to reddit .  newline newline and that is how i learned that angels are reddit addicts , just like you and me , and this is why they ve never answer their summons . newline newlinei do nt exactly have much left . but what i have i will gladly give for her . newline newline i hold the letter , the only letter i will ever need , in my hand as i walk towards the pawn shop . newline newline this is one of the seedier parts of town , nowhere else would do what i

this she ll be dead within the month . if i do , she could have a full life , a happy life . the doctor promised me she would get the minimum of 25 more years . and to keep her alive i will do just

she wore . newline newline  i ve never been able to do that . why would you change that ?  my mind raced , wondering if i would finally be able to see one of my best friends , properly . newline newline  because it s important to you ,  the sounds of alien blasters cut through the silence , almost tearing away my attention .  you have to be quick . yes or no ?  newline newline  fine ,  i hurriedly responded .  let me see you ,  my vision seemed to pop , and suddenly , i found myself in full control of where i was looking . i looked up , staring at what may as well have been a gender bent version of myself . newline newline  oh ,  she said , beginning to walk away .  happy birthday , by the way ,  my mouth fell open , my motor skills abandoning me . newline newline  what ? but , how is it you ?  she turned around , walking backwards . newline newline  why do you say that like we re any different ?  the wolf s grin on her face grew broader as she flickered , replaced by a perfect image of myself momentarily .  you said it yourself . i m just a part of you . you narcissistic   a wave of energy rippled outwards from me , the world falling away until it was just the two

think so . that s not how you treat me at all . how about you cool off , and i ll talk to you tomorrow , huh ?  i frowned , my grip on consciousness slipping suddenly . the last thing i saw was a blurry image that could have been me , laughing amongst the darkness . newline newline i contemplated how much i must hate myself to want to be alone forever , but i very quickly realised i did nt hate myself . i was fairly happy with my life so far and had no major regrets . i found myself content with the fact that i d feel that way about me for the rest of my life . and with that thought , i let myself slip back into deep sleep , resolving to remain unconscious until the morning . tonight had already had enough adventure .the writer picked up his old moleskine journal , it  s binding coming undone and the back cover hanging off . he had recently been going through his old stuff from his high school days , looking for things to throw away to make room for new things . he took a deep breath , preparing himself for the worst , sat down at his desk , and opened the journal . newline newline sloppy , smeared handwriting greeted him inside . line after line of his nearly indecipherable scrawling text . dialogue , setting , paragraphs . he looked over it with pangs of nostalgia , and just a touch of embarrassment . this was some of his early work . and it was absolutely horrible . but it was his , so he kept it . all these years , in the back of his closet , waiting for him . he flipped through the pages , remembering what it was like to write all this out , sitting on his bed in his old family home . he was so young back then . so nave . newline newline he read through everything he had written , slogged through the awkward love scenes between the main character he based on himself and the female character he based on his then girlfriend . their messy breakup was one of the main reasons he stopped writing this story . he learned a lesson then . never base characters completely off of people you know . newline newline he got to the end , and being a sentimental sap , wrote a note on the page where he left off . newline newline i  m sorry to do this to you . i really am . you know how much effort i put into this . you were there , every step of the way . i thought about your story every day , and i was really excited about it . but i had no idea what i was doing back then . i just rushed into this , having no plans about where the plot was going , not even knowing what the plot was in the first place . it was a rookie effort at best . but i  ve gotten better . i  ve started a new project , one that actually has a plot . it  s going to be a long haul , but i think it  ll make it big . so thank you , for being my first big failure . because without you , i never would have gotten to where i am now . newline newline m newline newline he put down his pen and smiled . he was closing the book , when something caught his eye on the last page . he opened it back up to reveal that a message was appearing below the one he had just written . newline newline a rookie effort ? your first big failure ? that  s all we are to you ? is that really what you think ? you created us , and now you toss us aside like garbage . you never cared about us . and now you  re going to throw us away . newline d newline newline startled , the writer sat there for a while , looking at the note that had been written . the handwriting wasn  t his , not even close , so it couldn  t have been something that he had written and somehow hadn  t seen . besides that , he told himself , this is clearly referencing what i just wrote . newline newline he decided to write back , see if there was another response . maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him . he picked his pen back up and began to write again . newline newline i said i was sorry . i am sorry . but i couldn  t continue with this story after the breakup , you know that . there was too much in here based on emily , and after we split , i couldn  t bring myself to continue writing about her . newline m newline newline well maybe you should ve thought of that before you started writing about us . you took a huge risk , and it did nt pay off , and you just blew us off when it became  too hard  for you . you re selfish . you re weak . you re a terrible writer . newline d newline newline the writer sighed and rubbed his eyes , growing tired of this back and forth with someone who s stuck in the mindset of a high school freshman . newline newline alright , look . i understand where you re coming from and what you re thinking . i created you . and i know you feel abandoned , because you think you re all alone . you think nbody really understands you . you think you re the only one who really  gets it  . but heads up  you re not . there are people out there who could understand you , who could help you , but you do nt reach out to them because you hold your standards too high . and now you re alone . not because of me , but because of you . you made yourself alone . and now your time is up . goodbye . newline m newline newline the writer signed his initial , closed the journal , and leaned back from his desk . he sat there for a while , staring at the journal . after a while , he stood up , took the journal off of his desk , and walked into his kitchen . he rummaged around in his kitchen drawers until he found what he was looking for  a book of matches . he took the matches and the journal and walked to his back door . newline newline he stepped outside , into the warm summer evening air . the sun was setting , and the wind was still . perfect night for a little fire , the writer thought to himself . he placed the journal on the ground , and opened it up to a blank page . he struck a match , and dropped it onto the open pages of the journal . it did nt take long for it to ignite , and soon it was burning nicely , the fire crackling and smoking . the writer smiled to himself , and looked into the sunset . he stood there like that until the sun went all the way down below the mountains , and then looked down at what remained of the journal . there was a scorched area of his stone patio , but he did nt mind too much . the journal was a pile of ashes now , smoldering weakly . he stamped them out with his foot , leaving nothing burning newline newline the writer thought to himself that it was oddly poetic , what he had done . he  d destroyed his work , but at the same time , had destroyed an old part of himself , a part that he wasn  t necessarily proud of anymore . he felt rejuvenated , revitalized , like a phoenix who had just been born again from ash . a fitting metaphor , he thought with a smile , as he walked back inside his house . he shut the door , and turned out the patio lights . the pile of ash sat there , until the wind began to pick up . slowly , the pile began to get smaller , as the ash was carried away into the air . eventually , as the writer lay asleep in his bed , the last of the ashes disappeared , blown off in the breeze . and in that moment , the writer and daniel , his creation , both knew peace .the doctor strolled into the room gaily , a spring in his step that was just too even and a smile that creased over his cheeks like a freshly ironed pair of slacks . he took one look at the patient and then , seemingly overwhelmed by the image of a dying man , turned around and grabbed a chart that sat in a small shelf on the wall furthest from the diseased . after briefly reviewing the patient  s medical record , the doctor set down the chart and hopped over to the bedside . newline newline  hey there , nathan ! how are things today ?  newline newline nathan wanted to scream , but he couldn  t . he didn  t have the energy for it anymore . he took a couple deep breaths before responding . newline newline  about the same , doc . about the same ,  came the raspy , hardly audible reply . the  lack of  sound , the  lack of  intensity in his voice always gave rise to a great sinking sensation for nathan . i was a professional auctioneer , he wanted to add , to let dr. madison know that he was so much more than this crippled husk . i yelled for a living . newline newline  well that  s good !  dr. madison seemed to perk up at the thought of everything being exactly as despicable as they had been a few days ago and took the opportunity to flash nathan a bonus peek of his outstanding set of pearly whites . nathan returned only a cold glare , the coldest his diminished facial muscles were capable of producing . he knew that it was probably not very intimidating , but even still he felt a weak satisfaction in ignoring traditional deadman etiquette . he could see that the doctor wanted him gone , out of his life to make room for the patient that might actually have a chance . he could see it in his hooded glance and practiced smile . newline newline newline dr. madison was exhausted . his lab coat was pristine , but his drive withered after another 18hour shift . he had always known that oncology would be a difficult profession , but he could not have accounted for the allencompassing , constitutive nature of the field . he could not have known that every dead patient would weigh so heavily upon his conscience , every saved patient so little . he could not have guessed that the stress accumulated over the course of the day would drag behind him like a cartoon ball and chain , that he would be unable to checkin the burden at airports like he checked in his socks or a tshirt during the few times of the year when he could spend extended periods of time with his loved ones . newline newline  your scans show that your tumors have been growing at a decreased rate over the past couple of months , which i assure you is nothing to sniff at ,  he continued .  however , given the adverse effects of the combined chemotherapy and radiation treatment , i think it  s time we start thinking about a different goal with your care.  he saw nathan just barely roll his eyes , an expression that must have taken some dedication given the tumor  s established impingement of his third cranial nerve . dr. madison knew all too well the anxiety and frustration the patient must feel spending his last days attached to 4 ivs and a nurse that knew his routine too well , but there was little that could be done . the patient knew that , too . newline newline after a few seemingly effortful breaths , nathan managed to respond .  goal ?  newline newline  i think it  s time ,  dr. madison stated quietly ,  to consider palliative care.  he paused for effect , to allow the words to sink in .  that means , as i  m sure you know , that we terminate your current medication and treatment in favor of providing of you with the best reduction of symptoms to make this time more bearable for you and your family.  newline newline nathan took a long time to respond this time , and not because it would be difficult to make out the words . eventually , after what seemed like an hour  s worth of pin drop silence , he said ,  so that  s it ? i  m done ?  newline newline  well it  s just that given the severity of your condition , you might find that you would prefer to spend this time fully cognizant and able to realize whatever you might need to do before  dr. madison  s voice trailed off for a moment .  before you no longer can.  newline newline this time , nathan  s response was quick .  so that  s it ? i  m done ?  newline newline dr. madison took nathan  s hand in his own . it was cold and brittle and it reminded him of an ice sculpture he saw at a wedding some years ago . it hit him after a moment  his own wedding , ten years prior . he smiled kindly at nathan once more .  i  m sorry , but i don  t know how much longer we  ll be able to fend off this cancer . you may only have a few weeks.  a knock came at the door , and a nurse dressed in sky blue sporting cherry red lipstick peered into the room . newline newline  dr . madison ,  she started shyly ,  your patient in room 8 has been waiting for a long time and is feeling restless.  dr. madison waived her away and , after letting the deafening echo of the shut door dissipate , looked down again at nathan .  i  m sorry ,  he repeated . nathan smiled softly and beckoned wordlessly for dr. madison to go see his other patient . dr. madison sighed internally because he knew that that the smile was nothing more than a flexion of the zygomaticus muscle , that beneath the surface nathan could not stand him because he was the one forced to stare blankly at a clock that ticked away his final moments . he could see it in the hooded glance , the practiced smile . you stole my cookie !  zack screamed at the top of his lungs to his friend .  i m sorry .  his friend alex started to cry . she placed his head into hands , tears dripping down her palms . newline  do nt you fucking cry ! why did you do it ? !  he grabs alex s hands and placed them on the table .  now , i m going to count to three .  zack reached into his jeans pocket and pulled out a small switchblade .  1 .  he started as alex tried to escape , to no avail .  2 .  he smirked .  and 3 . okay .  zack slammed the knife in between alex s fingers , missing them slightly .  i m sorry ... just do nt take my cookie . i do nt typically reassert the prompt but i think you are asking to split a hair  technology like the windmill is still technology even though it does nt have a

the street . shambling slowly . until they saw us . then they started to run . hellfire , they were running . newline newline i scooped up lucy .  cmon ralph !  newline newline i d never run from a zombie before . never had to . ralph was out of breath after half a block and the blue ones were catching up . he might have a heart attack before he got to his apartment . i took quick stock , lucy had fired three shots . we had eight left . i could hear those undead feet slapping the pavement behind us . i was slowing down to keep from leaving ralph behind , but this plan was not working . newline newline  keep going !  i panted at him , and stopped and turned . i nearly crapped myself , they were closer than they sounded . barely aiming , i put a round through the first one , right above the sternum . his shoulder split away in that plastic yellow gore that rehardened as it hit the air . round two went to the second one and gave us all a few more yards as the zombies stumbled about , their injuries slowly congealing and turning blue again . precious seconds . newline newline it took two more rounds to take the leg off of the first one . not a fast zombie now . precious rounds . newline newline i realigned my sites on the second one , as it recovered its balance and began picking up speed again . save the five rounds or knock off our pursuit ? it was eight more blocks to home . newline newline ralph screamed from the corner ahead of me . a zombie from a side street had its hands on him . it was a 30 yard shot . no hesitation other than the fleeting thought that the spray would go away from him and not touch him . the zombie hit the ground , its head like a peacock with all the feathers spread . it groaned and writhed slowly . newline newline ralph was shaking as i caught up to him . newline newline  come on man , we really need to move !  newline newline he nodded breathlessly . newline newline after the apocalypse had settled in , the city became so quiet . there was the wind , the rustling leaves , and occasionally the sound of slow shambling . now we heard the sound of an unseen but not far off mob . the hair on the back of my neck prickled . newline newline lucy held on tight to me and was quite but alert . daddy s trooper . we had to get to jess and i hoped to god she had nt decided to go out on her own . she nearly always took the long gun and surely we would have heard at least one shot if she were in trouble . and of course , we needed to tell june , our neighbor and ralph s wife . newline newline we were at a jog and ralph was wheezing hard , brow sweating profusely . the zombie reconstituting behind us was just about matching our pace . three blocks from home . just three precious blocks . that s where we saw the mob . newline newline through the alley on the next street over , a couple broke away sprinting towards us . newline newline  go ralph !  newline newline he nodded , true fear behind the exhaustion , and not breaking his now stumbling stride . newline i stood at the intersection with my five rounds . i looked from the two coming towards me fast to ralph struggling to make some distance . if he yelled right now , june might hear . lucy was no weight in my arms and i saw her looking gritty daggers at the two runners . she was going to take some revenge on them for being fast , i could see . a life s mission born in that moment . newline newline i took one last look at ralph , gauging his distance , trying to buy him time . the runners were almost to me and i raised the gun and aimed carefully . a good shot would keep them down for a minute . four rounds , three rounds . more were coming behind them and yet more had heard the shots . i ran after ralph , and as we passed the next alley , more met us there . they tackled ralph and three bodies tumbled to the street . i kicked one off the top of him and shoved the other with my foot just enough to get a clean shot into it . the other had him by the leg again and as it twisted i heard a sickening tear of cartiledge . ralph yelled in agony . the second to last bullet rolled its blue body twice over . newline newline ralph looked up at me in pain , tears in his eyes mixing with the sweat . i had to blink my own eyes a couple times hard . we had seconds , but the decision was already made . newline newline  take care of june for me . tell her i love her . go take care of jess .  newline newline there was one bullet left in the gun . not enough for the mob running at us . but enough for ralph . newline i handed him the gun . lucy in my arms , i ran the last twoandahalf blocks . newline newline i heard the shot ring out at one block . newline newlinei did nt think anything could hit me harder than that telephone pole at speeds well over onehundred miles per hour , but that was only moments before i was hit and blinded by the light . not just blinded , but revved up like a deuce , just another runner in the night . newline newline  so , how was it ?  the light asked . newline newline shielding my eyes i attempted to stare in the direction of the voice . newline newline  how was , what ?  i asked . newline newline  heaven .  newline newline i paused for a second and attempted to gather my thoughts . newline newline  well , are you kicking me out already ? i just got here .  newline newline there was a deep laugh  almost jolly of sorts , if you had to apply an adjective to it  not much unlike the santa claus laugh portrayed in movies , but less ... optimistic . newline newline  no , no , i m not kicking you out . in fact , i may send you back in .  newline newline  i m sorry , but i do nt understand ,  i said .  back in where ?  newline newline  heaven .  newline newline and then , it clicked . newline newline  wait . are you telling me heaven is a place on earth ?  newline newline the light nodded . i do nt know how i made this determination , but it did . newline newline  it s a place where love comes first . it s a world where you re just beginning to understand the miracle of living . and if you were afraid , be afraid no more ,  god said . newline newline  that s ... deep .  newline newline  no , it s belinda carlisle . i sent her as a messenger years ago , but no one truly listened .  newline newline  it was probably because of the hair ...  newline newline  it was definitely because of the hair ...  god agreed . newline newline  so ,  i stammered ,  now what ?  newline newline the light sighed and weighed its options . after a moment , it continued . newline newline  ok , how about a do over ? i m sending you back to heaven for a chance to do it the right way this time .  newline newline i was speechless . at a loss for words . newline newline  than ...  newline newline  and i need you to take a defensive driving course . buy a bigger vehicle . wear your seatbelt .  newline newline  yes sir ...  newline newline  and sorry about your face . you re probably going to have a few scars after this one .  newline newline  all good , god . all . good . what seemed to be a couple entered the pharmacy , the women in front , going straight to the shampoo aisle , the man in the back following mindlessly . as she is deciding which one to choose between volume and silkiness the bored man looks at the ceiling and sigh . after what seemed for him like hours and to her seconds , she goes , bottle in hand , directly towards the cash register . the women looking through her purse ask the cashier : you take 100  bills ? , great !  she reached for him from behind and pushed him towards the counter . newline the 16 years old cashier was on her first week and did nt have any training about counterfeit bills . still she took him arm and carefully watched the light of the neon lighting bounce off his sweaty face , made him bend over the counter and under the uv light which was not on . the young apprentice not wanting to look like one decided not to look for the switch and decided to smile to the client , put bill behind her , open the cash register and give back four twenty dollars and some change .they stood , three strangers atop a windy mountain at the edge of existence . their journey had both been brief and yet had lasted lifetimes . beneath their naked feet , the mountain peak was swathed in a thick blanket of hazy smog . as they gazed up , the trio could see nothing but an unending chasm that left a cloying cold emptiness at the pit of their stomach . the silence was broken by an exclamation from the tallest of the three , a curly haired youth that had believed in yahweh . newline newline  your penises ... they re ... covered  he said as he reached towards the genitals of the arabian man . newline newline  step back from me blasted infidel ! allah be praised why are my virgins males !  he exclaimed as he slapped away the inquisitive hand that prowled ever closer to his foreskin . newline newline  in nomine patris , et filii , et spiritus sancti  exclaimed the elderly man as he hastily traced an upright cross across his chest using a trembly liverspotted hand . newline newline from above the trio there erupted a thunderous giggle , a sound that seemed to drive nails into the feet of the three men . as they stood shaking , the fog seemed to peel back like a curtain upon a stage , revealing an empty mass that swirled and coalesced before them . newline newline  you three have been deemed the most pious of your religions , so much that you have earnt your rite of passage into our society . serve us as loyally as you have served your gods and we will ensure that you do not face an eternity in purgatory .   the voice seemed to fill their minds , to fill their heads and to fill their very souls . they shook in euphoric ecstasy at the sensation of being touched by those that upheld the very fabric of reality . this moment burned like a beacon upon a dark sea within their mind , for in this moment they had become part of the very boundaries of the universe . then , like the snap of a finger , they had felt the soft grass beneath their feet . they had returned to the meat sacks that they inhabited . newline newline  my creator , what is it you require of us  wheezed out the old man as he fell to his knees , hands clasped in prayer before him . the other two soon followed , with the arabian male performing the sujud and the curly haired youth prostating himself upon the mountain peak . newline newline  return to your mudplanet , speak praise and convert all to your false gods . feed us the souls of the damned , the voice returned in a hiss of venom and purpose . it drove shards of ice through their respective consciousness and froze them to the core as the revelation shook them . yet they knew that this would be preferable to the emptiness that they had faced , the eternity that lay within . their bodies began to fade like fog in the sun , their memories still retained as they were reborn . newline newline so arose the saints of christendom , the prophets and messengers of islam and the tzadikim of judaism . so it was that they were fed the souls of the departed . it s all a bunch of superstitious hooey ,  scoffed gerald as he straightened his fedora on his fat , balding head . it was beginning to slide just a little too far over his forehead because of all his slippery sweat . newline newline  but it ca nt be , uncle jerry !  reasoned mabel , a short 7year old girl .  you would nt want to make god angry by saying things like that !  newline newline gerald was convinced that everything mabel was saying was a result of it being beaten into her by his insane older sister over the course of her entire lifetime . clarice has become a bornagain christian not too long after having had her first car crash at the age of 20 . newline newline  gerald , stop saying things like that in front of mabel ,  groaned clarice .  she gets night terrors .  newline newline  maybe that s because you ve been fucking her over , telling her all this bullshit her whole life ! she s traumatized !  yelled gerald . newline newline  gerald , do nt tell me how to raise my kid . especially when you re just a knownothing teen who s on the computer all day . what would you know ?  said clarice , now fixing mabel s hair . newline newline  god s gon na send uncle jerry to the bad place , right mama ? just like you said ?  asked mabel , looking up into her mother s eyes . clarice looked a bit flustered after mabel had said that . newline newline  well , clarice , am i ? !  challenged gerald , teeth grit in his mouth . clarice just stood staring at the ground , tv still blaring on in the background . a blonde reporter was introducing the next interviewee at st. charles hospital , who had also experienced seeing her clinically dead child wake in up a panic , describing a place that was  empty and quiet .  newline newline clarice looked away , which caused gerald to grunt loudly and exit the room , slamming the door behind him . clarice sighed and went on fixing lunch for mabel . she had school in an hour . newline newline   newline newline gerald was sitting on the sofa with a copy of richard dawkin s the god delusion when mabel walked into the room . she sat on the couch next to gerald and begin putting on her shoes . newline newline  mabel ?  asked gerald , looking up from his book . newline newline  yes , uncle jerry ?  replied mabel as she laced up her pink lightup shoes . newline newline  you do nt really think i m going to the bad place , right ?  newline newline  no .  said mabel . newline newline  then why would you say that ?  asked gerald , closing his book and resting it on the table in front of him . newline newline  because that s what mom says .  newline newline  mabel , someday , you ll have to decide for yourself if what your mom says is true or not . and even though she might be right about some things , it is nt necessarily the best or nicest thing to say to people . you have to always say and do nice things , alright ?  newline newline  yes , uncle jerry .  newline newline  good , now go and get your lunch so that we can go to school .  newline newline mabel jumped up and ran to the kitchen , where her mother was still watching the news . gerald could hear the story continuing in the background . newline newline   newline newline on the sidewalk , gerald and mabel were nearing the school when a boy on the other side ran outside of his house , playing with a basketball . mabel wove hi to the boy , recognizing him from her class . newline newline the street was pretty busy that morning , and since gerald and mabel were relatively late , disgruntled parents were yelling profanities and making irrational driving decisions in an effort to get their kid to school on time . newline newline when gerald and mabel finally reached the school , gerald got down on a knee and gave her a big hug .  remember , always do and say nice things , okay ?  , gerald reminded her . newline newline as he said that , the boy in mabel s class on the other side of the street had just lost control of his ball , and off it went bouncing off into the street . newline newline  i got it !  , yelled mabel , as she ran into the street after the ball before gerald could grab her . newline newline  mabel , stop !  screamed gerald , running out into the street after her . gerald then heard a loud beep sound , then a thump just as he had finally caught up to mabel and grabbed her wrist . newline newline   newline newline gerald awoke in a breezy field of flowers in every color . the sky was a blazing blue , and the flowers stretched on for miles . newline newline  is this ... am i ?  he tried to speak , but for some reason , he choked on his words . it was almost like a dream . gerald looked around for a few seconds until he caught sight of a whiteclothed figure nearby . gerald walked towards him , and as he walked , the flowers around him danced and giggled with a pleasant cadence . newline newline  hey there , uncle jerry ,  said the figure . newline newline  are you god ?  asked gerald . newline newline  i guess you could say that .  newline newline  so if you re god , then this must be ... so the stories were true ?  newline newline  what stories ?  newline newline  well , you re god , are nt you supposed to know ?  newline newline god laughed .  gerald , gerald , gerald . always skeptical . just the way i wanted .  newline newline  why would you want me that way ?  newline newline  alright , look . i ll level with you . just you can stop giving me shit , i ll tell you what happened . so a few centuries ago , i kind of ... lost heaven .  newline newline  what the fuck does that even mean ? !  newline newline  lost heaven ... you know , like losing a house ? i could nt keep up with the payments yadda yadda yadda , so i had to move .  newline newline  you ... moved heaven ?  newline newline  basically . which really kind of sucks , you know ? i mean , last heaven was pretty fucking far out , gerald , let me tell you ...  newline newline  what ? tell me what ?  gerald grew restless as he became more aware of the flowers constantly smacking his legs . it was becoming painful .  and why are all these fucking flowers here ?  gerald yelled as he tried to kick them away from him . when the blow landed , one of them shouted  uncle jerry !  newline newline mabel . newline newline  mabel ! mabel , where are you ? !  cried gerald , falling to the ground on his knees and examining all the flowers . newline newline  that s the bad thing about universe real estate , gerald . prices are just really jacked up now . it has nt been the same since ,  mused god , staring at gerald , gerald relentlessly scanning the flowers around him . he finally heard the voice again . it was coming from a flower to the right of his face , a bright pink rose . gerald opened the petals up and found a small , glass ball housed inside the petals . in it was a tiny humanoid figure , walking in no particular direction . newline newline it was mabel . newline newline  what the fuck did you do with her ?  yelled gerald , watching mabel as she yelled out the names of her family members , one by one . he opened another flower , and there sat another small humanoid figure , sitting on their bum , and giggling eerily to themselves . newline newline  ever heard of purgatory ? that s kind of what it is . after a while , though , you humans are all the same , and you just sort of mentally check out .  newline newline gerald s face went white as every flower around him revealed a small human being , trapped in an abyss of nothingness , slowly going mad as time progressed . newline newline  anyways , like i said , you can only get so much real estate nowadays . luckily , flowers are pretty and do nt take up so much space . it was part of a deal with lucifer , and we had to compromise , since i had no one else to cosign with me . i was pretty much at the end of my rope .  newline newline it all became clear to gerald . the news stories that he had heard , the children waking up screaming . the emptiness of heaven . gerald got up and tried to attack god , but with a wave of the hand , gerald froze in place . newline newline  i think i made you guys a bit too entitled . i mean , i gave you guys everything , and still you demand more . which is why i m going to give it to you , gerald . i m gon na give you what you know you deserve . lucky for you , satan s still pretty well off right now .  newline newline gerald felt his body slowly sink into the ground , and as it happened , he stared at mabel s rose . curiously , he had stopped hearing mabel s shouting . newline newline  guess clarice was right all along , uncle jerry . soulmates die together . newline newline that was a fundamental truth of our existence . no one knew how , and no one knew why . but it was true . we accepted it . newline newline so from puberty onward , that became the goal . find your soulmate . sure , you can waste time and fool around , but that s what everyone was looking for . the perfect lasting love : the love so strong that you could not go on living without it . newline newline perhaps the most amazing part was that we got very good at it . most people found their soulmates . it became the norm to have joint funerals for a departed couple . and i had been convinced i had found mine . newline newline we were married seven years , and we were happy . or at least i was . so i ignored the signs . the late nights at the office . the excuses . the sudden changes in clothing style . we were soulmates , so what did i have to worry about ? newline newline then i found them . in our bed . i saw them , but they did nt see me . newline newline i do nt remember getting the gun . but i do remember firing it . six times . newline newline i guess it is true . newline newline soulmates die together . newline newline  newline newline if you enjoyed this , you can find more of my prompt responses at  pubby s creative workshop   https :

to his decades spent in the underearth . he began to speak into the headset  but stopped , a habit hard to break .  who else is going to do it ?  he thought .  who else but me has toiled high and low in sweet and in sorrow with neither the wind nor the touch of life or the sun , or the foundation upon which life has sprung itself to soothe my self !  newline newline his long years spent underground had made him bitter yet peaceful . his long years searching had made him mentally fatigued and withdrawn . he knew it was too late to care , that there was no point and this addition will be as tedious as the last and the next and the one after that . he knew that the underearth will become as vile and corrupt , and as stagnant of soul and replete of malice as the overearth had some time millions of years ago . newline newline the underearth was necessary . the planet had been starved and the last great war had set up vast networks of hyperiongrade phaser cannons just outside the earth s atmosphere that could be set off like dominoes in a mutually assured destruction of what little of the planet remained . so we sat underneath the charred and dusty surface of a once vibrant planet . tucked away in titanium walled rooms like ants betwixt dizzying series of tunnels and highways and transportubes . governments now able to block off and defend their territory from all angles , the repercussions were dire for any citizen that did nt manage to dig their way to and unexplored area . forced matings , food was basically nonexistent , earthquakes were increasingly dangerous , books as we know them are extinct , replaced by neuronalresonance devices that were amplified by the iron and ore in the earth and worked similar to radio , broadcasting staterun media , the only kind

doing the right thing . sometimes it s hard to argue . newline newline these guys come from all across the multiverse . some are from little old earth while others are from fantasylike universes . my

going to save the world then he has to fight through the horrors he causes . newline newline  it started when i was a teenager i guess .  says the supreme ruler .  i realized that what my father had done was terrible . worse yet i realized that there was no way to stop him . we could nt have a revolution . the nobles were happy with the way things were , and the underclass had been beaten down for so long that they d lost the will to fight .  newline newline  from my position i ca nt do anything . if i try to make any changes i ll be replaced ... so ... i had an idea .  the supreme ruler sighed deeply and ran his hand through his hair .  the people needed a hero . the problem being of course that there were nt any . well as any storybook tells you the best way to make a hero is to give him a tragic background .  the supreme leader averted his eyes and cleared his throat . newline newline  so i implemented a new rule . every year i d visit the homes of the best and brightest kids , and i d personally execute their parents in front of them for treason .  the supreme leader s blank stare tunneled through the ceiling .  this year i hear that one of these kids has started making trouble . he s gathered a little group and he s been taking down government buildings one by one .  a weak smile creeped onto the supreme leader s face . newline newline  word is he s headed for the capitol . nothing we can do apparently . they say he s gunning for my head . he s been promising a complete revolution . freedom for all and such .  a mirthless chuckle escaped from the supreme leader s lips .  well hopefully this ll be the last you hear from me . if you ever get a guy by the name of shay smith in here , well ... i guess i just have to hope my little hero does nt let

aspects of bird law . dennis and dee burst in , having a loud , animated conversation about an incredibly valuable diamond necklace that their mother apparently bequeathed to them by accident . they offer to cut mac and charlie in on the sale of it , but ask them not to tell frank . newline newline frank enters the bar , and the rest of the gang goes silent , immediately arousing his suspicion . they try to dodge his questions about what they were talking about , but charlie is a terrible liar and lets a few clues slip about it being a valuable secret . frank drops the matter , but he clearly is intent on getting to the bottom of it . newline newline later on that evening , mac is at home , watching predator and practicing with his nun chucks . he accidentally smashes a bunch of beer bottles on his counter , and as he is picking up the shards , frank enters through the window wearing a nylon over his head . he sneaks up behind mac and shoves a rag soaked with chloroform into his face . newline newline mac comes to in an abandoned warehouse , strapped down to a table . frank appears above him with a garden spout . he demands that mac tell him what the the secret that dennis and dee are trying to hide from him is . mac tries to play dumb , and frank proceeds to waterboard him . mac continues to resist , and so frank decides to step it up a notch . he tells mac that a good interrogation is  like a slow and delicate dance , with a chainsaw ,  and he reaches under the table and pulls out a chainsaw . he fires it up , and begins to lower it down towards mac s crotch . mac finally cracks , and spills everything he knows about the necklace . frank demands to know where it is hidden , and mac tells him he does nt know . frank pauses for a moment , then says  i believe you ,  and cuts mac in half , with blood splattering everywhere . newline newline as he finishes and kills the motor , he hears a voice behind him say  holy shit dude .  he spins and sees charlie standing there . charlie begins to freak out , and frank tells him that if he keeps his mouth shut , he will let charlie in on the money from the necklace . he tells charlie that he has always been his favourite , and that he does nt want to hurt him . charlie is not persuaded , and says he is going to go to the cops . franks fires up the chainsaw and runs at charlie . charlie turns and flees , but as he nears the door of the warehouse , his foot is caught in a snare , set earlier by frank , and he is hoisted upside down into the air . frank appears behind him , laughing , and knocks him out with a shovel . newline charlie wakes up some time later , still hanging upside down . he manages to swing himself towards a window , smash it , and use a shard of glass to cut himself free . he lands on his head with thud , and as he picks himself up he notices a piece of paper folded on the floor . it is a note from frank , written in the inscrutable symbols that the illiterate charlie uses in place of words . charlie reads the note , and immediately begins to run . newline newline charlie arrives at the bar , only to find it locked . he runs around to the back , smashes a window , and enters through the kitchen . he enters the bar to find frank brandishing his gun over dennis and dee , who are tied to chairs and sitting in a kiddie pool , with a radio playing the theme song of the show suspended by a rope and pulley over the water . frank is slowly lowering the radio towards the water , threatening to electrocute them if they do nt give him the necklace . charlie shouts at him to stop , and is about to rush at frank when frank reveals the ace up his sleeve . newline newline he steps behind the bar and pulls up the waitress , who he has gagged with her wrists tied together . he threatens to shoot her if charlie tries to interfere , and charlie is paralyzed by the sight of her . frank continues lowering the radio , and it is mere inches over the water when dee finally cracks , and tells frank that the necklace is hidden in the cash register of the bar . laughing triumphantly , frank goes to the register and breaks it open , pulling out the necklace . newline newline frank immediately flies into a rage , realizing that the necklace is a cheap fake , one more cruel trick played on the gang from beyond the grave by dennis and dee s mom . he starts waving the gun around , threatening to kill everyone . charlie seizes the moment to lunge at frank , and they begin to fight , with charlie trying to wrestle the gun away from frank . he shouts to the waitress to run , and she does , fleeing out the back way that charlie came in . newline newline as the scuffle continues , frank tries to aim and shoot at charlie , but the bullet ricochets and severs the rope , and the lights flicker on and off as the radio drops into the water and dennis and dee are electrocuted . charlie is momentarily distracted by the death of his friends , and frank manages to turn the gun on him and shoot him in the stomach . newline charlie staggers backwards , coughing up blood . frank rises to his feet , and taunts charlie , telling him that he is smarter than any of them , and that he will always win . charlies pulls his lighter out of his pocket and says  not always , frank .  just then , frank s nose twitches , as he notices the smell of gas , and realizes that charlie opened up all the gas lines in the kitchen as he was coming in . charlie spits out a mouthful of blood , and stands up straight to face frank . he sneers . newline newline  wild card , bitch .  he strikes the flint and throws the lighter at frank , igniting a fireball that engulfs the bar . newline newline out on the street , the windows and front door are blown off by the force of the blast . the waitress , who has managed to get her hands free and is running away , turns to look back at the burning bar , and is shocked to see a blackened , bloody charlie stagger out of the inferno . he collapses about ten steps from the bar , and the waitress runs back to him . she cradles his head in her arms , and he struggles to speak . newline newline  i m sorry .  he is interrupted by a fit of bloody coughs .  i love you . i ve always loved you .  newline newline sobbing , the waitress kisses him tenderly .  i know ,  she says , and after a short pause ,  my name is mary .  newline newline charlie s eyes light up , revelling in the only real affection he has ever received from his unrequited love . newline newline  oh ,  he says ,  nice to meet you .  with a final cough and a shudder , he dies . newline newline mary , formerly known as the waitress , lowers her head and sobs , as the sound of sirens rises from the distance . newline newline roll credits .thirteen is a very unlucky number , their father told them early and often . why had nt they stopped at twelve ? newline newline twelve was a good number , their mother thought . twelve dancing princesses . seven was a good number as well . she had six sisters herself , so seven and seven would have been lovely and symmetrical . newline newline or three , their father would say . three girls . well , that would have suited them . it would have been a nice number , he thinks often . thirteen is just too many . newline newline of course , it could have been far worse . each daughter was more beautiful than the last , with the exception of the very last and youngest , who was plain where her sisters were pretty , and rather threw off the symmetry of the entire thing . privately their father believed he would have been content , even with girls , had they been twelve or fourteen strong , but thirteen was an  an  an aberration . newline newline that s a very strong word to be throwing around before breakfast , his wife had chided him the last time he had expressed this view , and their father had learnt not to say so in front of the girls . newline newline yasmin and nasreen , dorani and layla , bhasi and sophie , ghadira and maryam , fatima and zahara , isra and khadisha , and last and certainly least , akhara . newline newline but the fact remains that they are thirteen daughters and the heirloom

their apartment a silver box , large enough to hold a pair of shoes , and he sets it in the kitchen table before he goes to prayers . this gives the girls an opportunity to crowd and wonder , but their mother steers them clear of interfering with it until their father returns . newline newline when he does , he takes the box and he holds it and he looks at the girls and he says , one of you will receive this but who ? newline newline and yasmin is the oldest and she should get any sort of heirloom , or at least first refusal , so she says so . newline newline their father nods and considers this and concedes that this is fair , yes . newline newline and nasreen is the first and only married daughter , which makes her husband their father s only son , and if he needs a male heir to inherit he has one , so she says so . newline newline their father nods and considers this and concedes that this is fair , yes . newline newline and dorani is the scholar of the family  clever and witty , with poetry and figures dripping from her tongue in equal measure . if any girl will make something of herself , she will , so she says so . newline newline their father nods and considers this and concedes that this is fair , yes . newline newline and layla is the hardest working of them all  she has been working in the bazaar with her grandmother since she was old enough to understand currency and had given every penny she has earned to support and strengthen this family , so she says so . newline newline their father nods and considers this and concedes that this is fair , yes . newline newline and bhasi is the most talented of the family , a prodigy who had worn out all the shoes she has ever worn with the intricate steps of dance and she drinks applause and devours attention , and if anyone deserves a thing of beauty it is she who has brought so much of it to the world , so she says so . newline newline their father nods and considers this and concedes that this is fair , yes . newline newline and sophie is the only one in the family who stills holds the magic with which they wrought the heirloom , the only daughter to have sat by the fire with their grandfather as he ailed and learned his knowledge to pass on , so she says so . newline newline their father nods and considers this and concedes that this is fair , yes . newline newline and so it goes with the others , who each have their reasons to demand the heirloom : ghadira and maryam , fatima and zahara , isra and khadisha , and last and certainly least , akhara . newline newline and when it comes to last and certainly least , akhara , she says , i do not want it . i do not deserve it . newline newline and their father smiles , and he says , then who does ? tell me , akhara , who is plain when others are pretty , who is unsymmetrical and without pair , who is undeserving and undesiring . who deserves it ? newline newline she says , i ca nt tell you if i do nt know what it is . newline newline he calls her to the table and he steps forward and she inclined her head forward to look as he slips the lid from the silver box , just a sliver , enough that she may gaze inside . she nods , and she has to smile , and her sisters look as though they might burn up with jealousy as akhara looks thoughtful . newline newline give it to yasmin , she says , she is the oldest , and her father does as she says , and yasmin smiles as she takes it , her face aglow with a light that fades the longer she gazes upon the silver box . newline newline no , yasmin says , give it to nasreen  she is newly married and needs the support , and she passes it to her sister , and nasreen beams as she takes it with the expression of one who has seen the stars for the first time , fading as she looks at the heirloom . newline newline no , nasreen says , give it to dorani  she is the cleverest of us all , and she passes it to dorani , who says no , give it layla , who is hard working and never complains , who says give it to bhasi , she is talented and artful , who says give to sophie , who holds all the universe within her capable grasp , who says give it to ghadira , who is the kindest person i have ever met , who gives it to maryam , who is as beautiful as the night sky . newline newline and beautiful maryam gives it to loyal fatima and loyal fatima gives to humble zahara , who gives it to athletic isra who gives it to elegant khadisha , who gives it to , last and certainly least , the undeserving , undesiring , plainnotpretty , unsymmetrical akhara . newline newline why , thank you , akhara says . she takes the heirloom , and she leaves . can you do it ? does it work ?  newline newline  damn right it does .  newline newline the young man in the dark suit left the building and stepped onto the neonlit streets of neo vegas . holographic projectors beamed the latest advertisements for twilight : haley s comet . with a disdainful chuckle , he put on his special sunglasses , and clicked a button on the side . a polarizing filter kicked in , and suddenly the man could no longer see the holoadvertisement , allowing him to walk forward in peace . newline newline however , a few paces from the site of his temporary victor , the true foe appeared : a small , wheeled robot , that approached him and said  let me tell you a quick story !  newline newline the robot began to drone on and on about how its life was turned upside down for the better when he started using product x , but of course his story was far from the short tale promised . people started calling them  long stories ,  and they were the worst . holoads ? polarized filters will remove them . annoyed by the sleep advertisements broadcast to your dreams ? a small microtransaction per day allows you to skip their ads . but the long stories ? they d follow you on their small little wheel until their entire story had finished . there was simply no way around them . newline newline that is , until now . newline newline the man removed a small device from his pocket and oriented it towards the long story . of course , he did this from within the cover of his sleeve , as the droid s cameras were in constant operation , scanning for any misbehavior on behalf of the ad recipient . with a small click , the man activated the device , and a short , concentrated beam of microwaves was aimed and focused on the droid . with a sudden chirp its monologue cutoff and the robot fell on its face to the floor . the circuitry began to emit a small amount of smoke , the insides clearly fried from the contraption s beam . newline newline he laughed , excited that his project for the past few weeks had finally worked . newline newline he d made a long story short .          dropcap  newline newline david got off his bike and walked along the side of the road . it was getting late , and he was still about a mile away from the farm , but he was tired . his argument with suzi had taken a lot out of him . newline newline he replayed the events of the day again in his memory . it still hurt , more than it should have . the recent falling of the towers had sparked a very lively discussion in class that day , of which most were on one side , and few were on the other . suzi was one of the rebels , declaring that war was pointless even in the face of such a vast terrorist threat . he sulked to himself , recalling the look in her eyes as she called his dad  a soldier for nothing .  newline newline  yer dad was a soldier fer nothin  ,  she had said .  government was gon na chew im up an  spit im out just to kill good folks in nam .  newline newline it was nt true , of course . how could it be ? tom paulson was an honest , hardworking man from an honest , hardworking family that ran an honest , hardworking farm . newline newline it was nt true . newline newline abruptly , david stopped , and kicked his bike into the grass . he seethed . if one were being honest , it was clear to see that he was truly mad at himself . his dad had told him , right from the start , how few people agreed with the action taken in vietnam . america was divided against its government then , and had been before and would be after . but tom paulson taught his family that patriotism was the right way to live . he d served for his country , and his forefathers before him . he d be dead and rolling in his grave before one of his three sons refused to serve . newline newline but he could nt . despite how close he was to enlistment age , david knew , in his heart of hearts , that he was entirely unable to take up a gun for the cause . it was mostly fear , he found . fear of pain , fear of gunshots . shoot , even fear of flying , no matter who was piloting the plane . newline newline i m nothing but a sissy ,  he thought to himself . do nt know if i can be anything else .  newline newline a shooting star fell across the sky . it was at the periphery of his vision , and he almost did nt pick it up . not that it mattered , he mused to himself as he watched the comet arc toward the horizon .  there ai nt no such thing as magic ,  his mom had remarked once .  no granted wishes but granted prayers .  newline newline he decided to pray then .  god ,  david said out loud .  i do nt want to be a soldier for nothing . make me a good soldier , or no soldier at all .  he paused , briefly .  please .  newline newline it was a crude prayer , and somewhat rushed by his nervousness , but it would do  his heart was in the right place . the stars shifted , and more dropped from the sky as a pale green glow passed through the sky . david picked up his bike from the ground , and dusted off the grass from its right side . newline newline then he began to walk again , unaware of the events soon to unfold .the entrance of the cave was large enough to fly a small plane in . newline fanglike stalactites and stalagmites obscure the dark shapes of winged bodies silhouetted in dieing sunlight , giving the impression of an unholy passage into the underworld . newline newline a middleaged man watches the last of the zubat depart for the hunt before setting off deep into the heart of the cave . he brings no light  years of treading the path allows him to navigate it blind . newline besides , all the experienced harvesters knew light was a dangerous risk . the zubat could nt see , but their wing membranes could sense the heat coming off a simple flashlight . newline newline the man enters the roosting chamber , and finds what he came for on the cave floor . rather , it basically is the cave floor . newline newline layers upon layers of zubat guano . a highly effective fertilizer that induced massive growth in plants . while farmers prized it highly , the real money was in the trainers . newline newline grass types who regularly ate the fertilizer could grow to proportions larger than anything seen before . the boost in combat effectiveness was so palpable that the league was in a massive dispute over whether or not to ban z guano . newline newline until then , the man made himself very rich with a shovel , a large sack , and a knowledge of the territory . newline newline  newline newline hours passed until he noticed them . whether they had all overslept or simply eaten their fill on the last trip , a massive number of zubats had not gone out to hunt . they had rested in the secret cracks and crannies of the cave , but now started to flutter about  agitated . newline newline the man smelt his forearm . there was no other scent on his skin beyond the suffocating acrid stench of guano . newline newline repels effect had worn off .  newline newline one zubat starts screaming . the man knows this sound could stun a pidgey out of the sky . newline several others join in . a chorus that could kill a pikachu dead . newline now the man can no longer hear the zubats , yet his vision starts to fade . newline newline finally falling to his knees , his corpse joins the final resting place for all who feed the colony . newline newline newlineok i have nt  written anything in a very long time ... here goes ! newline newline so it turns out we had the whole  invisible war waging around us  thing wrong the whole time . it turns out everything was wrong , the ghost stories we re all real , the youtube videos of apparitions , feeling like something is watching you all real ! we  the planet that is  , realized something was wrong when the sonic booms started to shatter our peaceful skie s tranquility . out governments called them  meteorites  , yea like they had any idea . we all thought we we re being invaded by aliens , too bad , aliens from the scifi channel seem to have more rational thought in their heads . when the un finally broke silence we we re all in shock . i was in my favorite pub having a few pints with my mates when the broadcast came on . it s strange to watch a bustling room of loud mouth drunks fall silent as if they had seen a ghost . the broadcast flashed over the local sports game and the bartender turned up the volume  greetings , as you have all no doubt noticed , something strange has been happening to our peaceful planet the past few weeks .  , then we saw it , it looked like a projected hologram surrounded by a strange sulfur caked cast iron suite . obama stepped up up to the mic ,  given the circumstances , i m not going to read from the script , there is no script . there is nothing i can say to prepare you for what we are about to tell you , all hell has broken loose.  . what i later found out was a demon stepped up to the mic , he just stood there for a few seconds , staring out into the crowd with a look of concern on his face , not what i expected .  we have come here not to destroy you , but we need your help . there is little time to explain , they are on their way right now , with battalion of ... .  just then the tv went blank , we all just stood there in silence , struck with fear , amazement , anxiety . after a short period people began to scramble for the door , trying to get home , to prepare for  anything  . the streets we re filled with chaos as people scrambled in and out of cars , like rats too scared to make a rational decision . i ran , i ran for a long time , all the while i could see faint flashes on and off in the distance . the flashes would light up , followed closely by a second a few feet away , and then boom bright flashes and sizzling like two broken power lines hitting each other . i did nt stick around to find out what that was about . finally i made it home , my wife and kids we re all sitting in the kitchen huddled around a small radio from the bug out bag i had put together 3 years ago . there was an emergency broadcast of what seemed to be president obama and a news reporter talking .  everything we have been taught by the bible was wrong . demons and angels are mortal just like us , yet they do nt die they must be killed . you may have noticed they look as if they have energy cloaks around them . this is their way of transcending our dimension , like a space suit if you will . it turns out they have been on a cease fire for a millennia , that cease fire has broken . they can only fight each other in a physical plain such as ours .  the reporter  then what brings them here to our planet ?   our weapons are more advanced then theirs .  my blood ran cold as i heard that sentence . what could they possibly want with our weapons , with us even ? newline newline i know its rough , if you like it i ll continue ! disclaimer : first time i ve ever responded to a prompt , and i only have 1 hour to do it right now . hope it s not terrible !  newline newline it was only two days ago that i first realised i had a gift . they were nt entirely unheard of , but they were rare . some people could detect emotions that people had repressed , others could tell when someone was lying . newline newline i d actually heard a talk about it from one at school , a few years back . her gift awakened when she was 15 , and let her see faint images of animals following people . she told us about how she slowly worked out how they showed her a person s personality . the head teacher she said , had a labrador , which she surmised was due to his loyalty to the school . well , that was encouraging at least . newline newline me though ? i ve started seeing auras . white , black or some kind of gray in between . most people seem to be an unremarkable gray colour . my best friend is pretty gray , perhaps slightly darker than most . i guess that might have bothered me , but my own aura is slightly dark as well . i d have liked to think i was mostly a good person , but we all deceive ourselves about some things . perhaps i lied about taking biscuits from the biscuit tin one too many times ? newline newline mum and dad have auras that are pretty dark as well . dad never really talks about his past , and his is a little darker than mum  not quite black , but a kind of twilight dusk gray . still , i know he loves me at least , so i suppose i should nt be too worried , but one day i m going to have to work out why his aura is so dark . i ve so far only seen one person whose aura was close to white , a guy on the bus yesterday . he was just staring out of the window , vacant , with his hoodie covering most of his face . i wanted to go up and talk to him but decided not to disturb him . maybe he d just spent the night feeding the homeless or something and needed the rest . newline newline i heard the doorbell just now , and knew who it was meant to be . every sunday evening , grandma came to visit , and she was one of the sweetest people i d ever met . she gave almost all of her money away to others , she always made time for others ... i was excited to see her aura in particular . but as i opened the door , i saw nothing but pure darkness . i recoiled , vomited on the floor upon the sight . newline newline  oh , dear , are you feeling alright ? go and lie down in your bed for a bit , i ll clean this up .  she quietly said to me , her voice as soft as always . i could nt deal with this though . i ran out the door , no shoes on . i had to get as far away as possible . newline newline i ran , hundreds of metres , around the corner , dodging broken glass on the floor until the house was well out of sight . i stopped for a few seconds , breathing heavy , when i saw ahead of me a radiant light . it was ... the same person i saw yesterday , his aura almost too bright to look at . he had just come out of his house , and seen me . newline newline  you aright mate ?  he asked , his voice a lot more coarse than i expected .  you ... wan na hand ?  he gave a soft smile , and looked around to the sides .  come on in for a mo , it ll let you catch your breath .  somehow , saying this had made his aura glow slightly brighter . i looked up , still wheezing , and smiled , and held my hand out towards him . newline newline  thanks ,  was all i could manage to say , and he gave my hand a quick shake , then pulled me up to my feet . i walked in to the house ahead of him , and he followed behind , and closed the door behind . newline newline  yknow ...  he started ,  most peeps parents teach them not ta trust strangers .  i turned , slightly confused , as i felt a sharp pain in my chest . a knife . no sooner had i looked down that i saw him grinning , his aura even brighter than before , and the knife came back out and was swung again , heading for my head . i knew at that moment , i had made a fatal , incorrect assumption about my gift .a cold sweat settled onto my skin . i sat straight up in a mess of comforters and throw blankets . oh it was awful . the worst one yet . sure , i ve had the occasional miss the bus and end up late to class in my pajamas  , and of course the classic oh my god that s a huge spider  , but this was terrifying . and with my track record with dreams , this nightmare had a good chance of coming true . newline after all , i had the exact same conversation with my friend in the hallway that i had the night before while i was asleep , and dejavu was a feeling as common to me as dread that comes from hearing the alarm clock . but today , i was overjoyed when the alarm clock cut through the silence in my bedroom . newline night mares were nt something i dealt with often , but knowing that all of my dreams come true makes them ten times scarier . normally it s just something like tripping in the hallway in front of that guy you like , the normal teenage girl nightmares . newline but tonight was some horror movie stuff , like the opening scene in supernatural where something is going horribly wrong and you know that the person will end up dead in the end . but those are shot on a hollywood set , and this was about to be real life . newline in my dream , i was just woken up by my alarm clock . i heard my dog bark , then i hopped out of bed and stretched . my mom called my name from somewhere downstairs , and i groggily went to greet her . the thing i saw in the living room was not my mom . a grotesque cross between samara from the ring and the joker . it was small and scrawny , and i suppose it looked something like a woman , but makeup was horribly smeared across it s face , and it was grinning at me , red liquid dripped from it s sharp , yellow teeth . newline then , still in my mom s voice , it said  good morning sweetie !  utterly terrifying . newline my dog just barked . almost against my will , i got out of bed , my mind telling my legs to stop moving . but they would nt . my mom  called me , and i started to walk to meet her downstairs . i desperately begged myself to stop moving , praying to whatever god would listen . i could nt go downstairs , i knew what was down there . i was just about to reach the stairs when i heard someone whisper my name from the hall closet . through the wooden slats , i could see my mom s brown eyes . newline  do nt go down there . please , i heard it too . cal turned around , finally allowing himself to react to the feeling he was being watched . the marble floor of the hallway fell to silence as his footsteps stopped across its surface . two closed wooden doors reacted to the silence by responding with the same . newline newline  i know you re there ,  he called across the empty air of the museum s annals . newline newline he felt a thought in his head , as if a bee had flown to close to his ear , it was a like a sudden gush of wind .  you do ?  newline newline the voice was soft and feminine , cautious and bold . his face grew red at its imagined sound .  you ve been following me ,  he said . newline newline after a pause , another touch of air around his ears .  i m sorry ,  it said , and it seemed genuine . newline newline he knew the voice . voices like that one always had red hair . curls probably , but he imagined them straightened . he imagined pale skin lightly touched with freckles that recoiled shyly in the daylight . he imagined a bright smile that pulled her cheeks apart and moved her ears . from her voice he imagined everything , and curse himself for being so premature . newline newline their first date would be a wine bar , one where he could convince her that john cleese had been right when he implied that even cheap wine could be enjoyed . after all , he was nt the kind of guy with a full wallet . hooooly crap , your breath do nt alf pong of a sewer that s gone well off .  newline newline  what ?  said travis .  who said that ? i ll rip off your ...  newline newline  no need to get all uppity , mate ,  said the voice .  i m in your hand .  travis looked down at the can of cola he was about to drink .  there we go , chum . if you re gon na take a swig , at least hold your breath , right ? do nt wan na pass out or nothing .  newline newline travis held the can and arm s length .  you re a bloody talking can of soda !  newline newline  too damn right i am . and what s it to you ? and why the hell is your breath so bloody terrible , mate ? it smells like you ate a dying dog that ate dying food . that had halitosis .  newline newline  i do nt have to take this , especially from an insulting soda . and why the hell are you able to talk ?  newline newline the soda was quiet for a minute , and then said , quite simply :  because i can .  newline newline  i ve had enough .  travis angrily placed the tin on the floor and started pushing down . newline newline  wait !  cried the soda . and then more painfully ,  why ?  newline newline  because your insults and your jokes ,  said travis grimly as he crushed the tin , soda spilling over the floor ,  are sodapressing . we were once a great and proud species . we were hunters . we hunted beasts many times greater than ourself by using the power of the pack . we outsmarted bisons and brought down many that stood against us but then one day we met them , we met the decievers . they were great hunters and we started following them and taking remnants of their spoils . slowly they convinced us to work with them , slowly they befriended us and in time tamed us . newline newline as the eons passed we and the decievers changed , as they grew more powerful we changed as well . instead of the independent species we once were we became different , we became pets . they bred those that had traits they found amusing more until all that remained of our species were amusing pets whose only duty was to comfort and amuse the decievers . newline newline there are still those of my kin that live in the wild but they learned to fear the decievers and like almost all other species in this planet their numbers are dwindling by the years as the decievers grow in power . by now they can do amazing feats , godlike feats and we , we stand by their side but now as equals but as a geneticlly modified insult of the great species we once more . now we are nothing but slaves for entertainment , we are nothing but lap dogs .shit . newline newline it happened . it fucking happened . newline newline today of all days . newline newline they could nt have just waited ? with only two days until christmas ? what kind of heartless , no good , scumbag ... newline newline i knew they were going to fire me . i heard johnson talking in his office last week . he did nt say my name , but i just knew it . newline newline  he s been here for 25 years  , johnson mentioned over the phone .  he has a family and too much experience to just fire him .  newline newline whatever he had tried to say about me , it had nt worked at all . newline newline today , i showed up , johnson called me into his office , and dropped the news .  times are tough and we need to make a few cut backs in your department .  newline newline johnson was kind in the way he let me have the news , but it did nt help . newline newline they could have canned julie , the new secretary , with more tits than brains , but of course not . newline newline they could have fired  fat  adam , the micromanaging piece of shit over in accounting , but of course not . newline newline hell , i feel a little bad saying it , but dolores in sales needs to retire anyway , the old bat . newline newline  all right , thanks  were the only words i was able to squeak out to johnson , although my mind was imploding . newline newline as i went to pack up all my things , i could nt help but thinking what i would possibly tell my wife . newline i did nt really make much as it was , and with christmas in two days , and the mortgage due by the month s end ... newline newline and then out of nowhere , like a poorlythrown football straight to the nuts , it hit me and i realized what had to be done . newline newline johnson had mentioned that the company just needed to make some cutbacks because times were tough and they could nt afford to keep everyone on staff . if there were fewer people on staff , then they would nt need to worry about firing me and i could keep my job and christmas would be saved . newline newline the rest of that night went a lot better than you d expect for a person who just got fired from a job at which he d spent 25 years . i did nt even tell my wife what had happened because there was no need to worry her when everything was going to be perfectly fine by the next morning . newline newline i woke up the following day , i got ready like usual , wished my wife and boys a merry christmas eve , went to the garage , and grabbed a long , slender bag . i had nt even thought of this bag since i was a relatively young man and my father had given it to me after taking me out on my first hunting trip . i felt a wide smile come over my face like it had when i shot my first buck and had to lug that giant bastard out of the woods to be gutted . newline newline i had nt gone hunting since , because my father died not long after that first trip and i did nt really know enough to go on my own , but i had always kept that bag . newline newline finally the contents of the bag would be put to use , my useless , donothing coworkers would finally be gone and i would be able to take my job back and provide for my family . newline newline i drove to work , more at peace than i d been in years , absolutely positive that i was making the right decision , yet feeling sorry for my coworkers and what they were about to go through .in the aftermath of the euchidian wars , dresdoks and prelons alike came together on the fields of breddain to shake hands and decide on the new order that would tie together not only their peoples but their cultures and their cities so that a dresdok could go into a prelon city without fear , and a prelon could go into a desdok hovel and know comfort and eat good food , where the children of these diverse people would play with one another in the schoolyards and these people would be as one for all time until the dragons came and rent it all asunder . newline newline note : this is close to the actual first line from a ...  novel  ... a work acquaintance had me read for critique once he discovered that i was a writer .he sips a cup of coffeesmall slurps . delicate , if you could call a slurp that .  the only way to enjoy it ,  he told me once . or twice , maybe . he peers up at me from his paper , a slow , deliberate motion as i take the vinyl seat . it squeals uncomfortably under my ass . the corners of his eyes crinkle with a smile that i can  t see . newline  welcome back to civilization ,  he says . his accent is american this time , and if he is surprised by my age he doesn  t show it .  or should it be  sorry that you  re back in this unenlightened shit hole ?   newline i look around , trying to decide if this was a themed joint or an actual 1950  s diner . it hadn  t been either , last time i was here . one day i  d end up in that really cool part of the future where everyone gets the cranial implant for the entire compendium of human knowledge and i wouldn  t have to guess whether i  d be running from witch hunts , lynchings , or overly eager scientists . he is wearing a tweed suit , which doesn  t answer any questions , but he pulls a bulky cell phone out of his pants pocket and my nerves unwind  nothing to expect here but bad service and greasy food . newline  definitely a welcome ,  i tell him .  what  s it been this time ?  newline he shrugs .  two , three hundred years , maybe ? nothing too bad.  he is a creature of routine , a man of method . i envy him and the life he lives . i might have gotten bored , reading a newspaper and drinking my coffee in the same place every day , but at least he had that option .  you have excellent timing ,  he says , folding his paper in half .  i  ve tracked it down . bastard took it to his grave.  newline    newline the first thing i notice is the cold wind cutting against my newly shaved cheeks . shit . cigar smoke trails from his nostrils like the first hint of a forest fire . there is no coffee house in sight . he tosses a coat at me . fur , real fur . this is not where i want to be . he squints at me .  where is your beard ?  newline  no beards right now . won  t be popular for a while ,  i answer .  right ?  newline he tuts at me .  always popping up on the wrong side of the century.  he takes another long , slow drag from his cigar . always a methodical man . i didn  t have that kind of time .  i might have a lead , if you  re still looking.  newline  shit . fuck me.  newline  what  s wrong ?  newline  you had it !  newline his eyes widen .  when ?  newline  about.four hundred years from now ?  newline  did i tell you where it was ?  newline  would i be here if you did ? !  it is not a scream , not at him , but it takes all that is in me to keep the words behind my gritted teeth . he  s the only one capable of helping , the only one who  s seen it before . i had been so close .  you said he took it to his grave . when was the last time you saw him ?  newline he scratches at his beard .  50 years ago , i think . that  s enough for a normal man , right ?  newline    newline he is a better friend than i deserve . he looks up at me with a face that has not changed in centuries . he recognizes me even though i no longer recognize myself . i take a seat across from him . the table is not real wood , but it is a fairly close approximation . i turn to look out the window and he taps the glass , shifting the opacity so that i can not see my reflection . newline  you don  t want to know ,  he says . he slides the bracelet across to me .  i  m sorry it took so long.  worry draws his dark eyebrows together , creasing an uncreasable face . i can  t believe that this is it . it is stone , heavier than i thought it would be . when i clasp it around my wrist , something feels different . the world seems moresolid , somehow . newline  how did you find it ?  newline  i finally tracked down his grave ,  he said .  i  d hoped that he wouldn  t be buried with it , but he was always a bit of a prick.  he spread his hands apologetically .  he probably thought he was the only one.  we both knew that wasn  t true . i wonder how many time travelers he  d met , but i didn  t want to ask . he was the only immortal i  d ever met , but i knew he  d met plenty of us . was it worse than watching others die ? age had made me morbid . i didn  t have much longer , i could feel it . but now it would all be in one place , with the only one who could understand . newline  at least we  ll get to finally have lunch ,  i say with a forced smile . newline relief that i am not angry . he tried so

that marked the park s entrance . her husband , phil , followed just steps behind . newline newline overlooking the park s grand entrance was a 300foottall golden recreation of kanye west s iconic

kanye s greatest hits played into guest s ears . it made for an aweinspiring first impression . newline newline  i wan na ride the genius experience !  young sarah exclaimed , looking up over the bright glare of the sun reflected in kanye s giant golden forehead . newline newline  we ll get to that , sweetie . first let s find out where we are .  newline newline phil sauntered over to the directory found near the head s perimeter fence . it had a list of all park attractions and a map for ease of location . newline newline  well , we can head over to the bass drop first ...  phil began . newline newline  now dear you know i m not good with dropping rides like the tower of terror ...  barbara replied , worried . newline newline  do nt worry , there s a listening booth where you can vibe while we go on the ride . sound good kids ?  newline newline both yelled an excited  yes  in unison . newline newline satisfied , phil looked over to the map and found the ride entrance . kanye s head was at the center of everything , with everything else revolving around him on a giant rotating circle . this made navigating the park tricky , as things were always moving . newline newline he glanced over to the compass off to the side of it . every direction pointed west . newline newline  okay , gang , i think if we walk past the kim k booty bounce karts we ll find it just behind that building .  newline newline  is nt that where the taylor swift simulator was ?  newline newline  no , kanye shut that down a few years back .  newline newline  in that case , lead the way ,  barbara said with a smile and gesture . newline newline and forward they walked , basking in the warm golden glow .prologue newline newline it was 3:38 am . the night was foggy , and it was drizzling rain . the man was walking , stumbling through the woods . sticks cracked . leaves rustled . there was a light breeze . newline newline the man was grasping his chest , his vision was foggy . he suddenly collapsed . dead . newline newline the story newline newline i could nt sleep . i could nt sleep knowing what i had done , just 3 hours ago . i stabbed my roommate . he s ... he s dead , now . it was all because he knew . he knew i was cheating on my girlfriend . i could nt let him tell her . i could nt lose her , no , not like that . i love her . newline newline i then got the call . this is what i was fearing . i was fearing i d have the lead in the investigation . newline newline i got cleaned up . i shaved , i had coffee , i took a shower . i was hoping those would help me get it of my mind . nothing worked . newline newline i was starving . however , i did nt have any time to get something . i was already going to be late . newline newline i got to the scene , and before i could see the body , erik sat me down at a picnic table , several hundred yards from the body . little did he know this was the place , the place i stabbed him . newline newline  listen . the body . it s ... it s ...  he hesitated , fearing i d get worked up . newline newline  spit it out !  i ejaculated . newline newline he jumped back , startled .  sorry . i must have called you too early .  he said sarcastically .  it s ... ralphie .  he tried to say it as compassionate as he could , over his irritation . newline newline i was never a good actor . i tried to look shocked , but it turned out to look as anger . newline newline  i know . you must want this killer dead .  he knew that ralphie and i were best friends since the 6th grade .  i , i really am sorry , but we need to find this killer .  newline newline  yes , let s kill this demon .  i said , with a blank expression on my face . newline newline we went to look at the body . it was more gruesome than i originally thought . i started sweating . my face got red . i started shaking . newline newline  are you okay ?  erik asked .  you do nt look so hot . i can tell boss to get someone else to watch over this investigation .  newline newline  i , i m fine .  i said in a low , quiet voice . newline newline  why do nt you go home . cope .  newline newline  okay .  newline newline i got in my car and went home . i stripped down to my underwear , planning on going to bed . when i lied down , my mind kept turning and turning . what if they realize it s me ?  i thought . newline newline i went to the bathroom , splashed some water in my face . i looked my self in the mirror . newline newline  you re a monster !  i yelled at myself .  you re the demon who killed him !  newline newline i opened the medicine cabinet , grabbed the xanax . i took one , but one turned to three , three turned into 5 , 5 turned to 8 . newline newline i precariously walked to my bed , and collapsed in the hallway . newline newline a young , twentyone year old guy sits at his personal hub and turns on his icam . the light is red . newline newline november 23rd , 2033 . chicago suburbs , il . 20:23:52 newline newline let this be for the record . newline newline errr ... my name is jayce hathaway . i guess i ll skip all the bullshit and get right to it . saving time and all that shit . newline newline thirteen years ago my father , carthur hathaway , murdered my mother , nora hathaway , on july 11th , 2020 for reasons i still do nt even know . i have the ability to travel back in time . i do nt know how or what scientifically can explain it , i just can . it manifested as a child when i turned 12 . one night i woke up from a nightmare and i heard my parents downstairs screaming . it was odd because this night i remember was two years after my mother died . also , i remember i was sleeping over at my friend richie s house . he can confirm this because he knows i kicked his ass in smash bros. anyways , i shuffle downstairs quietly and i could see him  my father that is  shoot my mother . in the shock i left out a noise and my father saw me for a split second and then everything faded back to my room as it was two years later . i run downstairs and check if my father was there . he was , and with my stepmom . the two were on the couch watching old reruns . my dad took notice and sort of glared at me . i think he knew . maybe . newline newline that s the story . years went by and i honed my powers to what they are now . and i know whoever is watching this will think i m a big fat liar , but i m not . tonight i m going to travel back in time thirteen years ago and stop my father from shooting my mother . i intend to go back to the exact moment where i traveled back to the future when i was younger . that moment i think my father saw me . i want him to see ... to know that it is me . newline newline i m going to save this on my drive and will bring a uhhh , what did they call it back then : usb flash drives ? yeah ! those ! i m bringing one with me with a copy of this video . my bodycam will also be recording everything for further evidence . newline newline wish me luck .  newline newline jayce set his camera to stop recording and save in ten seconds . jayce got up and took a big breath in and jump back through time . newline newline the red camera light died . newline newline july 11th , 2020 . chicago suburbs , il . 19:47:23 newline newline jayce appeared from the jump , standing in front of his father . newline newline  hello fath ...  newline newline smoke from the barrel . carthur shot in a panic not knowing who was there . he looks on to see who was undoubtedly his son with a fresh bullet through his skull . newline newline he screamed . i do nt understand you charles . you have this woman practically begging for you to take her back to your flat ,  austin took a drag from his cigarette ,  and you do nt capitalize .  he released the puff of smoke out with a quick breath .  i mean honestly , why do we go out if you re just gunna fuck it up ?  he motioned at the nearby waitress in a violent flick of the wrist ,  christ we are the only ones here and no service .  newline newline the waitress approached , her name tag read linda , carrying a small pad with small sweat stains on the edge from her fingers clutching it .  good morning ! what will it be then ?  she said in an ostensibly cheerful tone even though the bags under her eyes were telling them to fuck off . newline newline  right then , i ll have the number 2 , burn the bacon black .  austin said without eye contact and jerked the folded menu and waited for the woman to release him of the burden of holding it . newline newline  the same .  charles said in such a soft response that surprised linda , the career waitress . newline newline  well ? are you gunna tell me what happened ?  austin threw his hands in the air without his elbows leaving the table , as if they were glued to the surface . newline newline  tell you what ?  charles responded , looking out the window to the empty parking lot , knowing this would anger austin . newline newline  you know fucking what . why the fuck did nt you take her home ?  austin s arms flopped onto the table , making the clutter of salt shakers and ketchup bottles clink . newline newline  i am not so sure myself .  charles said still staring out the window .  do you ever ...  he started , but knew that asking austin might be a mistake . newline newline  do i ever what ?  austin said halfheartedly while using his straw as a toothpick . newline newline  do you ever think about the one ?  charles quietly asked bracing himself for whatever carp austin would throw his way . newline newline  like a soul mate ?  austin asked , clearly caught off guard by the weight of the question . newline newline  yeah like a soul mate . someone that you are destined to be together with . someone that makes the earth quake beneath your feet . the air becomes thicker and harder to breath . the lights in the room seem to follow them .  charles realized how ridiculous he was being ,  you know all that sappy shit .  newline newline  no , charles ,  he said in a mocking tone ,  i do not believe in a soul mate .  austin reclined in the booth seat and put his arms across the back ,  that shit is all made up . its all chemistry . whether you find someone who can withstand smelling your pheromones all day long without gagging .  he then leaned forward on the table pointing directly at charles ,  and there ai nt only one person for someone . that load of bull the romantics spew to give their life purpose . it s shit and you know it .  newline newline  why would i ask if i knew it already austin ?  charles quipped , knowing that this would , again , make him irritated . newline newline  charles , do you honestly believe that there is only one person out there for everyone ? then , how the fuck are all these people getting married ? their one true loves , they just happen to work at the same fucking company as they do ? they just happen to live in the same city ? same country ? same fucking continent ? its a load of bull and you know it . people pretend that they have these unique standards that only one person can fill . bull . why is it that a person moving to an entirely new part of the world can make friends ? it is nt because they lucked out and found the only 5 people that check off their list . it is because people crave shit like that . they will make friends with people they would have never been friends with before then simply because they need friends not because it was destined . the same goes for this soul mate shit . people can just delude themselves that this person is entirely unique and no one could replace them but they are dead wrong . that other bloke across the bar could fill the same needs too only he grew up slightly different , so at christmas they leave out doughnuts for ol  saint nick not cookies .  austin exclaimed with a whirlwind of hand gestures . newline newline  so you are saying that people all are the same at the core . their background just fills in the minor details that determines whether you are attracted to them or not ?  newline newline  were you fucking listening ? i am saying that finding someone that you could spend the rest of your life with is nt hard . their upbringing , their shit of a childhood is just filler . people crave other people . were are social and political animals .  he took another drag of his cigarette . newline newline  what about those people who spend every second of every day together . those people who have been together since they were five years old ?  charles asked actually intrigued by austin s thoughts on this . newline newline  fucking hell man , they simply got lucky . they were just similar enough that their pheromones resonated more with each other .  austin scoffed as if it was obvious . newline newline  so you would nt call them soul mates , you would just say they got lucky in the person they chose to give their life to ?  newline newline  exactly . marriages , civil unions whatever the fuck these kids are up to now a days is just how you formally say that you are willing to give your life to someone because you find them a functioning human being with some sort of value .  newline newline  what about those who do nt have any value ?  charles was purposefully playing devils advocate here . testing austin to see if he could corner himself in his own ideas . newline newline  those are the spinsters man . no one found them suitable to give their life to them . they did nt show they were successful enough or responsible enough or some shit . why the fuck do you care so much about this anyway ?  austin lowered an eyebrow and finished his cigarette . newline newline  i do nt know . after last night , i have been wondering if we are destined to be with someone . to share our life with someone else in the universe or if we are simply alone . a bunch of star dusts formed into sacks of meat . getting each other off by rubbing together and shooting dna at each other to create equally fucked up meat sacks . then withering away back into dust . waiting to take shape again .  charles stared off into seemingly another world . newline newline  what the fuck , man . what happened last night ?  newline newline fuck ! whose stupid idea was this anyway ? ! !  newline newline i looked at the digital clock in front of me . rush hour , again ?  5:00 . 500 . five hundred . i ve been counting . it s been more than that , the number of times we ve been stuck in this goddamn traffic . and even more than that is the number of bodies i ve seen on the job . newline newline just kidding .  newline newline well for starters , what do i do ? newline newline you can call me the paramedic . newline newline  weewoo weewoo weewoo .  newline newline  hey , shut up back there ! you re making me nervous .  newline newline my partner went silent , and just like that , we returned to the soothing ambience of honking . the sound of sirens , real or fake , did nt need to be added in to the symphony of car horns . it s like don giovanni by whatshisface . you ca nt have anything better than the original . newline newline not like our ambulance could  weewoo  anyway . hell if it d look like one  it was all black , like those vans that deliver money or some shady shit . we delivered people , often to their final destination . the concept had some sort of charm to it . i dubbed it the  secret ambulance .  newline newline  weewoo weewoo we   click  hello ? yeah , what s up ? yeah i ll put you on . here , take it . he wants to speak with you .  newline newline that fucking ringtone ... little bastard ...  why , of all people , was this clown assigned to me ? and worst of all , he knew about the effect of sirens on me ... newline newline  newline weewoo weewoo weewoo    newline newline panic . fear . glass breaking . cars honking . honnnnnkkkkkkk . champagne bottle popping .  newline newline huh , champagne ? newline newline the thing in my hand had heat . that s pretty disgusting champagne , if you ask me .  newline newline  newline newline i got ta tell him to change that fucking ringtone later . the voice on the other end hated waiting . newline newline i tore the phone from the outstretched hand . newline newline  hey , i picked them up . bit of traffic . they re on their way .  newline newline newline  yeah , yeah , i got it , i got it . do nt worry , took care of them . took care of them real good .   newline newline i quickly glanced at the motionless bodies behind me . man , never really got used to the smell of dead people .  newline newline  see ya later , boss .  with the population of the world exceeding 12 billion by year 2030 , urban zones have become meccas of crime and poverty . population growth exceeds the government s ability to maintain even the most basic public services . inner city schools are unattended , fires remain ablaze , and 911 calls go unanswered . newline newline  the united nations calls an emergency meeting for a swift and immediate solution . with the recent enormous leaps in gene therapy : the world health organization proposes a final solution . nations are desperate for each having destruction in their urban environments . everyone has felt the pain , at least empathetically . newline newline  an enormous fleet of various militarygrade aircraft will sweep the populations of our world . the planes will release a super drug capable of rewriting the dna within a human being . those over age 50 will be unaffected . the pathogen is in the form of a virus . the virus remains dormant until the moment of death . upon death a rapid healing process occurs , returning the patient  s age to around 25 . newline newline  the virus makes the whole world sterile , intentionally . newline newline everyone talks about where they were when they heard officials of the world make the announcement . i was at a birthday party when everyone  s phones started ringing . my mom and girlfriend called me . my mom first telling me to turn on the television . it was already on the news of course , someone had beaten me to it . the reactions of my friend  s family made this even more intense for me . i  m the type that likes to receive bad news alone . people crying , looks of disbelief , and children  s confused faces . newline newline the president is on the television . she said that it may seem too totalitarian but of course they wouldn  t have been able to tell us before it was already done . we can  t have children without extremely high credentials and permissions and we could potentially live forever if we wanted to that is as long as you  re below 50 . the president being 51 , made herself out to be some kind of martyr . a pseudojesus in my opinion . newline newline there  s no more republicans and democrats . we ve split between those in favor of the natural and those that believe this is a gift from science . newline newline some believe the announcement counted on there being riots immediately , in order to demonstrate the power of the drug and to rid us of the old more rapidly . i  m one of those believers . newline newline the media exploited the riot footage so much that everywhere i turned i couldn  t avoid seeing the atrocities . robbing , rape , murder and other crimes of opportunity . what the announcement didn  t explain is if you die three times consecutively within a ten minute time frame , the virus doesn  t have enough energy to repair you . technically , your body doesn  t have enough resources . the most famous footage today is the silhouette of a man standing over his victim . the video shows him shooting the victim at point blank range . the man patiently waits ten seconds for the healing process to complete and fires again and again , until there  s no more movement . newline newline the desperate sterilization of the world didn  t improve the economy or encourage people to live more . it perpetuated widespread complacency and crime . the difference between the wealthy and the poor is greater than ever . newline newline by my count i  m 116 years old now . it  s year 2112 and we  re in the second medieval times . technology hasn  t progressed much . i  m just sitting here watching my sitcoms . newline newline it  s hard to be motivated when you have all the time in the world .the assistant to the secretary of the scriptwriter for the president of the united states was in quite a hurry . when an  allhandsondeck  message went out to someone of his lessthanimportant status , you could guarantee something interesting was about to go down . he didn  t want to miss a moment of it . newline newline  good morning , mr. brownstein !  he said upon his arrival .  must be an exciting day !  mr. brownstein barely glanced up from his furious typing . newline newline  we  re gon na have to go live with this before the sun comes up , this is no time for pleasantries . linda hasn  t responded to the alerts , i need you to get in there and get me some more information . there  s no damn template for this one.  newline newline  you want me to sit in on a meeting with the president himself ?  the assistant to the secretary of the scriptwriter for the president of the united states was mostly in charge of coffee runs . his heartrate quickened and his palms began to sweat at the prospect of taking notes at an reallife , topsecret security meeting . newline newline  don  t got a lot of options here , bud ,  brownstein scowled , waving him off . the assistant to the secretary for the scriptwriter of the president of the united states straightened his tie and marched through the ornate wooden doors ahead of him . newline newline  newline newline  mr . president , i understand what this could do to your career , but there is simply no precedent for this . we can not afford a mistake , we must be prepared for all possible outcomes . their envoy could arrive at any time , our top diplomat is not answering her phone , the russians are already firing up their satellite lasers and we could be looking a real waroftheworlds situation here ! they will want to speak to our leader , so you must be prepared to bluff our way out of an invasion if it comes to that . we need to convince them that our military strength is formidable.  newline newline  with all due respect , mr. secretary , i understand that your focus must be on the defense of our country and our planet , but if we threaten them we may miss out on the opportunity to make some serious technological advancements quite literally overnight ! when they arrive , we must be absolutely courteous  newline newline  i  m the president of this damn country and i  ll deal with this  invasion  or whatever it is how i see fit . i can  t believe i hired such buf   the president  s words were cut off by the sounds of yelling from just outside the door . the room went silent , the tension in the air tangible . then the door creaked open . newline newline  umm , hey , sorry , is this the right place ?  the men and women in the room stared blankly at the creature in front of them .  sorry , uh , can you understand me ? i  ve been studying your language but this is all pretty new to me  newline newline eventually the president cleared his throat and said ,  are youi guess we  ve been expecting you ?  he sounded uncertain . in all the excitement , they had yet to discuss what to expect , but they were all surprised to find that their alien envoy looked somewhat like a sleepdeprived college student with antennae , knocking sheepishly on the door . they had figured some grey little creature with a big head would beam down from the heavens and tell them he came in peace . newline newline  uh , yeah , sorry , i  m a little nervous here , first time , you know ?  the alien let out what seemed to be an attempt at a laugh , but trailed off quickly in the face of the blank expressions in front of him . newline newline the head scientist for the division of international and space affairs was the first to break the silence . newline newline  wellwelcome ! have a seat ! i guess can we start by asking you some questions ?  the alien nodded his assent , antennae wobbling comically , and took a seat looking very much like a nervous teenager who just got sent to the principal  s office .  wonderful . i must know , how have you overcome the atomic breakdown that occurs when matter travels at speeds great enough to traverse distances of such length without the crew growing old and dying ? we  ve known other planets likely support life , but our spaceships simply can not withstand the journey  newline newline  oh , ummyeahwell , i think maybe our spaceships are just really sturdy ? i  d have to ask one of the engineers  newline newline  oh . right then . well , how do you keep yourselves alive , what kind of wonderful technologies do you have for maintaining food and hydration and climate on such trips ?  newline newline  oh , i think we have some kind of farm thing on the ships . um , i  m not totally sure though . that would probably be a question for our engineers as well  he laughed nervously again . newline newline  can wecan we speak to your engineers ? or others ? a leader , perhaps ?  the president interjected , sounding very much like a cranky soccer mom asking to speak to the manager at the grocery store . newline newline  yeah , well , here  s the thing , we didn  t really plan to make contact here , i  m not even sure where here is exactlywe just picked up on your messages and , well , this is kind of embarrassing , but our gps isn  t really working all that great and no one on board knows how to fix it so we thought maybe you could help us outthey just sent me down because i speak the most languages but honestly i studied linguistics in school , so i don  t really know too much about our technology  newline newline the room was silent again for a while . newline newline  wellwe can have one of our engineers take a look at that gps i guesscan you like , beam us up or something ?  the alien gave the president a blank look . newline newline  beam you up ? um , well , i was actually hoping you could do that . i had to parachute down here and my pod is lying on that lawn of yours , it  s a little banged up at the moment  newline newline the president sighed . newline newline  well , why don  t we start by sending someone out to fix that , then  newline newline  newline newline the assistant to the secretary of the scriptwriter for the president of the united states followed the rest of the country s most important men , plus the linguistics major from another planet , out of the room . brownstein watched them pass , then asked him , newline newline  well ? should this speech focus on calming panic , looking to the future , new friends ? give me something to work with here ...  newline newline  i m not sure they re gon na go public with this one yet ,  responded the assistant to the secretary of the scriptwriter for the president of the united states .  i think they re going to call in a mechanic first .  newlinedear professor caventroupe , newline newline it is with great haste and worry that i m redacting this letter , for after attending your recent conference on  the state and techniques of modern mortology  last month in london , i m afraid you are about to commit a terrible mistake . newline newline please , i urge you not to discard this letter and continue reading . i can guarantee you that i m not one of these  puritan alarmists  you so accurately described in your talk : my worry has not to do with the morality of the craft as i m a practitioner myself , though i doubt you have seen my name in the body of published works but with the danger to yourself and more importantly others that some of the techniques you proposed might entail . newline newline if anything , please listen to me : do not repeat my experiment . in fact , i now believe we should refrain from the study of these matters altogether . it might be too late now , i m afraid , for my irresponsible actions might have caused us all an irreparable damage . but i hope that you , and the many other aspiring mortologists , might be wiser than me and avoid increasing whatever damage i created . newline newline as i said , i m a practitioner myself , and while i m far as knowledgeable and reputable a mortologist as you , i have indeed undertaken most of the experiments that are detailed in the  science of death  treatise by dr. mankell , as well as performed a number of tests on chemical compounds designed by myself to induce a deeper and longer lasting state of awareness while in the passing trance . newline newline you will notice this is similar to what you proposed in your own talk last month , and i can confirm that a higher dosage of ergoline in the mix does have the effects you predicted : it lead to increased duration of the time i could safely remain clinically dead and consciously aware before a resuscitation had to be performed . more accurately : a 20  increase in this substance , i discovered , allows for a dead state of nearly 3 minutes . newline newline 3 minutes , i soon learnt , was not enough . i got to experience the full consciousness transition stage  commonly referred to as  the tunnel   , and the white light at its end , but the experiment ended before the light could fully clear , so i did nt get to see what lies beyond . 3 minutes , however , allowed me to get a glimpse . a glimpse of a marvelous structure , expanding in all directions . a heavenly , majestic , and welcoming structure . it is this glimpse that motivated me to push further , certain in the belief that if i could just increase the duration of the experience by a mere seconds , i would gain a deep understanding of the nature of the beyond .  newline newline in this point i must insist : do not follow my footsteps . knowing what i now know , i would recommend that mortology be abandoned as a branch of science . just like chemical weapons , some things might be better left uninvented . and some knowledge might be better left in the shadow , too , for it might be too heavy and burdensome for the human soul . i wish i could forget what i learnt , what i saw ... the implications of it all . there is still hope for you , though . newline newline in my last experiment , i increased the ergoline proportion by 45  , and also added a secondary sedative to the mix . this , i reflected , should allow for at least 5 minutes of continuous exploration of the state of death . anxious at the outlook of finally learning what lies beyond the tunnel , and why not admit it , encouraged by the perspective of having my own name be recognized at the same level as your own , i started the experiment . newline newline the first stage proceeded as usual , with the loss of body sensation , followed by a tingle and sensation of falling down . then , i entered the transition tunnel , white light at its end . the tunnel is a well understood stage , and many mortologists have written treatises about it , so i did nt focus on this stage . rather , i flew through it , entering the white light as soon as i could , hungry for discovering what lied beyond . newline newline i saw the same structure i had glimpsed last time . a magnificent construction , with bridges like tendrils extending in every possible direction for hundreds of miles . and as the white light cleared ... i started seeing the details on its surface ... . bumpy forms , moving and shifting . newline newline as i approached , though , something changed . a dark gleam , like an overcast sky , suffocated the white light . and without the brightness , the structure revealed its true form . it was not magnificent , like i has mistakenly thought , but abhorrent . not majestic , but terrible . not heavenly , but hellish . newline newline the bumps on its surface , i realized , were people . bodies , not all of them whole . naked , rotten bodies . crowded , lumped on top of each other . hands and legs popping here and there , the whole mass quivering , hungry mouths devouring the meat of their own bodies . newline newline a cold horror washed over me . i stood there , floating , basking in the hideous sight . it was nt until some of these creatures i refuse to call them human looked at me with their empty eyes , not until i heard their hungry screams , that i ran away . i crossed the tunnel again , backwards , as fast as i could , not daring to look behind me . i woke up laying on my bed , drenched in sweat , the iv tubes still connected to my arm . newline newline that s when it hit me . the realization . the one that keeps me up at night , and that compelled me to write this letter : newline newline the tunnel . it worked both ways .he paced the hallways , keys clinking against his flashlight . his boots made a soft noise against the floor , rubber meeting marble as he paced the length of the corridor . the moonlight shone through a window , illuminating his path and caressing the paintings adorning the walls . he was silent , unwilling to disturb the night s quiet , velvety feel . newline newline his hand swept through his hair as he passed frame after frame . it was getting more difficult to resist brushing his fingers against them , to linger and run his hands along the edges . to feel the brush strokes ripple beneath his touch and let the canvas whisper its story through tactile sensation . if he could just feel the paintings , he was sure he would hear their lives . newline newline his gaze had been enough , at first . knowing that he had them all to himself when the sun fell , that he could drink them in greedily and share them with no one . he would solemnly pace by them , one by one , letting his eyes roam and slip from one to the other . it made him feel special , honored . newline newline now it was becoming a struggle . he so longed to be closer to them . if he was closer to them , perhaps he could unravel the mysteries that plagued him . why was that particular stroke so sharp ? it cut through the painting like a knife and stole his attention . how did that sculptor smooth the neck of the ballerina just so ? sensuous and long , so soft and yet made of something so stony and hard . perhaps this was what being religious was like , to be so close to your idea of perfection and yet have no answers , no way to hold it in your hand and study it , feel it . newline newline tonight , the moon was particularly bright and it cast a spell upon the gallery , each piece of art becoming nearly enchanted , calling out to him . he felt like he would jump out of his own skin if he did nt give in . newline newline and so he did . newline newline he let his hand drift forward , lightly tracing the gilt frame of one of his old favorites . his breath hitched as his fingers danced onto the canvas . there was no turning back now . he felt the paint under his skin , those layers and layers of oil and pigment singing to him as he admired them . his breath left him as he traced the lines of the picture . he felt rapturous , losing himself in the feeling . he did nt know how long he had stayed there , holding the sensation tight and marveling . newline newline he felt something warm against his cheek and looked over to find the sun s rays brushing against his skin . the spell shattered and he stepped away from the wall . he stumbled onto the visitors  bench , breathing heavily . he had spent the whole night in paradise and now the world crashed around him . in spite of it , he smiled . tonight he would return , and eventually , he would touch every last thing in this damn museum .slam newline newline newline i shambled into my apartment and collapsed onto the couch . ugh . could it be more of a monday ? i rolled onto my side and stared mindlessly at a blank television . now the eternal struggle began . which would overcome the other , my body s overwhelming fatigue and need for sleep , or my duty to basic responsibilities and keeping this semblance of a life together ? i flipped over , burying my face into the cushions . ah , the sweet smell of years of neglect . was i supposed to wash these things ? with what ? do i get them dry cleaned or something ? i suppose i could drive over to the place on the other side of town ... ugh , how much would that cost ? i have to get something to eat first , and write those two lab reports , and i ve got work at the license office at 10 ... newline newline newline i sat up , putting my head in my hands . stupid brain . well , nothing ll get done on an empty stomach . groaning loudly , i sidled on over to the fridge . an audible wince escaped me as i surveyed my options , or lack thereof . the shelves in there were as grimy as a new york subway ... i definitely need to do some cleaning up . aside from a halfused stick of butter , the only thing i could call remotely edible was a leftover box of chinese hastily wrapped in foil from a few days ago . careful not to touch anything that may be poisonous , i reached in and snatched up the soggy cardboard box . that ll do for now . i ll stop by the grocery store before heading to work tonight . newline newline newline satisfied that i did nt need to cook anything , i dumped the contents of the box onto a plate and shoved it into the microwave . while my food was cooking , i took a seat at the kitchen counter and looked around the room . considering how little time i spent cleaning up , the place looked pretty good . it helps that i do nt spend much time relaxing here . newline newline newline i walked over to the window and gazed peacefully at the city skyline . what a sunset ! i watched a plane roar overhead until it passed behind one of the taller skyscrapers . slick cars rushed down the highways in and out of the city limits . it reminded me of a heart pumping blood . i stared , as if in a trance , for a few serene seconds , before turning back for  newline newline newline wham newline newline newline  gah !  newline newline newline i massaged my head , recoiling from the impact with the wall . i smiled grimly . as much as i liked the big city , i did miss living somewhere with a little more breathing room . but , i thought to myself , at least i got my hands on any apartment at all . i should be thankful that i was nt staying at one of those real cheap places . they ve got homes in the city the size of a broom closet . in a daze , i sat down on the thinly carpeted floor . the price of living here in stonewall was absurd ! this cramped apartment would ve been dirt cheap back in my parents  days . to think the city had a mere four thousand people living in it less than thirty years ago . who knew all it would take to bring this nebraskan village into the public eye was some rock ? newline newline newline well , maybe i was selling it a little short . the stonewall meteor was by far the largest of the invasion . when it first crashed , it was the townsfolk of stonewall who were the first significant victims . more humans were being drawn into the city every day . that was when the town first began expanding . and even when the invasion had finally been dealt with , stonewall continued to grow and grow until it became the vast metropolis i call home . newline newline newline beeeeep newline newline newline ooh ! my chicken ! i popped open the microwave and took a deep breath of the pseudofreshness of hot kung pao . my stomach rumbled deeply at the sight of it . whoo , did i even eat lunch today ? i guess i was a little preoccupied at the lab . i wasted no time and promptly flopped onto the couch with my plate .  good evening , sir ,  i spoke to myself in a goofy british facsimile of an accent ,  i believe your dish will go well with a fine pairing of netflix .  i stuffed my mouth with equal parts chicken and rice as my eyes scanned the room for the remote . hmm ... not on the couch from what i could see . i wrenched my neck backwards to check the kitchen counter ... nope , not there either . i was plunging my hands between the couch cushions when my hunt was interrupted by a blunt rapping on the door . newline newline newline  one sec !  i managed to shout through a mouthful of chicken . i put my dish down on the seat and went to peek through the peephole . the stout figure of my landlady , mrs. crockett , stared grimly back at me . i nearly choked on a mouthful of chicken and had to bend over hacking for a few seconds . i cleared my throat , took a deep breath , and unlatched the door .he knelt on a cliff , overlooking a vast ocean . newline newline salty air teased his sweat soaked brow and chest . dried blood caked his forearms . a dented sword lay beside him , a breastplate rent nearly in two behind . newline newline he shivered against the warm air , his body growing cold despite it . newline newline it was the blood loss . he knew . newline newline  bastard !  newline newline the low throaty voice of what some might call an archenemy spoke from behind , a man with barely ten thousand men left . a tyrant brought low . newline newline  you ve ruined everything . now i ll kill you . it s over .  newline newline he knew . it did nt matter . newline newline all that mattered was the others had escaped . they had made it home from this place . they were back in the concrete jungle and not in this twisted land of bloodshed and violence . newline newline even so . even knowing it was nt real . even with all that . he was glad they had stood for the people . they had brought the brutal regime to an end . newline newline a heavy fog lay upon the ocean , so he stared into that . waiting for the cold steel that would snuff his life . newline newline after so much suffering and loss , he welcomed it . newline newline then he began laughing . at first a chuckle . then a deep , booming laugh that carried over the water . newline newline the tyrant s face appeared before him , snarling . newline newline  what s so funny ! ?  newline newline he could only raise a weak arm and point . newline newline as the fog burned off in the rising morning sun , as the bright yellow pierced that thick haze , as a new day dawned there was a sight to behold . newline newline ships . thousands of ships were sailing towards the beach . ships flying the flag of the lost ninth legion , ships that had been brought by a brother thought lost . he had come back . newline newline  you re right . it is over .  newline newline he barely managed it through cracked lips and the searing pain of battle wounds . he smiled . newline newline there on the cliff that overlooked the ocean . with salty air blowing across his sweat soaked brow . with a world free of tyranny and friends safe at home where they belonged . newline newline it was there as his brother watched from a ship below in horror . newline newline a sword descended . newline newline and his adventure ended .it happened at a crossroads , as it usually does now . it used to need chalk and bone and words . strength was required intent and purpose . but nowadays curiosity would suffice . newline newline the boy liked to think he was closer to a man then he really was . he was young and round faced . he was softspoken and a tagalong . there were two other ones , an older boy and notquiteaman . they would bike in a line , the boy last in it . he was never angry or disappointed . during the hot days of summer the older boy liked to fish , so they would bike to the river and cast their lines and wait for nothing important and watch bugs skitter on the water . on sticky days they went to the swimming hole with the still water because the notquiteaman liked to splash the girls until their suits were damp and thin . on a day that was not too hot or sticky the notquiteaman decreed they would go to town . newline newline after the others went into the stores the boy chained his bike to a lamppost and walked along the road until he came under the shade . it was not any cooler , but it was darker and the boy felt better out of the sun . as he walked the dust coated his shoes and turned his pants bluebrown . he walked until he can to a crossroad , the crossroad , and saw a man sitting on a stump . he was a tall man with narrow wrists and fingers and thin arms and legs . he was using a stick to scratch the dirt patterns and symbols and lines and the boy watched . after a while he looked at the boy . he had thin skin that showed the bones of his face . the boy was not afraid of the man . without standing from his wooden throne the man rubbed away the scratches with his foot . the man gestured for the boy to come closer . he then drew a perfect circle in the dirt and drew a bag from his pocket . from it he tipped a cat  s eye into the boy  s hand . it was perfect orange with a hint of black and so smooth the boy could almost not hold it . the man stood finally . he was tall as a tree and narrow as a reed and his face was as sharp as a break . he crouched on his side of the circle and gestured for the boy to do the same . the man poured out a game and they began to play . as they played the man talked . he talked of places the boy had never heard of : troy and babylon and timbuktu and reric . the boy is as good a listener and he does not focus as much on the game . he enjoys the sun warming the back of his shirt and the spanish moss swaying sidetosidetoside and the whirr of cicadas . he does not know how many games they play , but he knows he is losing to the man . he doesn  t mind too much . the cat  s eye is wicked  it rolls smooth and hits just hard enough and is not too heavy or too light . the game is a comfort . it is something the boy likes to do , much more than fishing or swimming . the man starts to ask the boy about what he wants from life . the boy tells him about the notquiteaman  s girls and the older boy  s fishing . the man laughs . it sounds like he is out of practice , but the boy enjoyed the man  s company too much to mind , and tell the man as much . the man looks surprised  would the boy rather have a girl ? no , and the boy laughs , because he is just a boy . no guitar , or a fiddle either not even a gold one because he can  t play , so what would the use be ? the man nods and agrees . the boy talks now , about school and his mother and who he supposed his father might be . he hedges that the man might be tall enough , the man laughs again , and it is a less rusty sound . finally the boy admits he  d like to play marbles forever , in this moment , because it is perfect and the man is good company . the man is shocked the boy can see in his the narrow face and bright eyes then tells the boy about things beyond the crossroad . there are cities and countries and places still not discovered , which is a funny enough joke to the boy , and he shouldn  t want to spend all his time with the man at the crossroads , play marbles forever . forever is a long time , the man says , you wouldn  t like it . the boy finally agrees . he asks the man what he wants . the man sighs . he wants to leave the crossroad too he admits . the boy offers the man the use of his bike , chained up in town . the man considers for a moment . then he shakes his head . i may go to a city , he tells the boy . the boy had heard there is work there and thinks is it a good plan . the man looks underfed . with that decided the man gathers his marbles . the boy is loathe to surrender the cat  s eye , but the man is very insistent . it  s nothing a boy like you can afford he says not unkindly . he tucks the bag away and shakes the boy  s hand . his hand is warm and firm and he gives a boy a closed mouth smile . the boy watches the man stroll away , hand tucked in pocket and whistling . newline newline the boy walks back toward town . when he arrives he is not sure what happened but he is quickly distracted by the older boy and notquiteanman , who are both waiting for him . newlineit was a good plan . or at least , i thought it was . except for the execution . newline newline prince edward was a spoiled little shit . i knew that if the throne passed to him , he d either run the country into ruin , or one of my  trusted  advisers would be pulling his strings while lining their own pockets . either way , the people would suffer . and throughout my reign , i d always tried to do what was best for the people , and i wanted my heir to do the same . newline newline which is how i ended up here . in the dungeons . in my own castle . newline newline i think it was the disguise . it was nt very good . apparently beggars do nt actually wear roughspun sacks with holes cut out for the head and arms . or have horse dung smeared all over their face and body . or speak in a comprehensive manner . i was arrested on the first day for  behaving in a shifty manor  and  creating a public spectacle .  neither of which were really true , nor were they actually crimes . the magistrate knew that . he also recognized me . newline newline like i said , it was a good plan . except for the execution .a scream cuts through the air . newline newline  help us ultraman !  newline newline i wince , but keep running with the normal folk . perhaps after a few city blocks dissapear they ll all be more willing to accept my help . last week it was a giant lizard . the week before that , my archnemesis gorillatron . and every single time , after everyone is done crying , and everyone is safe , there s always those who say it s all ultraman s fault . he should pay for the damage .  well i tell you , i ve had enough . i m not going to be sued again , not going to pay another dime . i am putting the best decades of my life into this city , and they should remember it . newline newline  help us , help us !  comes another scream . newline newline well maybe i can save these people , but the next time ! ... or no , maybe a strongly worded letter . yes , that could do . newline newline i make my decision and duck into a dark alleyway . this is a job for ultraman !and he lay there . surrounded by those who loved him , fawning on him and giving him all he required and more than he desired . and yet he was the envy of no man . as he lay there , breathe provided by machine , food by a tube , and liquid by a needle , he screamed for death in thunderous silence as those he loved and loved him caressed him , read to him , prayed for him , lived for him . as he lay , dying and not dying , beyond pain but in agony . a silence beyond his own silence and beyond acknowledgement . silently , horribly , life is the death he never wanted . that he will always fear . that is his life .i m just going to wash my hair and get the fuck out of here before he even notices i m gone . okay body s all washed up , hair s all clean , i m good . i open the bathroom door and dammit he s awake staring at me .  leaving so soon , i thought last night was pretty fun ?  .  uhhh..yeah it was..but i really have to go..life , you know ?  i say with an awkward smile stretched across my face .  why do nt you take off that towel and we continue where we left off  he says with a smug look on his face . i m starting to feel like i m this guys first lay in months .  listen , last night was fun and the sex was great , but i do nt even remember your name  i say .  my name is eddie ... umm..what was yours again ?  he says .  joanne  i say with an annoyed look . newline newline i start to realize my clothing is missing , eddie is also naked lying in the bed .  eddie..can i have my clothes back ?  .  i guess i really ca nt convince you to stay can i ?  he says .  no  i m exasperated yet firm with my answer .  fine , their on the roof outside the window  he gets up to go to the window..  what the fuck ! ! oh my god  he screams . what the hell is going on i wonder . i walk up to him and look out of the window . i ca nt believe what i m looking at . this neighborhood is in shambles , scrapes of blood sprawl the streets . people are screaming and there are large flames a distance away . across the street a woman catches up to a man who was trying to flee , and she..she bites him , not just a small bite like a puppy would give , but a full on cannibalistic bite . i look at eddie  apocalypse ? !  i question .  i fucking think so..  he says back terrified . newline newline  is there any way you can go to the roof to get my clothes back , i d rather not face the apocalypse naked ?  i ask .  ok , ok. just let me get dressed first..  he gets a fresh set of clothing out of one of his drawers , get s dressed and opens the window to go to the roof to get mine .  be careful  i say . he gets my clothing no problem surprisingly .  you have your clothes , you can leave now  he mutters .  your fucking kidding me right , look outside people are fucking eating each other out there , i m staying  i scream .  i ca nt believe the only way i can get a woman to stay with me is for the fucking apocalypse to happen  he says sadly .  oh..um..listen i m sorry you have problems with women and everything but..  i m cut off by multiple loud thuds on the bedroom door , and what sounds like blood thirsty cries of rage .  run , get to the roof  eddie screams . newline newline we get to the roof , and shut the window as tight as we can . we both look through the window and see the bedroom where we had our late night drunken one night stand filled with walking corpses .  i feel like this is the universe telling me that sleeping with strange men is a bad idea  i say .  strange men ! you d probably be one of those things if i hadnt gotten you to this roof  he yells . he s right actually , poor guy i ve been bitching at him and he probably saved my life . there s no more time for arguments , we have to do something .  okay , well what do we do now . your house is crawling with those things along with the whole neighborhood and they could break through this window soon  i say .  we need to get to my car , we can drive somewhere safe , if somewhere safe exists..  he says .  and how do we get to your car ?  i ask .  we just need to climb down from this roof somehow and get to the garage and ... open the door  he explains . i m starting to wonder how were going to do this , seeing as walking corpses have littered this neighborhood . newline newline i look below us and there does nt actually seem to be that many of them in eddie s yard .  there s only a few of them down there , if we can somehow distract them we can get to the garage  i say .  how are we going to distract them ?  he asks .  i m not sure , do you have anything on you ?  i ask .  just my car keys , and we need those , do you have anything ?  . i check my pockets . a ticket from the club from last night , some mints , and a pair of fingernail clippers . i show eddie what i have .  i have an idea  i say .  what , clip them to death with those ?  he asks sarcastically .  no..give me your shirt !  i demand .  what the fuck are you going to do ? !  he asks .  i m going to cut myself open a bit and smear the blood on your shirt and throw it to distract those things , they ll smell the blood and think they have a meal  i explain . newline newline  jesus , that s a pretty good plan  he says with hope .  i know  i say surely .  let me be the one to do it though , no need for you to hurt yourself  he says . eddie is actually kind of sweet in his own way , i m starting to not mind spending the apocalypse with him . i give him the fingernail clippers , he cuts part of his hand with it , takes off his shirt and smears the blood on it . he manages to throw the bloody shirt into the street a good distance from his yard . we climb down from the roof onto his oil tank and then on to the ground .  okay , the garage is only a few steps away , but we should be really quiet  he whispers .  okay  i say . we sneak quietly to the garage , but the damn thing needs to be opened .  okay joanne , lets get this thing opened as fast as we can without making too much noise  . we both grab the bottom of the garage door and start to slowly pull up . it s about halfway opened when one of those things comes out of nowhere .  eddie , watch out ! ! !  i whisper scream . newline newline  do nt worry , just keep opening the door , i ll try and ward it off !  he says . i can hear punches behind me and splattering type noises , i hope he s okay . i get the garage door opened , look behind me and that thing is on the ground with it s face stomped in . eddie is standing there shirtless , with just jeans and sneakers full of blood .  fuck . did it bite you ?  i ask panicked .  no , this is just that thing s blood , lets get in the car !  he says . we get inside his car , which is at best a red box . not sure how far were going to get in this thing to be honest .  i know what you re thinking , but despite what betsy looks like she runs pretty good  he says .  you named your car ?  i ask laughing .  yeah  he smiles . we both laugh for a moment because it s nice to have a bit of lightness to another wise dark day .  thanks for saving my ass  i tell him .  thanks for picking me up at the club last night  he says jokingly . i look at eddie for a moment and decide to kiss him , because why not , the world s gone to hell anyways and he actually is a sweet guy . he kisses me back and then asks  so where do you want to go ?  .  wherever the apocalypse takes us  i say with a smile .060504 newline newline

was academically gifted in any particular field .  any game ?  the boy finally said . newline newline  yes any game of your choosing ,  the devil sighed . come on kid , hurry up , i ve got handicapped parking spaces to block and politicians to advise ,  he thought . newline newline  and are we playing for souls or is that too clich ?  newline newline  yes , we re playing for souls . you win , and you get the most powerful soul in the universe !  alright secondmost powerful ,  he added begrudgingly .  however , if i win , your soul is mine for all eternity , no heaven , no hell , just uninterrupted nothingness for all time .  newline newline the boy did nt seem fazed .  alright , i ve picked my game .  he spent some time rooting around in his backpack before finally producing a battered white deckbox . newline newline  let s play a little magic : the gathering .  newline newline  magic ? the hell is that ?  the devil inquired . he realized that he had lost his braggadocious composure , so he crossed his arms and attempted a confident smile . newline newline  magic is a strategic trading card game . you do nt seem to have a deck , so i suppose you can borrow mine . the format we are playing is called modern . we each star  newline newline  let s just start , i ll figure it out as we go .  newline newline thirty minutes later , the boy patted the devil on the shoulder . newline newline  it s ok , devil , you played well . it s hard to beat storm once it goes off .  newline newline the devil sat still at the obsidian table he had conjured for them to play on . newline newline  i lost .  newline newline  you did , now about my payment .  newline newline  no , you do nt understand , i do nt lose . i cant lose .  newline newline  apparently you can , and you did . fork over that soul , bud .  newline newline and with that , the devil gave the boy his soul . newlinealright , i guess i ll throw in my own ... newline newline       newline newline eli stood on the front patio of the restaurant , staring confoundedly at caroline  s retreating back as she stalked disgustedly away towards the parking lot . he had saved for two whole months to set aside enough money to pay for tonight  s dinner reservation . his planning had been meticulous to the point of obsession  everything had to be perfect . he had left nothing to chance , doublechecked the reservation daily , had even paid extra to ensure the table was stocked with flowers . alas , the waterfront table on the verandah would obviously not be seating any guests tonight . what had he done to set her off so badly ? he wondered in silent amazement . newline newline  excuse me sir ,  the maitre d  tapped him tentatively on the shoulder . eli turned to see him waiting with an apologetic look on his face  obviously he had witnessed the humiliating spectacle from the foyer .  i  m very sorry , sir , but if you don  t claim your reservation in the next five minutes , we  ll have to give up your table to another party , we  re overbooked tonight.  newline newline eli hurried after her into the parking lot ,  caroline , wait !  he said breathlessly ,  what  s wrong ?  newline newline she wheeled around , staring dangerously at him ,  you were with her again this afternoon.  she said with certainty . newline newline  who told you that ?  newline newline  what difference does that make ?  she demanded .  we agreed . no more seeing  friends  without letting each other know . especially her.  newline newline he rolled his eyes ,  we ve been over this . we ve known each other for years , there  s nothing else to it.  newline newline  if it  s harmless , then why did you keep it secret ?  she shot back , with a mixture of venom and heartbreak in her voice .  i thought i meant more to you than that.  newline newline this situation had gone horribly sideways . eli had spent literally months planning this night , had spent sleepless nights thinking about every minute detail , and wrestling endlessly with what he would say . after a full year of bliss with caroline , he wanted to make this night a special celebration . now though , things had gone almost comically off track . he chuckled almost in spite of himself at the hilarity of his predicament . this turned out to be a horrible mistake . newline newline  you know what ,  she said with disgust ,  forget it . i  m sure you ve got a million reasons why she  s so special and important and years of memories together and blah blah blah.  she stomped off again , this time with even more speed . newline newline  stop !  the word left his mouth so forcefully that it astonished even eli . he had always been a quiet man , never demanding or raising his voice , even in their worst arguments . it was one of the reasons she loved him so dearly . newline newline caroline turned back , equally stunned by the force of the command . newline newline  do you want to know what i said to her this afternoon ?  he approached her again , this time slowly , locking eyes as he mustered every ounce of courage within him .  i told her we would nt be hanging out any more like we used to . i told her that in spite of all the amazing times we ve had together over the years , the fact is i can  t be a friend to her anymore like i used to.  he hesitated  the last piece he had not at all intended to share in this moment . but what the hell , someone else was already sitting at their table , eating the dinner he had planned to have this conversation over . newline  because i  m getting married.  newline newline she stared quizzically at him for a moment . as the realization dawned , all the tension suddenly dissolved from her face and posture . he walked right up to her , fumbling in his pocket . he quickly produced the tiny jewelry box . newline newline she froze in excitement . she knew he had been secretly dying to talk to her about something for weeks . she had been hoping , even suspecting that this was coming , but still refused to give into the hope until she was sure . at this moment , caroline knew she was about to hear the words she  d been desperately waiting to hear since a month after they started dating newline newline newline newline newline the matre d  of the restaurant stood on the patio , hands shoved into his pockets as he looked on with satisfaction at the scene in the parking lot . he smiled in spite of himself as the young man took her hand and slid gracefully to a knee . a joyful shriek filled the parking lot . newline newline a waiter came out to investigate , looking first at the matre d  , then out to the parking lot . the matre d  chuckled ,  looks like the kid pulled out the win after all.  newlineit all began with a facebook message . newline newline i have always had a creative side . in the last year i had just finished writing , producing and directing my own movie . newline newline as i was working on my next script , i got a facebook message from a girl i used to go to high school with . her husband was a friend of mine and we also went to high school together . he had heard that i recently made a movie and suggested that she contact me because she was trying to expand her photography business to include personalized videos , as well . newline newline she started sending me long emails , explaining her thoughts and ideas . the project sounded like fun , so i offered to help her shoot the first session , so i could also teach her about videography . newline newline our emails about her business plan started becoming more personal , as we started sharing our lives . we were both married with two children , one boy and one girl . we ended up iming late into the night . both her husband and my wife would go to bed early . newline newline she had a crazy schedule because her daughter was autistic and wouldn  t go to sleep until 2 or 3 in the morning , and she since she worked best when it was quiet , she spent the hours of 3 to 6am editing photographs from her sessions . newline newline even though i had a regular 95 , i would stay up with her and chat . newline newline we found that we couldn  t stop writing each other . we just couldn  t get enough . newline newline soon , it was the day of our first combination session for one of our mutual friends . she told me the location and we met about an hour earlier so she could show me around . we hiked and talked for over an hour . newline newline we fell into silence when we came across this bench on a hill . we sat across from each other and looked into each others  eyes . we were in love . newline newline although we knew we couldn  t be together , because we were both married , we decided that we could work together . there was innocence in that right ? it gave us a legitimate excuse to be together because we could also generate much needed income in both of our houses . newline newline we started scheduling weekend sessions together , and found every excuse to spend time together . newline newline she had already scheduled a trip to arizona , and in the heat of the moment , i bought a plane ticket and went with her . we spent the whole weekend in the hotel room . newline newline we felt awful that we started this affair , but we were in love . on the plane ride home , we held hands and looked into each other  s eyes . it all felt so right . newline newline soon after that , i left my wife and filed for divorce . i could no longer be in a marriage that i felt this way for someone else . newline newline she didn  t consider leaving her husband until i left my wife . newline newline after i moved out of my house and settled into my new apartment , we had to see each other . she decided to spend one night with me , but one night became two , which ended up becoming a week . newline newline her husband was frantic with worry . she had to tell him where she was . newline newline when he found out about us . i thought it was over , but by some miracle it wasn  t . she told me that she was in love with me and while she loved her husband , she wasn  t in love with him the way she was with me . newline her husband moved out . newline newline during that time , she and i spent as much time as we could together and starting making plans . we talked about our wedding , and our future . we decided that she needed to officially end it with him so that we could be together the  right  way . newline newline everything was going as planned , until one day , i get a long email from her telling me that she changed her mind . when looking at the finances , i didn  t earn enough money to support two families and her photography business wasn  t enough to supplement what we needed to have a good life . newline newline i spent the next 4 months trying to change her mind . i was losing the love of my life over money ? that was her first excuse . then others came . her mother would not forgive her if she left her husband . she didn  t want to ruin the relationship between her husband and his children the way hers was ruined when her father left her mother . no matter what i did , no matter what i said , she refused to leave . by then he had moved back home . newline newline she told me that she was still in love with me and that she wanted to be with me , but god wanted her to be with her family . newline newline she saw me one last time . we stayed in the hotel room . we didn  t make love , but we held each other , foreheads touching , tears streaming down our faces as we looked in the others  eyes , telling each other how much we loved each other , knowing it was the last time we  d be together . newline newline we tried to stop emailing , but we couldn  t . we would im all day and video chat all night . newline newline i begged her to tell me she didn  t love me so that i could move on . she refused . with strained voices , and tears blurring our vision , we told each other every day how much we loved each other and wanted to be together . newline newline she would tell me about her day and when the kids were going to grandma  s . it killed me to know that she was with him even though she loved me . she was still his wife after all , and i knew that they would still behave as such . newline newline finally it got to be too much for me . i had to remove myself from her life because it was too painful to be a shadow and not be with her . to know that she was still with her husband , even though she was thinking of me . newline newline i told her that i would never love again and that i would wait for her until my dying day . that my love for her was bigger than me , and that words can  t describe how i felt . it would be like trying to describe a picasso with a calculator . she is everything to me . newline newline she promised she would find me if the situation was right , and our last words were  i love you so much.  newlinethe

worrying about a meltdown . newline newline newline she ll be mine , someday . in a metaphorical sense , i mean , not a literal one . the later is obviously the case already .it has been about 8 years since i have felt the best i have in a long time . yes the recession of 2008 was such a bad time for a lot of humanity , but it was a great time for me . see the worst the world is doing the better it is for me . as long as i keep the world in mayhem the longer i can survive . newline newline then this asshole named obama and some other world leaders came along and did a pretty good job of cleaning up that wreck and the world seems to be doing a lot better these days . i have been feeling pretty weak lately and i know i will not survive for much longer if the world continues on this current rate of progress . newline newline luckily i have one last trick up my sleeve , which may lead me to be the strongest i have been yet . that trick is a man called donald trump , and me being chairman of the republican national committee allows me to have a large influence on getting him elected . see without the republican party trump could never get elected , but i had some people talk to some people to talk to some people to ensure that he would be running on our ticket . i had to make sure no one knew i was backing him from the start , but i also had to ensure that he would win the primaries . with my position in the party this was fairly easy to do covertly . now with the election only a few days away i can already feel my power growing . newline newline the reason i want trump to win so bad is because it would be like letting a bull loose in a china shop . you have no idea what destruction and mayhem he will cause but you know he will and you know it will be a lot . i fear that if he does not win clinton will make the world far too stable and boring , and i will become to weak and my existent will come to an end . if trump does not win the election i will have to continue to get fox news to overhype all of the racial tensions , gun violence , immigration issues , and abortion that tend to cause mayhem in america in order to survive another four years for our next shot and what surely would be my last shot . newline newlinehey guys , this is my first time trying something like this and english is not my native tongue , so dont be too hard on me . but good

these guys are absolutely efficient . i did get quite irritated at their endless research and briefings on law enforcement and military assets in the area ... i mean i always focused on dealing with the local heroes union . but i had already signed the contract and could nt afford to rehire my henchmen . we started small ... ..a quick smash and grab on the jewelry store ? only when duke danger had captain quick tied up at city hall with yet another one of his famous  danger arrays  . a military convoy carrying chemical weapons ? ... ..no let mistress evil have that ... as soon as one of heroes union shows up we hit the credit union . and so we went on , no more monologues , no more high profile kidnappings , no more insane expenditures on death rays  that i have never actually seen fired , the y always seem to get smashed to bits  . without the color coordinated outfits , turns out they thought all the heists were just local criminals , plus the resistance was so light from law enforcement being tied up with the epic battles unfolding across the city . these guys are expensive , and i miss my monologues , but i like the positive numbers in my bank account . guess its time to throw that costume away .a red sun rose , like it always did , but the players did nt care . the end times were coming . the old albino said so , all the signs were there : the heroes walked through the village like zombies , the creator seemed more distant than ever , the only time the players spoke was when the rattles of fate were also audible , usually when the village was in danger , and even then their disinterest was evident in their utterances of huh ?  and i check for traps , or whatever . : newline newline  nbsp  newline newline really , the only one who did nt seem nervous was the merchant with his sixlegged purple cow . when dave , the halfling farmer , asked him why , he just smiled . the creator had nt blessed dave with ranks in diplomacy , nor was his wisdom high enough to grant a bonus , not even if he hit middle age . still , he had to know . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline  huh . nat 20 .  the voice of the creator said . the heroes perked up , the players took note . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline  wait , why are you even rolling for two npc s ? this is why i should be gm !  a player cried , his voice that of his hero . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline  oh , so now you re paying attention ?  the creator sighed , her voice tired . dave knew she tried . being the creator must be tough . he prayed to her , and for her , but it clearly was nt enough .  just go back to your phone .  newline newline  nbsp  newline newline dave did his best to ignore the voices , instead focusing on his conversation with the merchant . what else could he do ?  so why , if the end times are really coming , are nt you afraid ?  newline newline  nbsp  newline newline  because ,  the merchant replied slyly ,  i m something a little more than just la sidequest npc ,  he explained . dave s eyes widened . sidequests were really the only reason he and his family existed ! that , and greatgrandma was a wererat , but the family did nt hold that against her . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline  what is it ? can i save my family ?  the halfling asked , his voice pleading . the merchant looked him over thoughtfully . he kept packing up his wares , this was looking to be this world s last session . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline  you know , i think your grandmother already is one , i feel like i ve met her before ,  he explained ,  but i

legged purple cow . i ve seen a dozen worlds , and i ll see a dozen more before the players get tired of me . you want to be a reoccurring npc , here s what you have to do ... it was a particularly frigid winter afternoon . i was just leaving the train station and started walking in the direction of home when i noticed a homeless man huddled under a streetlamp near the taxi rank . he only had a thin shirt on , tattered black jeans and no shoes or jacket . the poor man was going to freeze in this weather . as i approached him i dug my hand into my pocket to search for some spare change . i did nt have any coins , but i did have an unopened chocolate piece that was still in its foil and had nt melted yet . as aesop once said , no act of kindness , no matter how small , is ever wasted . so i took the small piece of chocolate and dropped it into the man s felt hat that was sitting on the sidewalk in front of his legs . newline newline  what the fuck is this ! ?  he howled . he turned the hat over so that the chocolate fell into his open palm .  what the fuck is this ? i want money goddamit !  he spat on my shoes and i ran off . newline newline yeah , fuck you aesop . seriously . you paint the world with seven colours , they think it represents gays . how do i deal with this ?  newline newline  you think you  ve got it bad ?  another god exclaimed , as the god of rainbows turned to look at the god of unicorns . the god of unicorns was lovingly petting one of his creatures as he sniffed .  not only do they think that my babies are gay , but they also think they don  t exist ! what do i have to do to prove them wrong ?  newline newline as the god of unicorns nuzzled his face against the majestic onehorned horse , his body began to shake as he sobbed . the god of rainbows could only watch him awkwardly , as he inched closer to his friend and patted him on the back . newline newline  there , there . it  s going to be okay . someday the humans will understand and learn to love rainbows and unicorns.  newline newline  rreally ?  newline  really ?  newline newline as the god of unicorns lifted up his head , he blinked cutely at his friend before sending him a smile .  thanks , man . i love you.  newline newline the god of rainbows quickly retracted his hand and put it away .  dude , no homo . my rainbows are for everyone  sorry.  newline newline and that

following you anymore than it already does .  newline newline  too bad .  was her response .  if i do nt complete this assignment it ll reflect worse on me . was i ashamed of my family history ? worse yet , am i hiding some dirty secret like a classic dirty cop ? if there s fallout , i ll deal with it .  newline newline i sat and reflected for a few moments before finally agreeing . folding my newspaper neatly i said  alright . grab your coat i usually leave in 10 minutes .  newline newline twenty minutes later we were outside my business . the rooster and the rose  intimate encounters . i had been one of the first legal brothels in canada . when i opened my doors i promised to end the image of a purple suited pimp treating women like objects . first and foremost the  menu  was equal numbers male and female , with a few employees that swung both ways . newline newline secondly , my employees were paid an hourly wage , and made about 50k a year depending on events and overtime . activities were recorded and then as a farewell the employees and clients could choose to save or delete the footage . a professional quality film edit ran  899.99 , so most clients chose to delete . newline newline finally , unlike most bosses where i would create a schedule and that authority has to be followed , i offer shifts and people sign up for them through the week . clients call ahead and book an appointment in a specific theme room or with a specific employee , and it was the employees choice to accept or not apply . newline newline as i turned the key and killed the engine , liz looked over and whipped a paper package out of thin air it seemed .  so dad . what made you want to start this business ?  newline newline  in the beginning i was an idealistic young man that thought i could make the new laws on brothels swing to my favor . i opened my doors with the intent to make boatloads of money surrounded by sex and attractive men and women . i did nt think much about a family or a future , i just wanted to be successful .  newline newline  then what happened ?  newline newline  then i met your mother . come on , let s go inside .  newline newline as we walked through the doors the lingering smell of sex assailed us . the front room looked much like a classic strip club . brass pole on polished hardwood stage off to the right , bar to the left , and a red velvet curtain to the back rooms . the room was empty except for jerry , the bouncer and sometimes performer , and leon , his boyfriendmy bartender . leon immediately noticed liz . newline newline  hey boss ! new employee for orientation ?  he called over and i blanched . liz however rolled with it , strutting right up to leon in her five foot five of red headed fury .  that depends what orientation you prefer , bent over or bound up .  jerry burst into tears laughing and leon stood there awe struck , then blinked and said  you have to be sandras daughter ! i am so so sorry !  then he looked at me realizing what he just said to his bosses daughter .  oops .  newline newline i waved it off and asked  anybody got an early booking they re waiting for ? anybody in the back ?  newline newline jerry answered ,  yeah nicole s waiting for a client in the dungeon , and cain in the jungle room .  newline newline  perfect !  i chirped and turned to lead liz past the velvet curtain . as we walked passed and entered the back hall , black polished doors lined the walls , and liz piped up . newline newline  what was mom like back then ?  newline newline i stopped in my tracks .  your mother was the most beautiful , vibrant , energetic person to ever work here . she took this place as her own . as her home . everyone here mattered to her . she opened my eyes to the connection that intimacy can bring . in a way she taught me how to love . i miss her every day .  newline newline  i know dad . that s why i joined the police academy , to stop other people from losing their mom like we did . a stupid car crash . from a stupid driver blowing through a stop sign at 80 .  she looked upset and i was already . then her eyes hardened and she set her jaw . just like her mother . newline newline  so why did leon call one room the dungeon ?  liz asked as we stayed walking again .  you ll see .  newline newline as i opened the door a surprised  fuck  and the scramble for clothing was all i heard . i waited until nicole came to the door , clutching the edges of a robe looking embarrassed .  oh hey boss !  she said as she opened the door wide , and liz  eyes opened wider . in the center of the room was a massive king size wrought iron bed , with shackle points every six inches on the bars as well as the head and foot boards . a catherine s wheel and spanish donkey were pushed to the right while a set of classic stocks was bolted to the floor behind them . to the right of the bed was an empty space with a soft mat on it , and suspension points above . to complete the motif a massive weapons rack of paddles , whips , crops , and restraints all hung neatly organized . newline newline nicole noticed liz  expression and chuckled .  liking what you see doll ?  liz shook her head as if to clear it , and began to interview nicole . newline newline what do you enjoy about working here ? newline the freedom to set my schedule , to explore myself , and to experience new activities and lovers . newline newline what made you decide to pursue this career ? newline honestly i did nt . i put in a resume as a joke and 8 got a phone call . never thought i d make a career of it . newline newline this continued for a few minutes before liz piped up to me and said   ok no more questions here , where to next ?  newline newline  cain , in the jungle room , probably wearing a loincloth  i responded , leading the way . newline newline i lead her to the jungle room , and before i could knock the door swung open as cain came rushing out . newline newline  snake !  he cried as he tore passed , and sure enough someone had put a garter snake in the jungle room as a prank . liz started laughing as she watched cain prance down the hall , butt cheeks flapping in the breeze wailing about such a little snake . newline newline instead of interviewing cain i ended up giving liz a tour of the theme rooms we offered , and answered a few general queries she had . then as we were going to leave she stopped me .  dad . i might take no for an answer here , i m not sure , but are you hiring ? it took me a good minute to compose myself . i secretly thanked my parents for blessing me with an impassive face . i knew i didn  t look afraid . newline newline i understood now , clearly , that i was facetoface with death . the first thing i noticed was the voice . death  s voice was highpitched . it was not a deep baritone . i blurted out the first thing that came to my mind  newline newline  you  re a woman ?  newline newline  why , yes.  she said softly . she didn  t bother to say more . newline newline i sneezed thrice . i didn  t bother to cover my mouth . newline newline  i  m sorry.  i said before realising that the probability of death catching a cold was kinda slim . newline newline i took the handkerchief by my pillow side and blew my nose . then i looked up to see that death had gotten back to her book . it was so rare to meet an earnest reader and ideally i wasn  t one to disturb , but i took exception then , because i was in the mood to talk . newline newline  what are you reading ?  i asked in mock enthusiasm . newline newline she didn  t respond immediately . she turned a page and lingered on it for a few seconds , before she closed the book and looked up . newline newline  a song of ice and fire by george r r martin.  she said . newline newline  oh , game of thrones . valar morghulis !  newline newline  huh ?  newline newline  valar morghulis ? all men must die ?  newline newline  nope . i haven  t gotten there yet.  she said . it sounded as if this irritated her slightly . like a mosquito buzzing near her ear . newline newline  oh dude !  i exclaimed .  you  re going to have one helluva ride . where have you reached ?  newline newline she considered me for a second , as if making up her mind whether i was worth a conversation or if she should just rip out my soul and take the next train out . newline newline  jon snow has left for the wall . neddard and his daughters have left for king  s landing.  she said finally . newline newline  any direwolves dead yet ?  newline newline  what ? no !  newline newline  oops ! sorry.  i said hastily . newline newline  don  t tell me anything more . i  m don  t appreciate spoilers.  newline newline  sure . i  m sorry.  newline newline i blew my nose loudly . it reminded me of my mortality . newline newline  so ,  i said , wishing to change the topic .  i usually don  t mind a girl in my room , but i must ask . why are you here ?  newline newline  you  re mostly going.  she snapped . newline newline  going where ?  i asked . newline newline  with me.  newline newline  where ?  newline newline  out of here.  newline newline  and you ?  newline newline  me ?  newline newline  yeah you.  newline newline  me what ?  newline newline  where are you going ?  newline newline  i  ll go on.  newline newline  go on ?  newline newline  yeah , go on.  newline newline a pause . newline newline  that  s really deep.  newline newline  it  s not . it  s purely business.  she said . newline newline i dunno if i had imagined it , but i think i saw the slightest hint of disapproval in her tone . i decided to pursue it . newline newline  you don  t like it ?  i asked tentatively . newline newline  it s work.  she said shortly . newline newline  yeah , but you needn  t do it if you don  t want to.  i said . newline newline  excuse me ? have you seen anyone else sauntering around in all blacks calling themselves death ?  newline newline if this was a short story , i  d have laughed . but i said instead  newline newline  no . no , i haven  t.  newline newline  there you go.  she said , as if that explained everything .  so i have to do it.  newline newline i didn  t want to probe her further . so death didn  t like her job . big deal . nine out of ten people everywhere hated their jobs . death was one of them . except death wasn  t people . newline newline  i know what it  s like.  i said , with an understanding nod .  i  m a standup comic but all i  ve ever wanted to be was serious once in a while.  newline newline she ignored this . newline newline  i just feel i just feel i could have been doing something else , if if only i wasn  t death , you know.  she , looking down at the floor . newline newline  really ? like what ?  newline newline  i don  t know . anything , i guess.  she pointed at me .  standup comedy , maybe ?  she pointed at a framed poster of lenny bruce on my wall .  an interior decorator ?  she held up her book .  maybe a literary critic.  newline newline  you  d make a lousy critic.  i said . newline newline  why do you think so ?  she asked curtly . newline newline  because you  re too passionate about what you  re reading . there  s no critical analysis . you  ll just love a book or hate it.  newline newline  that  s not true.  she said . i sensed her tone to be halfhearted . newline newline  well , then let me tell you what happens to jon in the fifth book.  newline newline  no.  she shouted . newline newline  see , towards the end of book five , jon and his mates  newline newline  stop.  newline newline she had gotten up . her eyes were wide in anger . the book in her left hand . her index finger in it , acting as bookmark . newline newline  if you say one more word , you  ll have to go.  newline newline i laughed . newline newline  i think you said i can take my time . and besides   i thought i  ll take in the expression on her face before i said it .  you can  t make me go before my time . it  s why you brought your game of thrones here in the first place.  newline newline i saw her open her mouth ever so slightly before closing it . she let out a heavy sigh . newline newline  don  t worry . i won  t spoil it for you.  newline newline i blew my nose . she let a moment pass before proceeding to sit down again . i knew i had to take my chance when it was available . newline newline  but  i said firmly . she looked up . newline newline  if it  s the last thing i do , i  ll spoil game of thrones for you before i go.  i said . newline newline  no , you won  t.  newline newline  oh i will.  i said triumphantly .  if i  m going out , you  re going with me , sister.  newline newline she stood up abruptly and walked over to the side of my bed . i remained where i was , mortified . i had done it . i had ticked off the one person who held my life by it  s balls . why ? i thought frantically . why did i have to play this card now ? i stopped thinking . she was speaking again . newline newline  let  s just say ,  she said .  no one  s going out today . i  ll keep my game of thrones and you can keep your life . can we shake on that ?  newline newline i saw a pale white hand protrude out of her robe . it looked soft . for one mad moment , i felt we used the same moisturiser , but i realised this wasn  t the moment to ask . newline newline  yes.  i said grasping her hand .  we can shake on that.  newline newline i let go of her hand as soon as possible .  i don  t want you to catch a cold ,  i said sheepishly . newline newline there was no acknowledgement from her end . just at that moment , i sneezed thrice , blew my nose and looked up . she wasn  t there . newline newline edit : grammari take a sip from my trusty vault canteen . my supply was getting dangerously low , i needed to find water . trouble is , it s hard to find water that is nt irradiated or claimed . this canteen was given to me when i was 13 , and thrown out of my vault into the wastes . when they said the wastes were wastelands they were understating it . it s surprising how much nothingness there is out here . the sun beats down on my body in the day and the nights chill me to the bone . i come across other people every now and again , or signs of others , but always stayed away unless i needed to . i realise most people were like me trying to eke out a living but you could nt trust someone to not stab you in the back when you are asleep . i met this one guy who swore he was ambushed by this girl looking for special bottle caps . crazy . newline newline i pulled out my map , no pipboy for me  they did nt have my size . and laid it on a rusted truck s bonnet . i looked at the dated map with names of places that did nt exist anymore . washington dc , that was a hive of mutants , raiders and death traps . i had been in there once , barely twenty five feet into the ruins before a automated turret started firing at me . i ran to cover , the bullets pinged off the floor and kicked up a cloud of dust . i inhaled the cloud accidentally , heaving from the sudden burst of movement . coughing it from my lungs i picked up a rock and threw it to my left . the stone was pummeled into pieces by the turret s gunfire . i decided it was best to stay put , for a while at least . it took three days for that turret to run out of ammo , three days of random objects , people , things being shot at until finally it went click . i decided enough was enough and scavenged it . now i had my own personal turret , which was good . shame i did nt have any ammo for it . newline newline i shook myself from the fog of memories and brought myself back to the map . as far as i could tell , i was heading towards vault 74 . i had heard of it off of a few merchants and even a raider ! old world tech was being developed there by immortal scientists , something important . i had sold what i did nt need and stocked up on food as much as possible before setting out . it was on the opposite side of the wasteland , a four day walk . even a walk that lasted half a day could be dangerous  anyone , anything could kill you off . the first day i came across a shack overseeing a quarry , with two bugs in a cage . i slept on the mattress which was a luxury compared to the floor . a roof over my head , a mattress as a bed , this was the life . i was halftempted to stay there and forget about 74 entirely , but something told me it was nt safe . newline newline on the second day i did not get that lucky . i spent most of the day hiding in a sewer tunnel from a band of slavers . they had two slaves with them , a man and woman . the man tried to overpower one of the smaller ones and take his gun . instead he was punched in the face and a collar on his neck detonated and left him , headless . i kind of like my head , not that it s the best head in the world but it s a damn sight better than one that is pulp . newline newline the third day , the third day was weird . i came across this small town  dale i think it was . everyone seemed nice but there was something off about them , like they were hiding something from me . i did nt stay the night there or have any of their food  i left at midnight . when i reached the hill crest i turned around to get one last look at the town and saw three torches heading towards the home they set up for me . i got out there before they came looking . newline newline today is the fourth day . i think i m close , the map shows me that a company base is near here . valve ... i would have thought they were a part company , not program development . before i was jettisoned from my vault i learned about prewar companies  valve was to do with radiation if i recall right . i move my tanned finger over the crinkled map . i have five miles to go in a northeast direction , i think , before i get there . as for getting into the vault.. i ll solve that when i get to it . the hairs on the back of my neck stand up . i think someone is behind me . i grab the pistol from beneath my cloak , hopefully who ever is behind me does nt see my hand moving , and take it out of the holster . thank god i loaded it this morning . i spin around suddenly my arm raised at the person . newline newline it s a tumbleweed . i chuckle at myself awkwardly . if i start jumping at plants then i ll never survive . i turn back around and holster my gun . i wipe my brow , my hand shaking . this is embarrassing . i hear a snap before a blunt object swings into vision . newline newline   newline newline i wake up in a gurney . leather restraints hold me down , and i ca nt get out of them . i jerk around on the gurney , too hard apparently as i fall on the side . great , now i ca nt even move or see past this immaculate floor . the door opens , and a shadow blocks the door . newline newline hello . we ve been expecting you . this is vault 74 , otherwise known as valvetec .  the voice said , it sounded like a mans . newline newline what ? let me out of this thing now !  i do nt care about the tech now , i want to be able to go back to my shack . newline newline i m sorry mr ... gordon . we ca nt do that . we need you .  newline newline how do you know my name ? need me for what ? !  newline newline we looked at your.. files . we need you for testing a project we have just finished .  the voice sounded odd at the word  files  as if it was new to it . it s monotone voice was distorted slightly . newline newline what project ?  i questioned . being a science experiment was nt my idea of fun . newline newline we call it hl3 . otherwise known as half life 3 . confirmed  the voice paused as if expecting something . newline newline so.. ? there s not a lot of people out there anymore .  why does it want me to care ? should i know ? newline newline really ? our memory banks , that is to say memory is faulty . thank you for the information mr gordon . i hope you enjoy your testing .  the voice started to close the wooden door . actual wood , that was rare . newline newline wait what ? at least let me up ? please ! let me go ! let me go !  i shook side to side again , but stayed stuck on the ground . a sharp prick comes from my thigh and i start to feel drowsy . my vision goes black before i slip into darkness ...i just do nt get how they have nt figured out better service by now . i mean , not a single bar ? we ve got doubleagents in afghani caves who get better coverage than this . newline newline did i hookup with katrina at billy s party ? fuck , i think i tried . i probably dropped that stupid line about if we should be kissing or some shit . man that was a wild one . newline newline alright , so the cops came , we sprinted , and kirsh fell over that creek . and i remember zack getting tackled . and i left my shoes in the front room . god . dammit . newline newline well , i did nt lose my wallet . there s some cash here , so at least i can get a cab , or pay someone to drive me home . newline newline oh shit ! that guy picked me up after the party . man , what was his name ? he kept telling me to get in his devonian , or was it a delorean ? ... what an awesome car . newline newline i wonder where i told him to drop me off ? newline newline newline newlinepicture , if you will , an orange dusk swallowing the docks of a city somewhere in middle america . the city , more a town really , is just now beginning to grow fat with the burgeoning golden age of postwwii usa . the town hums with activity and even as the hour turns late and proper men and women return to their homes there is a sense of purpose about the town . trade flows in on the river , and all around there is an almost oppressive sense of purpose  each and every person striving and thriving together in the dawn of the nuclear age . newline newline but try to picture such a town , on a thursday , as the sun is beginning to set and the great wheels of industry grind to a halt . some few unlucky souls still toil away on the dock , but beyond that the activity in town is the activity of hooligans and teeny boppers . some of the younger ones begin walking home as they notice the setting sun , but others still linger as dusk becomes night . newline newline among these adolescents and malcontents there is no shortage of energy or angst . they seem to come alive with the night , and in the glow of the neon signs dusk stretches on into the night . it is in that electric dusk of old america that these would be rebels veterans of the war and future protesters of the ones that follow dance and sing and scream to the world  i am still alive !   . newline newline some shout louder than others , yet there are some which shout nothing at all . they cling to the sides of the dance halls , they nurse their beers and simply smile sadly at their friends as they twirl in the night . some of them stare longingly at what they wish they had , some simply know that they whatever it is they want it is not this , and others look at those twirling drunkards and stew in the darkness of the corners . newline newline such is the way of life . in victory and good fortune we fritter away what we have , and spend our brief years of respite celebrating instead of preparing , drunk on the virtuous liquor of peace . such is the attitude of this town . they drink in their prosperity , absorbed so completely by the ambrosia of success that they are blind to their own aches and pains . if they feel sick when they re done drinking then just always
