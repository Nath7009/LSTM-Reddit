 you show them what its like to be you sleeping below .  newline newline  previously written , with a few edits i attempted to make it fit your wp newlinerunning out into the desolate square , elsa could see the horse drawn carriage in the distance . she started to make a break for it , only to stop short and see anna step out from behind a house some 15 feet away . newline newline  do nt do this elsa , please . you need to come with me , your powers can hurt people . we just need you to learn to control it . you need to learn your limitations .  newline newline  anna , that s just not the way i see it . that awful treaty is going to give people free reign to use me as weapon . to use us as a weapon .  newline newline  elsa ... i did nt want it to come to this . on the roof !  mulan , flipping off the roof threw bolas on elsa s hands . landing on a small stack of hay next to anna , mulan sat perched waiting for further orders .  anna , please . do nt do this .  newline newline  elsa , you know we do nt have a choice .  anna said .  that s where we see it different , we always have choice .  elsa said coolly . anna was now joined by jasmine , belle , cinderella , and aurora . out of the shadows a small bird came and landed on elsa s wrists , making short work of the bolas rope . snow white stepped beside her followed by rapunzel , merida , ariel , and tianna . newline newline  of course , i did nt think you d be alone . well , it looks like were gon na settle this the old fashioned way huh ?  anna exclaimed . newline newline  you know this is nt what i wanted . anna why ca nt you just let us go ?  elsa begged .  you know i ca nt do that ...  anna began advancing , followed by her troupe . elsa started running as well , tears in her eyes . the two girls met in the middle , belting out immense ballads , with beautiful pitch and tone . all around them a cacophony of sound was echoing around the town . the princesses whilst singing beautiful were using their abilities and fighting skill to try and best the other . newline newline ariel engaged aurora with a heartfelt soliloquy about her undying love for eric , all the while jabbing with her father s pitchfork . cinderella was slapping merida s bushy red curls up and down , breaking a glass slipper over her head as she sung of independence for herself . rapunzel had belle in a choke hold with her long , magical hair . belle attempting to squeak out the high notes about loving what s inside of you . snow white , tianna , jasmine , and mulan were caught in a rough and tumble throwing wild fists and defending from the onslaught of animals that seemingly came out of nowhere . newline newline back at the centre a small ice storm raged on , neither anna nor elsa backing down . anna grab her sister by the shoulders attempting to push her over . elsa managed to slap anna and freeze her hands to a nearby post . elsa woefully cried ,  i m sorry anna ! i ... i ca nt  elsa raised her hands creating a thick blizzard , obscuring everyones vision . elsa slowly felt her way to the carriage , looking back as she grabbed the reigns to her defeated sister frozen to the pole . cracking the reigns , she waited a safe distance to dispel the blizzard . knowing in her heart that her friends and beloved sister would be ok. newline newline little did elsa realize , pocahontas was tracking her . newline newline                                                                newline newline well it s getting late that s all for now . i ll try my best to continue . other stories over at rtheyogibearhawrites if you like how i writeso , there s been this bug going around for a few years and most people ca nt shake it . i never got it . it was a real slow progression , at first there were runny noses , then the coughing , they complained about feeling terrible , people took sick leave , then i assumed they just learned to live with it over the last few years . i kind of work by myself and play online games when i get home . how was i supposed to know they were dead , i m not a doctor . it s not like cindy from accounts runs up to you and says ,  oh , by the way i died on thursday , can you get me the tps reports early this week ?  no , she drops the manilla folders in the slots like always and avoids talking to me like she has since that awkward kiss i slobbered on her at the christmas party . i was drunk , sue me . newline newline so , my friends in the game had no idea i did nt know . it s the end of the world and it is full of zombies  but nobody seems to care . it s not like the movies at all , they do nt chase you around ...he fell as fast as the gunshot that killed him . the  supreme leader  was no more . thousands of gasps filled the air , and i stood up to the podium to address what i assumed would be an overjoyed crowd . newline newline  what have you done ! ?  a woman shouted , tears streaming down her face .  why would you do this ? i loved him .  still in the mindset that everyone was conditioned to love their immortal deity of a leader , i tried convincing the woman that she no longer had to fear .  it s okay , you re safe now . all of you are safe , all of you are free !  i stared into the crowd , and received a thousand stares in return . some looked heartbroken , some enraged , others in shock , unable to comprehend why their benevolent and kindly leader had been assassinated . newline newline the silence had almost become to much to bear . i was expecting applause , instead i was left with the feeling i just ruined the lives of millions . suddenly , one of my former revolutionaries stepped up to the podium . i heard the screams of true fear . dread of what is to come . it ended almost as quickly as it began though , the crowd unexpectedly surrounded by the armed hordes of prisoners i d freed . newline newline  you can all thank this hero right here for busting me out .  he burst into a hoarse laugh .  that was a nice hero of the people performance you put on pal . nearly believed it myself !  i did nt understand . that s what hurt the most , not the fact that i just endangered the lives of so many , but that i did nt even know why . i had to know . i could live with myself if i just knew what i did wrong .  please , tell me what s going on . why are you doing this ?  the man seemed genuinely confused .  kid , you broke out the entire prison , what did you think was gon na happen ?  newline newline  wait , i only did that because i thought i was freeing innocent civilians who were unfairly charged !  everyone s expression changed . the once despairing audience had a look of pure incomprehension . one member of the crowd shouted  what the hell is wrong with you ? ever since our glorious leader perfected the criminal justice system , only the guilty have been imprisoned , and only the worst of the worst . everyone else is rehabilitated !  newline newline  wait  i stammered ,  are you telling me you were okay with the constant surveillance , heavily armed drones , and mandatory injections with ambiguous purpose ?  several cries were heard from the audience , ranging from  the cameras are for pure security . no one even watches the recordings anymore !  to  the drones only fire nonlethal anesthetics !  and  the injections have eliminated all the previously common and harmful diseases !  newline newline this was when i realized that freeing dangerous criminals , and then disabling a nation s security and health systems is nt the best idea .waiting was the hardest part . finally someone stepped into the room , and tallulah stood . it was going to happen . she would never have to think about him again . he  d be gone from her life for good .  i  m sorry.  that wasn  t what she was expecting .  according to our records you  ve already had a memory removed.  newline newline she shook her head .  i don  t remember it happening.  newline newline  that  s a part of the service . we took that from you , so you wouldn  t know something was gone , but this is something that can happen.  newline newline  i  she nibbled her bottom lip , trying to find the words she needed , even though all she wanted to do was cry .  can you tell me anything about when my memory was removed ?  newline newline  no , i can  t , because you signed a form to protect yourself from ever finding out the truth . we have had people come in here before asking whether they  ve had memories removed . in your situation it  s different , so we can offer you counselling to deal with this , if you feel that  s what you need.  newline newline  right now i don  t know what i want.  she did , but it was never going to happen .  is that a decision i need to make now ?  newline newline  you can take as much time as you need . we know who you are , so if you come in to ask for counselling it will be sorted out straight away.  newline newline  okay.  tallulah nibbled her lip again .  i take it i should leave.  newline newline  do what you feel is right . we aren  t going to force you to leave . you can stay here for as long as you like , or you can leave if that  s what you think would be for the best.  newline newline as she blinked the tears away she sank onto the seat she  d been sitting on before she learnt the truth .  thank you.  newline newline  would you like someone to sit with you ?  newline newline  no , thank you.  newline newline  there  s a button on the arm of the chair . press it if you need anything at all . food , drink , someone to talk to  newline newline  i will.  she wouldn  t , but he didn  t need to know that .  thank you.  newline newline  you  re welcome.  newline newline he left the room and she couldn  t help breathing a sigh of relief . with him gone she could let herself cry . tears slowly trickled down tallulah  s cheeks . she was going to have to live with the memory of finding the man she believed she was going to marry with her best friend . breathing deeply , doing her best to calm down , she brushed the tears off her cheeks , focusing on what her next step was going to be . a sound made her turn towards the door and she saw someone pushing a piece of paper underneath it . for a long time she stared at it , before going over to pick it up . newline newline  i can tell you what memory was taken .   when she opened the door there was no one there .  meet me in the park opposite here within the next hour if you want to know what it was . if you don  t come you won  t be able to out the truth .   grandpa come on ! we re gon na be late !  newline newline  alrighty , hold your horses . i ai nt the nimble young lad i used to be .  newline newline kyle forrester had promised to take his grandkids austin and gary on a trip during their summer break , however he was surprised to hear that of all the amusement parks and places they could go they decided on a local paintball center . thus the eighty five year old veteran found himself observing from the sidelines , as his grandchildren played on a pretend battlefield , mirroring the ones he marched on all those decades ago . newline newline as the paint splashed against obstacles and players alike , kyle thought back to his youth , and how much of it was lost in those wastelands . nobody besides his closest friends can family could have known that around seventy years ago , the amicable old man down the street who made the best cookies in all of charleston was private kyle forrester of the 19th infantry regiment . as a part of the american 24th infantry division , kyle and his unit was one of the few which had participated in nearly the entirety of the korean war . newline newline painful memories crept their way out of the crevices in his mind that held them , but he pushed them aside as well as the tears that welled up in his eyes . newline newline for every friend that was lost countless more were saved . for every drop of blood shed a day of happiness was secured for my family . come on , get it together . do nt let the kids see you like this .  newline newline kyle looked up and saw austin and gary crouched behind a wooden wall , peeking over now and then to fire at the other team . newline newline  cover that flimsy would get shredded by any heavy weapons .  kyle muttered under his breath . newline newline  i agree , a thirty caliber browning would make swiss cheese of that no ?  newline newline kyle looked up to see another man observing the game next to him . newline newline  i m sorry , and you are ?  newline newline  oh where are my manners . i am longdao liu , but you can call me larry .  newline newline  kyle forrester . so what do you know about thirty cals ?  newline newline  oh plenty i would hope , considering i ve been shot at by them more often than i can count .  newline newline kyle felt apprehension slowly taking hold as he took in the meaning behind that answer . newline newline  you were in the army ?  newline newline  i was in an army yes . and judging by your comment earlier you were as well .  newline newline  twenty fourth infantry , 1949 to 1953  newline newline  oh what a coincidence , i too served in korea .  newline newline  really now  newline newline  yes , 112th mechanized infantry .  newline newline  pva  newline newline  correct .  newline newline  gave us a hell of a time at han river .  newline newline  the whole war was hell .  newline newline  got that right . your artillery caused us several sleepless nights .  newline newline  yours as well . artillery does nt really do much when your sector is attacked by planes then swarmed with an enemy force several times larger .  newline newline  were you by any chance on our right flank during the attack ?  newline newline  i was . there were four of us in that trench , and i was the only one to survive the bombing to be captured .  newline newline  i remember now ! baker company reported only one enemy taken prisoner when they overran the first defense line . i marched past with the rest of my platoon where you were kept guarded . hell we mighta even made eye contact .  newline newline  is nt that a turn of fate then , two enemies from the battlefield now watching their descendants play war for amusement .  newline newline  kinda when you put it like that . so how d you end up in charleston ?  newline newline  well when i was repatriated after the war life was very different . neighbors gossiped about me being taken captive , saying that i shirked my duty . i could nt bear that environment so i moved . i travelled for many years , before ending up in the very country i took up arms against . i learned english , found a job , got married , and the rest is history .  newline newline  sounds like hell of a ride .  newline newline  indeed it was . are you here with family ?  newline newline  my grandkids  newline newline  ah , me as well . younger generations , they do nt really understand do they ?  newline newline  how could they ?  newline newline  newline newline not long after kyle said his farewells , austin and gary returned . they were covered in bits of paint but looked extremely pleased with themselves . newline newline  we sure showed them did nt we ?  newline newline  yep ! they ll think twice before messing with us again .  newline newline kyle looked the two up and down and could nt help but laugh at how silly they looked . newline newline  well did you now ? well what do you two think about grabbing some ice cream ? you know , to celebrate your grand victory .  newline newline  yeah !  newlineacross the smoking ruins , and past the creek stained black with oil and blood , captain nathan deshler looked over the battlefield . newline newline his face was a mask of soot and grime , his arms covered with dirt and numerous cuts . his coolant vest was unzipped , the hot summer breeze doing little to wick away the sweat which clung to his skin . the dogend of a cigarette was clenched in his teeth , the cheap tobacco adding to the stench of burnt meat and ozone . newline newline  hot work , nate ,  lieutenant yulia akulova said , waving her hand through the billowing smoke .  finally found that lost pack ?  newline newline deshler nodded , his distant stare unfocused .  that last neanderthal jarred it loose . figured i d take it as a sign .  he flicked a bit of ash off the tip .  do nt worry  this line of work will kill me way before any cancer .  the humor was lost in the humid breeze . newline newline  so who won , nate ? us ?  newline newline deshler shook his head , flicking the smoldering butt away before turning to face his xo . newline newline  nah . not us , but not them either . our employers , they re the only ones who came out on top . not us , them . once again , we re the ones who ve lost .  have i ever told you the definition of insanity ?  newline newline  do nt you start with that cliche nonsense .  the interrogator smiled . he had heard it before . newline newline  torturing a man with cancer . what can you do that this disease has not already done ? i am agonized beyond what you can do .  the captor coughed , a red mist spraying out his mouth every time he spoke . newline newline  what are your plans , carker ? is it a bomb ? where is it ? why kill so many when you re already going to die ?  the interrogator continued to attempt to make a man who already felt constant pain feel worse . it was ineffective at best . newline newline  it s a virus . an exquisitely designed one . i m not going to die . i m going to live , in so many ways . have you been breathing lately ?  the air was laced with cells , each modified specially to spread what would be karker s greatest mark on the world . the end of it . newline newline  you re insane .  newline newline  you re a vector . say hello to the guards on the way out . then , your wife , your son , your mother , your father , and the rest of the world . because , the times , theyreachanging , my friend . and it ai nt just me who s gon na be a little sick then .  karker laughed , a sort of halfwheeze , halfguffaw that went on until he could barely breathe . newline newline the interrogator looked towards his pistol .it s a type of special goblingremlin hybrid team that specializes in cloth . newline newline  ... what ? newline newline yeah , like a magical fashion police. he took a sip of the hot coffee . newline newline  ... so , fashionexpert goblins that ca nt eat after midnight steal all of your clothes every wednesday , exactly at 9:17am ... ? newline newline exactly what i said , and exactly what happens . every wednesday morning i wake up with grunts and noises from my closet , and then it s just empty . newline newline  ... i do nt know what to say edward ... this seems ... newline newline some weird crazy bullshit ? yeah , i know . and i do nt even know why i m telling you this , it s our first date . but fuck it , too late to back out now. he took a bigger sip , regretting it instantly after , as the coffee burned his throat on the way down . newline newline well , how for how long has that been happening ... ? newline newline it s been three years , the more or less . newline newline christ ... ! have you ever tried to stop them ? newline newline as any sane person would , i did . i almost blew up my closet once . newline newline how do you know how they look like ... ? newline newline i caught them on the act several times , actually . newline newline this is all really weird , to be honest ...  she seemed distant . newline newline  ... maybe i can show you ... newline newline a loud ding rang across the room . she quickly got up , said goodbye in a hurry like she was saved by the bell , and left , without giving edward any time to react . he sighed and took a last sip at the coffee as the next lady moved from the table to his left and sat on the chair across the table , in front of him . newline newline hi ! i m tiffany ! newline newline hey . edward . newline newline newline you may have one wish granted.  the genie said , with a smile . but , even before she said that i knew what i wanted . newline newline i only had one wish all these years .  i want my debts cleared ,  i told her firmly . newline newline  well , sweetheart , that depends on how much you owe.  she said . newline newline i responded with a chuckle , and she was visibly taken aback by my reaction ,  oh , no you misunderstand ,  i said ,  my debts aren  t technically monetary.  newline newline  oh.  she replied , still confused . newline newline i took out a worn out , brown envelope from my bag .  lisvane presbyterian hospital  , it says across it . the genie opened it and took out its contents . she looked through pages and pages of medical papers . newline newline  i need you to find her family for me ,  i told the genie rather impatiently , as she was still scrutinising the contents of the documents ,  i need to settle my debt.  newline newline  well , this would certainly take a while ,  she said ,  but , i will do my best , and i will be in touch when we  re able to locate her family  s whereabouts.  newline newline  thank you very much . this would mean the world to me.  newline newline  newline newline i  ve only ever known her name : chamomile . yes , as in the kind you  d order for tea . they called her millie , my sister told me , as she sat by my hospital bed a few weeks after my surgery . i thought it was a beautiful name , and i regretted never having the chance to meet her . newline newline when i was ill , i had never wanted to use my wish i had from the genie . truth be told , i was too stubborn , and i was in denial . i didn  t want to face the fact that i was a ticking time bomb . i wanted to believe that someday i would be able to be defused . i thought that making a wish means that i would have given in and i ve officially let this chronic illness be a part of me . newline newline since that fateful surgery 10 years ago , i have never been in my worst state anymore . i  ve accepted that i  m never going to be 100  cured . not until someone makes a significant medical breakthrough . i  m still going to have to deal with flares , and i will still have relapses and episodes . but , i  ve never been as weak as i was before . newline newline when the genie told me i could still use my wish  even 10 years after they first contacted me  i decided that this is the right time . i need to settle my debt . i owed millie my life . newline newline  newline newline the genie found millie s family a couple of months after my visit . they told me that millie  s father had passed away long ago , unfortunately , but her mother now lives in a nursing home in the outskirts of town . i called up the nursing home and asked to see her during visitation hours the next day . newline newline when i got there , the nurse at reception greeted me warmly .  you  ve come at a perfect time , actually ,  she said as she led me to the dining hall ,  we  re celebrating her birthday today . she would be thrilled to see you.  newline newline i was quite taken aback by this . this wouldn  t be an ordinary meeting . besides , i don  t know how she would react to seeing me . i don  t know if it would make her happy , or sad or if she would resent me . newline newline when we reached the dining hall , the party was in full swing . coltrane was playing through the speakers , and a group of about 20 residents were sitting in one long table . there was cake , party hats and streamers hung around the room . i never thought a nursing home  s atmosphere could be this lively . newline newline  she loves coltrane ,  the nurse told me ,  big fan.  newline newline she comes up to an elderly woman with glowing white hair and a tiara on her head . she had make up on , looking classy as ever .  charlotte , someone is here to see you ,  the nurse told her . newline newline i came up to her , still trying to figure out what to say . my thoughts all jumbled up , and all i could say was ,  i  m lydia ,  i told her ,  lydia townsend.  immediately after i told her my name , tears welled up in her eyes , and she pulled me into a tight hug . i didn  t stop the tears from coming this time . newline newline  oh my ,  she said as she was still in my embrace . my heart must have been beating fast because she then asked ,  is that her , i hear ?  newline newline  yes ,  i said , still not letting go , because i know that the only greatest present she could receive on her birthday , is to hear millie  s heart beat again . newline newlinei never saw it . he never allowed it . newline newline i suppose if i had tried harder  if i had been a better friend newline newline hindsight is one of life  s greatest ironies . it paints the clearest and simplest truth only when it ceases to have any use . like the cry for peace and morality emerging after a genocide of millions . newline newline i remember when he was a kid . shy . weird . awkward . poisonous words to a young mind . i didn  t mind  he liked dragon ball z and that was good enough for me . newline newline grade school was rough till he learnt how to make fart sounds with his armpit . the teachers were horrified , but the class laughed . he smiled , perhaps for the first time since i  d known him . he  d keep that smile on his face for years to come . i should have known . newline newline we drifted away in middle school . i read books while he told jokes . he was effortlessly funny . it was his nature , his identity . everything was a joke  everyone a walking punchline . newline newline it was but a crust covering his inner core . newline newline he used to talk to me , though we were no longer friends . he would be sober , serious  not like he was with everyone else . i took offense  i didn  t like to be treated differently . turns out , neither did he . newline newline then came that day . everyone was shocked . newline newline  he was always so cheerful !  newline newline everyone thought they knew him . no one did but me  during those talks when he felt comfortable enough to drop the act . newline newline i was his only friend and i never saw it .sokka sat polishing his sword on pier at yue bay . he smiled at the irony that , of the two weapons he had lost on the day of sozin s comet , the sword had been the one to return . sheathing the black blade , he turned to face the man stood behind him .  cmon aang , sit down . i know you re an airbender but quit hovering , you re making me nervous .  newline newline the young nomad sat down beside his friend and stared across the bay . his eyes fell on his new home , the recently created 5th air temple . it was hard to believe that it had been 12 whole years since they had battled ozai for the fate of the world . newline newline sokka was looking at him now , a concerned expression on his face .  you ok , bud ?  newline newline  uh ... yeah ...  he sighed .  sokka ... if someone , just hypothetically , offered to give you bending ... would you take it ?  newline newline  hmmmm ... nah , i d pass .  he grinned .  why , you know someone who s going around making crazy offers like that ?  newline newline  ... i ve found a way .  aang said , his face downcast and his voice barely above a whisper . newline newline  no kidding ? you told anyone ?  aang simply shook his head . sokka clapped him on the shoulder .  probably best you do nt . could throw the balance out of ... balance ? or something like that , i do nt know .  he tailed off .  that sounded a lot better in my head .  newline newline aang gave a nervous chuckle , letting go of a breath he had nt realized he was holding .  so , no bending ? why ?  newline newline  it s who i am . just like toph s an earthbender , zuko s a firebender , katara is a waterbender and you are the avatar . i m just the guy in the group who s regular . the guy with a sword and a boomerang . i never asked for all this flying and magic ... but i m glad i got to be part of it . i would nt know where to begin with bending , but i manage just fine without . i do nt need bending , i have my sword , my friends ...  a clock struck noon and sokka paled  ... and a wedding to get to . how do i look ?  newline newline aang looked at sokka , a far cry from the irritable teen who had pulled him from the iceberg all those years ago . the wolf warrior stood proud in his armour , look of abject terror not withstanding .  you look fine sokka . besides suki would nt care if you turned up in a potato sack .  newline newline  thanks aang ... say , could you give me a lift ? i kinda need to get to city hall in five minutes . i m the first to break the long silence . newline newline  well , this is awkward .  newline newline he grins at me , a perfect smile that speaks of charisma and pride and money . newline newline gesturing at the blade in my hand , he says ,  why do nt you put that away and come in for something to drink ?  newline newline as though the blade in my hand was made of rubber . as though we were old friends , and he d never wronged me . as though i was not here to kill him in less than an hour . newline newline wordlessly , i follow him inside his mansion . i do nt bother to take off my shoes . dead men do nt have to worry about dirt . newline newline we go into his lounge . a ushaped couch sits around a coffee table . a tv larger than any window in my house is mounted up on the wall in front of the couch . the west wall is made entirely of glass , facing a gorgeous lake landscape . the setting sun sinks into the lake , bleeding cherry red and clementine orange into the still waters . newline newline on the opposite wall is a small bar . he holds up a glass . newline newline  can i get you anything ?  he offers me .  a scotch , maybe a gin and tonic ?  newline newline  coffee .  i say flatly .  black .  newline newline minutes later , he brings me my drink . he and i take seats on opposite ends of the horseshoe couch . newline newline sipping his scotch , he remarks lightly ,  i always knew you would come for me .  newline newline i grit my teeth .  is that so ? how insightful of you .  newline newline  i do nt think murdering me is a solution to your troubles , but clearly , you ve already made up your mind .  his pretty blue eyes are earnest and sympathetic . newline newline what a beautiful face for such a filthy rat . newline newline  i sent you countless emails with solutions  , i growl at him .  you did nt bother to reply to any of them .  newline newline he looks contrite .  a blunder on my part , then , i must confess .  newline newline  a blunder ? tell me , then , was it a blunder when you ran out on me after two years of being in a committed relationship ? a blunder when you stole my manuscript , which i d worked tirelessly on for years ? a blunder when you published the whole thing under your name ? with no credit or attribution to me , not even in the dedication or author s note ?  newline newline he sits , his expression of sympathy getting more and more pronounced . i have the urge to fling my coffee cup at him , but the time is not yet right . i glance at the clock . thirtyfour minutes left . newline newline  perhaps we can talk this out ,  he suggests .  i ll admit it . i was an asshole back then . your book was brilliant . i saw a lot of potential in it , and i knew i could never write anything that engaging . so i stole it . i m not proud of it . i should have credited you , sent you half of the money i ve made .  newline newline  you want to talk this out now ? you had your chance !  i spit at him . newline newline  here s what i m willing to offer ,  he says diplomatically .  the tenthedition copies are being planned right now . i ll rewrite my author s note crediting you as my inspiration . i ll send you 50  of all the money ever made , and we can collaborate on my next book .  newline newline  no .  my voice cracks like a whip . newline newline  no ?  newline newline  your life is on the line . i know you can do better than that .  newline newline  what do you want ?  newline newline  you know what i want .  newline newline  you ll have to be more clear .  newline newline  you have exactly twentynine more minutes to play games with me . then i m going to carve you like a thanksgiving turkey . use your powers of inference , genius .  newline newline he inhales . he s silent for a few minutes , thinking deeply . his face hardens . newline newline  i ve burnt the original manuscript . there s no evidence left that you had any hand in this . i do nt have to give you anything .  newline newline  you do nt ,  i agree cheerfully . i slide out my blade again , the silver catching the dying light of the sun .  i do nt have to spare your miserable life either .  newline newline his breath catches . there s another pause . newline newline  what do you want me to do ?  he shouts at me .  i ve already given you a great deal considering i do nt owe you shit .  newline newline  you re going to admit that you plagiarized my book ,  i say slowly .  i want every single penny you ve made off my work . and you are going to forfeit your rights to any movie deals you might have signed .  newline newline he laughs .  do nt be ridiculous ! seventy percent of profits , and a fifty percent royalty from the movie . i ll put your name in the author s note . refer you to an agent . done .  newline newline  admit you plagiarized my book to the public .  newline newline  that ll be the end of my career !  newline newline  the end of your life is about to come in around twenty minutes !  i snap back . newline newline a vein pulses in his forehead .  fine !  newline newline i nod towards the door .  go . get two sheets of paper . we re going to draw up a deal and sign it .  newline newline fifteen minutes later , a rough business deal has been drawn up . he will admit to stealing my book . he will give me 90  of the profits he s made . and i get rights to any sequels or movies . newline newline the pen scratches as he signs . as soon as his hand clears the paper , the clock begins to chime . newline newline  are we good now ?  he asks . newline newline i drive my knife into his stomach . his eyes widen in shock and his mouth gapes like a fish . newline newline  oh , honey , we re perfect ,  i croon . newlinevenn and ludwig were at the bar , drinking up their salaries and joking about their foremen . katrina had just finished sweeping up the floor , and i was wiping down the counter . for a second , everything seemed perfect : the lanterns lit the room just enough to keep it welcoming , but not enough to notice the scars on anyone s faces . i had surplus of booze for once . maybe everything would start turning around after the last disaster we had . maybe newline newline the door creaked open , and three of four guys swathed in pelts walked in . not an unusual occurrence , since i see travelers all the time , but they had swords strapped to their sides that had dried , crusty blood on them . not a good sign . two approached me , asking questions about prices and the general area . i answered politely , telling them about the mountains and how much a pint of beer would cost . they thanked me and said goodbye , and turned to leave . newline newline but no . the next thing i know , all the wooden barrels i keep to sit on are wrecked . just slashed to splinters . all my jugs behind the bar are shattered . venn and ludwig are bleeding all over the bar . or , to be more specific , their heads are bleeding all over the bar  their bodies are left in a heap on the floor . the random guys are tipping over tables , waving their swords around , destroying everything they get their hands on . i managed to pull katrina behind the bar and duck , just dodging a sword swipe . newline newline as soon as they realized there was nothing among the splinters and shards of pottery that could be useful , the stormed out , growling to themselves about needing to restock . as the door closed , katrina cautiously stepped out from behind the bar . she waited a second , then shrugged , picked up the broom again , and started to sweep . i groaned . great . two more corpses to put out back . if those idiotic adventurers do nt stop coming here , soon my whole clientele will be dead . newline i heaved the bodies into the pit out back , and went back inside . i was just wiping the blood off the counter when oleg and christopher walked in . they ordered a couple beers and sat down , laughing about god knows what . katrina had pulled out some extra barrels for seating , and was just finishing sweeping up when the door opened ...no one knows where the books come from . but on everyone s sixteenth birthday , a book appears within a foot of them . personally i have seen a few of the books myself , most of them were long , enough to hold ninety years of life inside the covers . if a child dies before their sixteenth birthday , the book does nt appear , it as if some higher being decided that sixteen is when life really starts . newline newline so when my book faintly began appearing i smiled . i watched as the covers appeared first , a dark rich blue , gold leaf wrapping around , beginning to inscribe my name . as soon as the cover was solid , i inched my bloody , shackled wrist to flip it open , waiting for the pages to appear . newline newline except they did nt , because right at that moment i heard a faint ringing of a gunshot and my consciousness faded . and as i lay bleeding out the pages in my book stopped appearing , as if sensing my death . newline newline the last thing i saw was a hand reaching down and picking up my uncompleted book . then his laugh rang out , as if somehow my halfcompleted book had completed his goal of trying to uncover god . i  m your wife ,  said the woman standing in front of the wallmounted display . my wallmounted display . newline newline  i have never met you before ,  i said . my voice sounded oddly formal . newline newline  listen , i can get you out of here ,  said the woman . she leaned closer to the monitor and whispered in the microphone .  don  t you want to find the man that killed you ? killed your parents ?  newline newline  my parents are dead ?  i said , louder than the woman . i distracted two people away from their own monitors . newline newline  yes ,  the woman said ,  but keep your voice down.  she glanced around the room . newline newline everyone had resumed speaking to the screen they came here for . i counted thirtyseven people . that left about sixty screens , or cyberpersons , lonely . newline newline  someone killed them ?  i said , matching her pitch and tone .  and you  re my wife ?  newline newline  i can explain more once we are free and clear ,  she said . the woman slipped a flash drive out of her pocket and held it so only i could see .  i need you to get in here.  newline newline  you  re crazy . even i remember that you can  t bring those into the mausoleum.  newline newline  the man responsible for putting you in here is on the way . he  s going to kill me and delete you permanently . i love you , jake . i am here to save you.  newline newline the woman looks desperate , i thought . if i get on that stick , she could crush me into oblivion with the heel of her boot . was there really someone coming for me ? would they be able to get at me , even in this place ? newline newline the woman held the flash drive up to the port . she mouthed  please.  newline newline she doesn  t look innocent , i thought . evil ? a liar ? no . battlehardened and loyal ? maybe . not doelike though . what the hell happened in the last three months that got me involved with this woman and dead ? newline newline  if not for me , then for your parents ,  she said . newline newline  where are they ? i can  t find them in the directory.  newline newline the woman hesitated . she almost put down the flash drive , but then caught her resolve .  he got to them already.  newline newline  you mean , they  re gone ? completely ?  newline newline the woman nodded slowly .  i didn  t want to tell you like this . not here . but this is why you need to come with me.  she held up the drive . newline newline this was too much to bear , i thought . if what she was saying was true , then i had to go . but then again , what if she wasn  t ? i couldn  t go with her . there was too much risk . i was better off remaining in my new home . newline newline the door across the room burst open . three men in suits walked in . they stood in the doorway , scanning the room . newline newline the woman whipped back to my screen .  hurry !  she jammed the drive into the port . newline newline a tunnel opened to my left . i glanced once more at the woman . then at the men . and finally at the hole . i felt uneasy . i felt sick . the reasoning did not make any sense . but i had to choose . i dove in . they were beautiful . the exiles that came through the portal . they were beautiful . the portal opened up and was framed with a double rainbow . i saw a fantastic sculptured city , all glass and chrome . it was so futuristic . from the portal , i saw men and women like us , walking and talking and laughing , just like us . it was beautiful . it was so freaking beautiful . the exiles came through the portal , driven before the others and from all of humanity , they chose to make first contact with me . i gave them my watch as a gift between our two people . they gave me a pill in return . it was so i could understand them . think about it , a pill that conveys the understanding of one people to another . i took the pill and spoke to them at length . they told me of their culture , of their cities , of their people . i told them about new york . i told them about the magnificience that was america . i told them all about us . i felt obliged to get them my own money so that they could experience the joy of shopping in new york . they told me it was their custom to never accept gifts , only barters . they gave me more of the pills to pass out amongst our people so that we may all come to know of their people . i ve adopted their custom , sir . i was bartering the pills for other items amongst our own people . it was an exchange of cultures sir . they ve gone back just now to relate this wonder of our world to their own people . the portal is closed now , but they promised it would open again , and soon .  newline newline  well , dat is the most ridiculous story i have eer heard explaining how a pound o meth came to be in a drug dealer s pocket .  officer omalley declared , snorting with mirth . newline newline  so , you will let me go ?  vic asked , hopefully . newline newline  come on , you . do nt to central holding .  officer omalley declared pushing the dealer before him . is , is that a dragon ?  the question came from nowhere . i felt a tug on my pants and looked down to see a girl , no older than ten , looking at the dragonshaped mark that spiraled up my arm . newline newline i d heard the question more times than i could count , and i knew what the follow up would be . newline newline  so does that mean ... ?  newline newline  no .  maybe a little more callous than was fair .  i ca nt breathe fire . i ca nt fly .  newline newline  but can you turn into a   newline newline  no .  newline newline i turned and walked away . i ve come to expect that this will happen when i go out in public , especially when i do nt cover the mark , but i thought i could make it to the corner caf for a quick coffee without being hassled . especially not by a little girl . i started heading back to my apartment , no longer craving caffeine . newline newline i heard the sound of footsteps and then another tug . newline newline  but are you sure ?  it was the girl . where the hell were her parents ? newline newline  yes . yes i m sure . it does nt mean anything . it s just a birthmark ,  i said , lowering myself down to her level .  i ve had it as long as i can remember , and even though it seems cool , like i could be a dragon , i m just a normal person .  newline newline  oh ,  her gaze lowered . i actually felt kind of bad . like i d killed this girls dreams of seeing a real dragon . she did nt look up . newline newline i followed her eyes to see what she was looking at . her own arm , completely uncovered just like mine . on it , a mark , much like my own . serpentine and twirling from her wrist to her elbow . winged and horned . i felt even worse . newline newline  hey , it s alright ,  i tried to reassure her .  it s a great conversation starter . it just stinks that fantasy stuff is nt real or else you and i would be   newline newline  maybe for you .  she did nt look up . newline newline  for me ? what do you mean ?  newline newline she stepped back from me , never looking up . slowly , her mark began to glow . her pale , smooth complexion turned coarse and scaley . she became flushed in a deep purple , and then i heard a rip . newline newline two wings sprouted out from her shirt as a tale ripped through her pants . her body coiled and transformed right in front of my eyes . newline newline i was speechless . newline newline after the transformation , which took mere moments , she it reached out and touched my arm . newline newline  sorry .  i heard the word from nowhere , her mouth did not move . newline newline she jumped and her wings pushed the air around her . newline newline as quickly as she d appeared she was gone . no one around us seemed to have noticed what had just happened . newline newline i looked down at my arm , wondering what i d just seen . and then , for the first time , my mark began to glow .a bodily caramelbrown baby nestled as tight as a christmas gift rested on my asshole neighbor  s lawn  no pun intended  . and it was from me this time . i wanted him to know to stay away from my dog . newline newline in my life , i  ve had plenty of dogs , but none like chaz . chaz the spaz . he  s a giant great dane , all black with white spots . every time i come home from work , chaz jumps up and puts his arms on my shoulders . i  m so glad my ex hated him so i got to keep him . newline newline now chaz has a healthy appetite . he  s huge and can eat about the same amount as i can and i  m no chihuahua myself . takes about half my paycheck to feed him and more to pay for my fence . newline newline i have a treeless , crappy backyard with a brokendown fence . plus the fence is like five feet high . chaz the spaz , god knows how , manages to jump over it sometimes , and the first thing he does ? takes smooth , boa constrictorlike intestinal exodus onto my old neighbor herb  s lawn . newline newline i clean these towering tan mountains down as soon as my little boy makes  um , but of course , some slip through the cracks . herb lets me know , over and over , and i work during the day , so it  s hard to find them . i always apologize . but not this time . newline i found cheese with glass shards in it . in the backyard . enjoy herb ! newlineso many years have passed since that night in san genova . i still remember each moment as clearly as cut glass . newline newline we were entering into a new world . we read in the papers of the heroes ... of their powers , their garish costumes . it felt a little theatrical , a little unreal . like a little bit of fiction was seeping through some unseen crack in the universe . newline newline then , the catastrophes . cities leveled to radioactive ash , skyscrapers cracked and thrown about like children s toys . these were nt men , fighting and flying through the streets . newline newline i once had the privilege to watch highflame during a parade through the city square . he stood a hand and a half taller than any man , and his body flickered and pulsed with living wreathes of white fire . newline newline he did not speak to us . watching his stark silhouette glowing brilliant against the twilight , i was filled with the horrible sensation of falseness  as if he were something terrifying and alien , stuffed into an illfitting human skin . newline newline at the moment of this very thought , his brilliant violet eyes found mine , and flashed once  twice . mocking me . newline newline no , these were not men  they were gods . and to play out their little romances , their petty grudges and adventures , they killed millions . newline newline we fled the cities in droves , only to find that the gods followed us wherever we roamed . what good is godhead without a captive , prayerful audience ? they fed off our adulation , our fear . newline newline it in this moment of utter despair that he rose from the least of us . i know very little about who he was , or what drove him to become humanity s final martyr . i know only these events as they transpired , november 30th in the city hall of san genova : newline newline   newline newline   newline newline moonlight gleams in silver shafts from the few remaining towers of the city main . let them paint a picture : a lone man , shoulders slumped . his clothes are slick with grease and ash  a weighty but worn toolbelt pools around his knees . newline newline he is cradling the charred remnants of a oncehuman body . punishing , ungodly heat has scored away flesh and gristle , leaving only a collection of blackened bone . these he touches gently , aware of the grotesque insignificance of it all , but far past the point of caring . newline newline above him towers the olympian figure of the great hero highflame . all light shies away from his harsh and crackling form . newline newline she was in the way .  he says , with a voice like a million bonfires roaring in unison . do try to understand .  newline newline a silent crowd has gathered now , watching from their windows , stoops and store corners . they know better than to interfere . newline newline and at the end of the day , you know she was only a ...  the hero pauses for a moment  is it possible ? do even gods feel guilt ?   newline newline well she was nt anyone important he finishes lamely . newline newline the man stiffens at these words . his threadbare shoulders , in that instant , seem to carry the weight of the world . newline newline  her name was samantha .  he whispers hoarsely . then , without warning he reaches to his waist . when his hand returns , it is firmly clenched around the shaft of a gleaming wrench . newline newline the great olympian hero rears to his full , godlike height . fire runs in brilliant rivers up and down his sculpted length . newline newline you ca nt be serious ?  he asks , as would any god challenged by an insect . newline newline this man  this insignificant gnat , does nt waver . and in that moment he is glorious  his ashen rags are armor , his wrench is the shining edge of excalibur .  newline newline  we wo nt live like this .  he says . newline newline a heartbeat , a fateful swing   newline newline the smell of sizzling flesh ... newline newline   newline   newline the rest is illusion , insignificant . remember only this : against the gods themselves , a man chose , chose against all reason , to stand . his name is unimportant . he is all men , and all men reflect him . newline newline i choose not to remember what happened next . and on quiet nights , when the moon is full , i spit  newline newline and a small but brilliant white star will blink at me from the horizon . newline newline once , twice . newline newline mocking me . newlinethe fall of the berlin wall had been a happy event , celebrated not only in germany but all over the world . in the months after it was nt only the economy that benefited from the fall , but other areas improved as well . there were less crime , especially in the eastern part of the city , but in june something weird happened , as deaths related to fires had gone down by 93  , and it would turn out that it would stay that way for years to come . even though many of the horrible statistics had gone down since the fall of the wall , this one were an outlier , as it had such a dramatic drop . newline newline at the time it had gone by without much notice , and it was not until i got the job in 1999 , that the truth was uncovered . it was the one and only time , where my job as a statistician had resulted in someone going to jail . newline i had spent the first few weeks after getting the job by looking at all sorts of statistics in the months after the fall . but nothing really indicated why there would be such a drastic drop in fire related deaths in june . that was until i discovered something awful , and it was purely by accidents . newline newline i had not thought of looking much into statistics from before the fall of the wall , but one day i got hold of a prefall statistic that showed that many people from all over europe with fire related criminal records , had immigrated to west berlin . in this city divided by a huge wall had they found their paradise . they had settled in the richer western part of berlin , and they had struck a deal with the russian guards of the wall , that frequently would let them through the wall into east berlin , which were much poorer compared to west berlin , and therefore not as cared for by the outside world . they would run around east berlin and satisfy their twisted need . newline newline that was the reason for the drop in fire related deaths in june of 1989 , the wall were no longer there , and the criminals could no longer run around with fear of consequences . my report made a few of the guilty people go to jail , buy many more could not be identified and probably left berlin not long after the fall of the wall . newline newlinewhen first contact happened , i was delivering a large pepperoni pizza . the guy who ordered it told me to come inside , and i was about to say no , fearing a mugging or something , when i saw his tv at the end of the appartment . the news channel was broadcasting a speech by the united nations secretarygeneral . it looked important , so i walked in and we listened to it over pizza and coke . we had received a communication from alien sources and the world was never the same again . newline newline a few years afterwards , i was runnning my own pizza place , and the governments of the world were planning the future landing of alien dignitaries . the aliens had a similar digestive system to ours , and it was decided that the meeting would be accompanied by a hearty lunch . culinary experts were brought in from all around the world and they chose french cuisine as the pinacle of human food , to be served at the meeting . newline newline when the aliens arrived at the un headquarters in new york , the large tables were set , heads of state from over one hundred nations were sitting , and i was delivering two small funghi to a close neighbourhood . who could have guessed that after devouring the lunch in a few minutes , the aliens  ultra sensitive olfact senses would pick up my pizza s smell ? amidst divulging fasterthanlight technology , they aked for the source of that odor and the un sent a full swat team after me . at the time , i had been delivering pizza in new york for years and it took the squad a full two hours to catch me , but soon i was back at the restaurant preparing for the most important food delivery in the history of both pizza and humankind . they loved it . newline newline soon , our pale blue dot was welcoming species from all over the galaxy and i opened my own place , specialized in delivering to those with more two eyes and purple skin . within a few years , i was way ahead of the competition and bought a license for extraatmospheric commercial transport . with the tecnology which was now available to us , i the proud owner of the first interstellar pizza delivery service . at first , we counted on humans again  those that had been colonizing new asteroids and moons often craved that simple greasy italiancreated , americanmade fast food . however , the aliens that had enjoyed my pizzas back on earth quickly spread the word and i was getting orders from all sectors and races . they were ridiculously addicted to it and my ships were given immunity , so i could deliver to both sides of the countless skirmishes , conflits and wars that shook the galactic theatre every cycle . newline newline in fact , my cargo became so valuable , they made truces while pizza was being delivered , lest they accidentally shot a delivery ship . i was getting so many orders that entire wars were essentially stopped while my pilots manouvered around asteroids , comets and moons to feed those craving aliens . newline newline and that is the story of how my pizzas brought peace to a longstanding warring galaxy . pax pizzana .the elder troll sat silently in his chair . his long gray robes draped over his frail body . the chair made from an old oak long since felled by magical hands . they called him  he who decides  . he raised a gnarled moss colored hand . his knobby index finger beckoned to the crowd . newline newline  who else needs my wisdom ?  the ancient creature said .  come forward !  newline newline two statuesque creatures pushed through the crowd . dressed in the royal regalia of elf royalty . they knelt down and bowed respectfully to the troll elder . between them servants carried a red silk pillow cradling a small child . newline newline  oh great wise one ,  the tall female said .  we have traveled far to seek your advice on an important matter .  newline newline  what is your predicament ?  newline newline  we have not yet figured a name for our daughter .  newline newline  many have tried your grace ,  the tall male said ,  none of the names were suitable enough for her . there is much stress and division among the elven nations because of this . we are long overdue for the naming ceremony .  newline newline  i sympathize with your plight king finikin and queen fussbudget . i really do . i , in my infinite deciding capacity will see what i can do . bring the child forward .  newline newline the servant brought the pillow up to the front before the elder troll s oaken chair . he who decides stood up and walked toward the child . he picked the newborn girl up in his old gnarly arms and examined the baby . her skin glowed pink with elven youth . the girl drooled and cooed in the old troll s scraggly arms . she was nt phased by the ugly site of the elder troll . newline newline the troll brought his finger close to her cheek and extended in order to see if she would grab hold of it . immediately she opened her mouth wide and chomped down on the extended finger . her single tooth dug into the scraggly elder s finger . newline newline  aaaah !  the troll screamed trying to pull the persistant child s mouth off .  she has such a grip !  newline newline the elf king and queen rushed over to the elder troll who now had the child hanging onto his hand for dear life . finikin pried open his daughter s mouth while fussbudget grabbed her child by the sides ready to pull the child off . when everything calmed down he who decides returned to his chair . newline newline  we re really sorry your wiseness . she bites people on occasion . she hasbeen teething lately .  newline newline the troll elder raised his wounded hand to stop the two elves .  say no more ! i have come to a decision on what to name your child . from henceforth your daughter shall be known as bites people . you may go .  newline newline  oh wise one .  finikin tried to reason with the elder troll ,  surely you do nt mean to give a child such a name ? especially one of noble birth ?  newline newline a heavily armed troll stepped up from the side ,  the elder has spoken . begone with you .  newline newline finikin sighed .  you are the wise one ,  he said ,  bites people it is .  newline newline with that the elven party took their leave for the long journey back to their kingdom . what do we got , jim ?  asked detective murray . the question had become so routine that the sentence congealed into a single word   whaddoowegahggim .  newline newline  mass shooting . nasty shit , ed ,  said smith , his partner , who had arrived on the scene ten minutes earlier . newline newline  walk me through it .  newline newline detective smith led murray over to a dead crow lying in the dirt . its legs were curled up , its left wing was blown apart , and a single chunk of halfchewed wheat hung out of its beak . a small pool of blood had formed on the ground beneath the corpse . newline newline  few kids were having a picnic when our guy opened up on em . poor bastard here was shot takin  a bite out of his sandwich . shooter wasted him from a distance  poor fuck never had a chance .  newline newline  we got a name ?  newline newline  no id on him or any of the others .  newline newline  show me .  newline newline detective smith walked to the second body , and murray followed . this victim was lying on her side , her head mutilated by the round that had entered it . blood had poured out of her shattered scalp and leaked out of what was left of her beak . a heap of vomit lay on the dirt behind the corpse . newline newline  fuckin  beat cop puked real good when he saw the db ,  smith explained .  rookie never seen a head blown apart before .  newline newline  rook , eh ? you pull a caruso on him ?  newline newline  yeah , i did . told him   and for a moment , smith s voice dropped low in imitation of the csi actor   i guess she ... got her head blown off by a goddamned psycho .  never been good at puns .  newline newline  how many more bodies ?  newline newline  one more . follow me .  newline newline the two detectives approached the last body  by far the most gruesome kill of the three . the corpse was peppered with bulletholes , and surrounded by flung chunks of its own skin , bone , and feathers . newline newline  shooter popped the kid once from a distance , then walked up and shot him nine times at pointblank range .  newline newline  think it was someone they knew ?  newline newline  maybe our guy had it out for them . hell , maybe he was just fuckin  nuts . crime boys re gon na run the shell casings and get us an answer . all we can do in the meantime s canvas the neighborhood , see if anyone saw anything . the lights flickered as they came to life . the man slumped down into the chair beside him . muffled shouts and noises could be heard outside , the last moments of the men and women still out there . newline newline blood began to soak through his jacket . his entire left side a hot sticky mess . he did nt know how much he had lost but he needed to stop it soon or he would be joining the people who got stuck out there . newline newline the room he was in looked like it had nt been used in years , with all the fighting going on he was nt surprised . a thick layer of dust covered everything . plates still on their table . whoever lived here before left in a hurry . newline newline the man dragged himself over to the sink and turned the tap praying for water . the old pipes clanked , spluttered and nothing more . with a sharp intake of breath he peeled the jacket from his body . the cuts on his side were not as deep as he thought but clean enough that they should heal well , they looked as though he had been flayed with razor blades . he grabbed an old towel and dusted it off as best he could . using his belt he fastened it around his body , keeping pressure on the wounds . newline newline the noises outside had stopped . whatever fighting had ended , there was no way of telling who had won . the man walked over to a mirror and wiped it clean . the blood on his hands made his reflection look like it had red hair instead of the blonde he really had . he was pale , probably from blood loss but he was still alive . his years of training his body had allowed him to survive . newline newline the lights in the room flickered again , a soft hum now filled the room from a nearby generator . there was no telling how long he would have any power here . newline newline  he s in here ! he has to be i saw him run this way !  newline newline the man held his breath . they found him . he was trapped , unarmed . there s no telling what horrors they would have at their disposal for finding him , for killing him . newline newline he could hear footsteps coming up the hallway , he flung himself into another room and pushed the door over slowly . newline newline a quick glance about showed he was in a child s room . a young boy it seems . he left in a hurry too , clothes strewn all over the floor , drawers spilling their belongings out here and there.the voices were close now . newline newline  the lights are on . where did he go ?  one asked newline  i found his jacket , he s injured ! he wo nt be far  came the reply newline newline the man held his breath . his heart skipped a beat as he looked down and saw a trail of blood from his ribs to the door . newline newline  in there  newline newline the man flung himself at the door , using what strength he had left to try and hold them off . newline newline  take the door down !  newline newline newline the man was flung across the room , his body sparked with new pain . a powerful jet of water had destroyed the door and had soaked the rooms.the man was caught behind the bed , his leg pinned down by an old wardrobe . the room in complete disarray . newline newline his enemies stood in the other room just before him , their weapons pointed his way . the man did nt have long left . newline newline his eyes dropped toward the ground . no fight left in him . he saw it there . a ball . they had left in such a hurry the boy who lived here left his most prized possession . he was out of options , this was his only hope . newline newline he pushed the button on the ball . his enemies jumped back at the flash of red light , they thought he was unarmed , they had taken his weapon from him in the battle outside . newline newline it appeared before them , as confused as they were . this was not what it knew . the man on the ground looked at it and it looked back at him . in that moment it knew what it had to do . newline newline  thunderbolt !  the man choked on his own blood . newline newline with a flash the room erupted into nothing but light . the enemies and their weapons now lay on the ground still . the soaked rooms only made it easier . it s a horrible thing to take a life but sometimes it s kill or be killed . newline newline the man dragged himself across the ground toward his new ally . he owed it so much and more . it went over to his bloodied jacket and brought it to him . newline newline scorched , soaked and covered with blood his jacket had seen better days . the display of rank on it still visible he pulled it around his shoulders . lieutenant . his new ally walked alongside him as they left the destruction behind them . newline newline he did nt know if it felt regret for what it had done , however he knew in the moment their eyes locked it wanted to protect him , perhaps as it was supposed to do for the boy who had once been it s owner , it s friend . newline newline as they walked to their next warzone the soldier reflected on how his world works . it s not perfect but it s perfectly suited for the world they live in . newline newline a government commands  a soldier obeys . newline newline a man chooses  a pokemon obeys .picture it in your head , a frozen tableau . at one end of the hallway , a tall bearded man , greasy brown hair , biker leathers . a gun gripped in one sweaty hand . at the other , a blonde wearing a tuxedo , smiling , holding a gun in a loose hold . she is not sweating . newline newline  you do nt have the guts , john ,  the woman said lightly .  you never did . remember that time you said you were leaving and then came crawling back the next day ?  newline newline  shut up ,  the man , john growls . his hand is shaking slightly , metal slick and cool beneath his fingers .  i wo nt be your bitch anymore .  newline newline the woman laughed , a delicate laugh as though she were at a dinner party .  oh , john , you say the most ridiculous things .  newline newline  stop calling me that . my friends call me john .  newline newline  dear , sweet john ...  the woman sighed , took a step closer . john tightened his grip on the gun , thumbed back the hammer . the woman ignored it .  if only you had nt walked in on us , i could have let you live .  newline newline  you ll be the one to die , cunt ,  john spat .  i thought you were low , but that ... ? what kind of psycho are you ?  newline newline the woman shrugged .  money s money . oh , do nt give me that look , john . i know you understand me . if it were nt for my income , we d both be out on the streets .  newline newline  i could have gotten a job ,  the man said .  i could have   newline newline  could have ? when you ve been looking for years and never found it ? you re useless , john . you re a liability . who the fuck would want to hire you ?  newline newline he took a step backwards . the blonde followed , a predatory smile upon her lips .  you should nt point that thing at someone unless you mean to use it .  newline newline he opened his mouth . newline newline a gunshot . newline newline  now what am i going to do with the body ... ?  newline i ca nt forget this time , not again  newline i grabbed a pen from its holder and ripped a slip of paper from a book , newline scribbling down a few words to help keep my mind focused on what i had to do . newline newline i ran out of the house , not even bothering to lock it , yanked the door to my car open and flung myself inside . where was i going again ? oh right , i had to get to the train station . why did i have to get there ? i do nt know i ll try remember on the way . newline newline i do nt recall how long i ve had this power and to be honest i do nt know whether it s a gift or a curse , i have the power to know when something terrible is about to happen eight hours in advance . the one thing that stops me from being a superhero is the fact that i have a terrible memory . i ll forget about my prophecy , my prediction , my revelation until i turn on the news at night and see what had happened . that s when jumps back into my head . it s a terrible feeling knowing you could have done something but your own forgetfulness stops you from saving lives . newline newline i ve gone off topic have nt i ? what am i doing again ? i glance at the slip of paper hoping it will help jog my memory . why the hell did i only write  train , boston  on it ? i was nearing the train station now so i picked up the pace . i m guessing i have to buy a train ticket to boston . i ditched my car on the side of the kerb and sprinted inside . i stared up at the illuminated board showing all the times and places for the train . fuck . the train to boston was leaving in three minutes . i quickly bought a ticket and darted toward the platform the train was going to be on . i was breathless when i arrived but i was there on time at least . i hopped on the train feeling relaxed , all sense of foreboding and dread had slipped from my mind . newline newline i fell asleep for half the trip before i was awoken with a jolt . it was like dj vu . i did nt realise was was happening until the train was tilting off the tracks and towards a steep drop . it was in that moment that all my memories of that day came flooding back . newline i m pretty sure it s a curse . newlinealright , i ve pretty much had it . i m not a homophobic or anything but i m getting pretty tired of people just assuming i m gay . like , come on , guys . i was the god of rainbows before the rainbow was even the official symbol for homosexuality in the first place ! people come up to me and are like ,  hey , jeff . i really appreciate you being open about your lifestyle choices .  first off , my name is nt jeff . let s get that cleared out of the way . second off , what lifestyle choices do you speak of ? i am a straight male who adds a bit of colour when there s rain and sun mixed together and instead of getting thanks , i get hate mail . yes , i have literally gotten homophobic hate mail from people , including the god of homophobia himself . god damn you , norman ! you sent 5 letters this week . could you chill out for a few minutes , please ? i swear , if you guys do nt stop making dumb assumptions , you people will be without rainbows for quite a while and that means no pots of gold . in turn , no pots of gold means there ll be a lot of angry leprechauns . so , unless you people want a leprechaun riot on your hands , i suggest you smarten up .ky  aira shifted uncomfortably in the steel frame . newline newline the single slab of dark

more simple lifestyle . newline newline the social media era dissolved by the year 2023 . the fallout was profound . society began to return to inpresence communication lifestyle . texting and email

down to the basement and he found the photo album that had belonged to his father , and his grandfather , and he brought it up and put it on the kitchen table and he sat there all afternoon , all

newline pyotr did not open the door . newline newline later in the day , as he left the house with his shotgun and his ammo and the scrapbook under his arm , he got a text from ksenija and saw a

turned into the street where sonja lived across from ivan , he saw that one of sonja s children was standing over the other in the garden . newline newline he readied his shotgun . newline newline pyotr , who had very pale eyes , waited by ivan s garden gate and listened to his brother s dog , also called sobaka , bark until the door was opened . newline newline the brothers stared at one another . newline newline sunday came , as sundays always do , and they buried him in the family plot , next to his father , and his father before him , and no one mentioned that his brother had killed him . newline newlineit had all come down to this . my thumbs were sore , but only god knew what would happen if i stopped now . on second thought , he probably did nt know , either . for all i knew , letting go might even result in nothing happening , the pain from pressing the two buttons for so long all for naught . after all , why would i have any reason to believe the buttons on this box i d been handed by the raggedlooking man actually did anything at all ? newline newline the eyes . it had been the man s eyes , wide and full of equal parts passion and fear . no alcohol had fouled the man s breath , no obvious signs of drug usage marked his skin . he d carefully passed it to me , taking great care to ensure my thumbs were positioned properly before running off , looking back fearfully . newline newline looking at the box , my first instinct was to discard it , as it appeared far from sanitary . it had the appearance of wet cardboard , with bits of other materials poking through , and while firm enough not to yield when applying pressure to the buttons , had some sponginess . despite it s appearance , it did nt feel wet , though it seemed to feel a good deal cooler than the air temperature . newline newline as i moved to set it down , i heard it ding . not any sort of mechanical ding , but a ding almost reminiscent of a song , like you d expect from some sort of awakened magical artifact in a fantasy story . the longer i held the box , the more complex the sound became , and i started to feel i could understand it , that it needed me . newline newline the thought of a box having some sort of sentience brought me back to reality , and i realized some hours had passed . day had turned to night , and the box now radiated with heat instead of cold . i fully intended to take the box to the authorities , but felt the box trying to worm its way into my head again with the first few steps i took . newline newline now , some may blame me for all that happened next , but my mind is mine . i was nt about to let some weird box take me over and become some zombie to do it s bidding . i threw the box as hard as i could , then ran as fast as i could in

pinpoint it , id say its the lack of fragrance . i wonder if i could smell a fart in here ? newline newline before i had a chance to let one rip and test my theory , a couple of white coats came in

the fifteen was up . the coats came marching through that one door and stood before me at my desk . they collected the pencil i snapped in half , and the questionare , which i answered  getfucked  newline newline after reading my response the two coats looked at eachother and then marched out without saying anything . i was escorted out of the facilities , met with my parents , and the we drove

some do not trust the logic of mankind or the many faiths . but they are too much of a coward and begin to commit suicide . many do it alone , a few get together and die in flocks , while the rest attack their enemies and then end their own existence . newline then there are the vultures . they pick at the bones and finish off what is nt dead . greed is their only driving force and all they see is opportunity . some realize it might be final hurah for the end of their world might at hand . others think it shall pass , and they believe that they will not be caught when the chaos and dust settles . then there are the vultures that do it becuase they have always wanted to but have never had to courage to go forth and commit their crimes . newline scientists are scrambling to unravel this mystery . they fear for their lives and those of their families . they are also curious as to why this happened . moving , studying , and researching as quickly as they could to claim the glory for solving this mystery . also wanting to be the one to fix and have an greater glory for saving the world , the people and all future generations . but alas , i do not the end of this tale . would any of you happen to know off hand ? newline  if there are mistakes , i apologize . wrote this on the fly . the seven glimmered in the void . the nightwatcher , surrounded by its own three moons orbited lazily about en , as en drifted about the twins , shining so very far away . sherrid never spent a walking eve at work . leisure was the only option with such a day ahead . any tension would be pointless , as any preparation had to have been completed for her long before now . newline newline the walking would not be the first , but the exploration of the worlds beyond was widely celebrated , and though fairly common , walkers were deeply respected for their work . of course , the modern walkers were broadly different from their ancient namesakes . those who walk the sky , whose famed exploits were in traveling the known world were , of course , limited by a sense of scope . many had the gift to bend the aether to some extent , but only in recent history , some 700 years , had the gift been expanded and developed to a greater potential . newline newline sherrid loved the contrast of the night , and the dawn , the glow of the nightwatcher , with the darkness of the dark core that made walking possible on such a scale . the dark had always been twined with power , indeed , the energies that are had a parallel in the dark aether , the mysterious force that willed the stars apart . hundreds of centuries of warring , peace , warring , peace , and seemingly endless hate had birthed the empire . fortune favoured the first prince , whose gracious character allowed peace to not only thrive , but , in his stead , persist through the centuries . with mystik population controls , there were always enough , but not too many people . so we looked inward , and discovered that there was more to the fabric of reality than simply specks of stuff , but the very fluids of mystik , as much as substance , flowed with many facets to make a whole . newline newline  henrik  newline newline  mistress ,  i answered . newline newline  kindly check the chamber for any inconsistencies .  newline newline with a nod of assent , i walked to the ark , itself a complex structure of not only dark , dark aether , and plain matter , but also the focused lifeforces of various mystikates . though it was unlike the my lady to worry , it was appropriate to ensure that everything was still in order , in accordance with our obligations to the throne . there stood the several dozen prisms , tethered to the floors , and , through twisting links with mystika and dark aether , to the core , itself a strange matter which one could neither see , nor feel , except for the strange pull it enacted constantly , almost purposefully . newline newline here lady sherrid would lift the walker skyward , into the void , and , from there , bend the aether between this world and another . the dark core would provide both a stable centre , and the means to remain oriented within the sphere . the living quarters were in good condition , and the facilities well maintained . it was unconditional that a walking be ended with a complete restoration immediately upon arrival . stone wards guarded against raging energies in the void , embedded into the corners of the inner chambers , newline newline    newline newline dawn , and the ascension would begin in only a few minutes . the world had been farsighted only seven months before the walker had returned from its previous survey , and proved not only a much more straightforward colony prospect , but also a more tantalising prospect in terms of prism resources . already , the walkings had consumed several thousand of the devices completely , and fully a quarter were in current use in terms of known stockpiles . but this new world was very interesting . the planet , while convenient for habitation , orbited a binary twin like en s own , but only one glowed with lifegiving power . the other was , though still massive , a smaller , massive block of pure prismic matter . whether it could be simply mined would bear some serious investigation , but could lead to not only centuries , but near eternities of walkings , as well as other important health and industrial services and mechanisms . newline newline  my lady , i have loaded your cases into storage , and locked down the food and seed stores ,  i reported . she glanced over , nodded smiling graciously , and turned back to her seeing glass . reports were streaming in of the launch conditions , and everything was favourable . newline newline  lord belig , engage prismatic control , activate four tenths across three quarter base ,  sherrid commanded the first officer . newline newline  my lady ,  belig acknowledged , touching command stones across his console . a basso rumbling groaned through the walker as sixteen prisms activated under very low energies , an increase of the downward pressure could be felt on the command surface , as the weight of the core engaged and pushed outwards , and suddenly , the orb lifted slightly , and turned around upon its axis . newline newline  all members , board and load personal belongings ,  sherrid announced across the speaking stones , from her perch on the apparent roof . the inversion offered a slightly loss of weight , and granted better focus for the walk commander . cases drifted in through the secondary port , followed by indentured servants like myself , and then the lords and ladies , followed by the commoners that comprised the bulk of every walking . newline newline the fully outfitted orb made final checks , and while i laid in my bunk for both safety and to prevent interruption , we elevated to the void , some 50 000 miles above the surface of en , in fact . a series of instruction were relayed back and forth between various officers and , although having taken part in these walkings many times , i had still no understanding of much of the meaning . newline

newline newline  begin walking .  newline newline the space around us was momentarily bent , as a surge or energy jumped from within the dark core to without , leaving us for the most unharmed . newline newline and suddenly , the lights pushed away from above us , while new , distorted stars filled the same space . the void had been bent , and was bending , and we were through . newline

mind your manners , henrik ,  my lady reprimanded me lightly . newline newline  you and yours will give me your energies .  i said , as the screams began .it s been 48 hrs since i placed that  amazon

been a full life of one offs in the soviet union and a few unmentionables in libya . unmentionables that left my life unrecognizable . when she walked out i saw it coming . when the kids stopped calling i saw that too . in the field they called me  fortune  because of my ability to know what s going to happen next . hell , i even knew when enough was going to be enough . i just wished enough had nt come in the loss of two of my finest on what was soon to be my last mission . no one blamed me but myself . i saw it coming and ignored the signs . age had crept up on my six and i pretended he

i should have known sooner but we all get rusty . i pretend to drop my bag of tobacco and stand up to brush it off . i bend over to pick it up while i grasp the .45 taped under the chair . the forest

floor . the fire is still burning . his warranty is still good and i know the policy will send another . i m just glad it did nt cost me a fortune .my heart started picking up speed as i thought about the transformation to come . what animal lurks beneath my skin waiting to be unleashed ? a warm familiar hand settled on top of mine .  baby look at me .  i gazed up into my boyfriend s reassuring eyes .  it will be fine . you have nothing to be afraid of .  my heart found its regular rhythm with his gentle reassurance . newline ever since humans can remember , everyone has received the wonderful ability to transform into their spirit animal on their eighteenth birthday . some people only transform once because they are afraid of or disgusted by their animal . but the thought of not spending as much time as possible in your second skin always baffled me . growing up on a farm exposed me to many animals , and the thought of being able to transform into any one of them excited me . who would nt want the grace of a deer , strength of a bear , or poise of a cat ? newline  still hoping for that lynx ?  kerby said , a glimmer of excitement in his eyes .  anything would be amazing , but yeah , lynx is my top choice .  i answered honestly . kerby is a few months older than me , and it has been hard not to feel jealous of him when he shifts into that amazing red fox . in just a few minutes i will finally be able to play with him in his other form . it is kinda an unspoken agreement that it is weird to interact with someone while they are in animal form and you human . it is kinda like you do nt want the other person to see you as a pet .  ugh , gross , you lovebirds need to tone it down with that icky hand holding  my dad remarked , bringing me back to the living room where he and my mom sat waiting for my transformation in a few short moments . with the mention of birds , i could practically feel wing beats in my chest . a ding  sounded from the kitchen , marking my birth hour .  showtime  someone said , but i could not tell who because of the blood rushing in my ears from fear . i suddenly could only see light , silvery and bright obscuring my vision . my body felt warm and electrified , and i could nt even make a sound . when i opened my eyes , i first saw my parent s eyes . then i knew something was wrong . i turned to see kerby , but he was in fox form . i did not know that foxes could look so terrified . i scrambled to the bathroom mirror . on two legs ? i could nt see my reflection because my eyes refused to open .  come on scaredy cat  i coaxed . when i opened my eyes all i could say was ,  definitely scared . but definitely not a cat . we sat at opposite ends of the kitchen table . the insurance paperwork sitting between the two of

do you know how many spouses end up in the financial deep end because of things like that ?  newline newline no dice . i wasn  t buying it . they sounded like desperate excuses , sinking beneath the

newline newline  you forged my signature.  i responded newline newline  wha ?  newline newline  you would  ve had to forge my signature . insurance companies wouldn  t let you just take out a policy without my approval . it  s to avoid fraud . you would  ve had to fake my signature , the witness , gotten my personal documents . you did this all without my knowledge . this wasn  t just a quick errand.  newline newline considering how i felt inside , i was being remarkably calm before the shitstorm that was about to hit . newline newline  you wanted to make sure that i didn  t find out about this . why ?  newline newline  you didn  t need to know  newline newline  bullshit ! what the fuck were you planning ?  newline newline silence filled the room as if it were a vacuum . he no longer could look at me . newline newline  i was never going to hurt you , if that  s what you think.  newline newline  really ? because i  ve watched enough csi to know that that is not normally the case in

thursday.  he whispered . newline newline  excuse me ?  newline newline  next thursday . you die from a brain haemorrhage . it  s caused from an aneurism which happens because of a weakening of your arteries in your brain . it  s not exactly known what causes it , but doctors guess it is a combination of high blood pressure and a birth defect where your arteries are softer than normal.  newline newline  what are you on about ?  newline newline  you die from a brain aneurism next week . it  s why i took out the insurance.  newline newline  there is no way you would know that and i wouldn  t . i went to the doctor just last month and he said nothing . wait ! are you two in cahoots ? is this some elaborate plan so you can split the money ? how can i even believe you ?  newline newline  it doesn  t matter if you do or if you don  t . you will still die . and no , the doctor isn  t in  cahoots  with me . he doesn  t know . in fact , noone will know until after the autopsy.  newline

cause of death . i  ve read it.  newline newline  how can you have read it if i  m still alive ?  newline he looked me in the eye . in that moment i realised what the truth was , even though i denied it . newline newline  no . this is bullshit . you are full of shit . stop fucking around and tell me the truth !  newline newline  you know the truth.  newline newline i started laughing . newline newline  okay , humour me , tell me what it is anyway.  newline newline  i  m from the future.  newline newline i laughed even louder . newline newline  i  m a time traveler . i was able to create a time machine and travel through time . that  s how i know all of this is going to happen.  newline newline i couldn  t look at him any longer . a maniacal smile was embedded on my face . newline newline  at first i tried changing the past . but it never worked . no matter what i did , i couldn  t change things that were already going to happen . it  s a fundamental of time travel , even in this time , but i thought i could overcome it . i can  t . what i did notice , however , was that i could do things that were incidental . things that would not change the original timeline . like taking out life insurance on a man who was going to die anyway.  newline newline he looked at me , sadness in his eyes . newline newline  nope . i  m sorry . if you expect me to believe that you  re a fucking time traveller , and that this ,  i said , waving my hand over the insurance forms ,  is just some ploy for you to make a quick buck , then you are crazier than i originally thought.  newline newline he carried my gaze . newline newline  originally , you die alone . in this house . noone notices until several weeks later when a stench emits from your house . what i offered you was companionship , love , and joy in your last months.  newline newline  let  s not forget the small fortune you get out of it ! if you  re such a saint , then why not tell me ?  newline newline  i did.you did not take it well.  newline newline  wait , we  ve done this before ?  newline newline  yes , i tried to tell you . tell you everything . you spent your last month  s sunk in a deep depression that you never came out of . by the end , death was a release for you.  newline newline i was silent . shocked without the ability to speak . newline newline  it doesn  t matter ,  he said , standing up  time will have its way . it always does . as for you  you won  t remember this . i  m going to go back and make sure that i hide these papers away so you can  t find them.  newline newline as he walked away i leapt from my seat and grabbed his hand . newline newline  wait , how many times have we done this ?  newline newline  hundreds.  he replied .  i have fallen in love with you hundreds of times and watched you die , hundreds of times . this next time will be the last . the money is for a new start.  newline newline i held his hand , scared to let go . my head was buzzing with incoherent thoughts , trying to arrange themselves in some semblance of sanity . eventually i let go . newline newline  will you miss me ?  i eventually say newline newline  i did  every time you left me . but i  ve learnt after all this time , that by reliving your death , over and over , i have stopped living . death is a part of the universe . i can  t escape that . i am a time traveler and so i have all the time in the world to experience . i can  t live out the rest of my days in this small part of it.  newline newline  don  t go back . stay . will you stay ?  newline

letter to his future self  was absolutely daft . why would that guy care about what past chuck did ? he  d already done it . plus , how the hell would a paper envelope survive being buried in the ground for 20 years ? it didn  t matter , though , he couldn  t exactly tell mary that her father refused the bonding activity she suggested , that he thought it was arguably the dumbest thing since soapflavored milk . instead , he closed his mouth and scribbled a few lines of text on a sheet of looseleaf paper while she sat in the tiny , pink chair beside him . newline newline he  d begun with the basics : his nameas if future chuck wouldn  t already know thathis age of 37 , and the date : 4222015 . he then filled in a few lines about his hobbies , which at the time included sleeping , eating cheerios , and watching reruns of seinfeld .  while he was pretty confident that future chuck would probably care even less about this information than currentchuck did , he kept a smile across his lips as the pen dragged over the looseleaf . he had concluded the letter with a few updates on current events : the president still being barack obama , the constant state of unease with north korea , and that the world had recently begun misplacing , or otherwise destroying , airplanes . newline newline chuck glanced over at mary , the two of them standing over the shallow hole they had dug together . it was no more than a foot deep and clearly would not stand the test of time enough to support two paper envelopes , save for some miracle . digging anything deeper , however , was not an option . it had nearly destroyed chuck  s addled back to excavate the small hole . continuing would surely mean death , or at least mild discomfort . newline newline mary dropped her envelope in and turned toward chuck .  now you put yours in , daddy !  newline newline chuck sighed and held his hand out , white envelope addressed  to future chuck  clenched in his palm , and then released . it slowly tumbled toward the ground , like a falling feather , and landed softly beside mary  s . a third envelope immediately appeared beside where it had come to rest , a familiar handwriting scribbled across it . newline newline  good !  mary said , clapping her hands together , apparently unaware of the fact that one of their notes had cloned itself . she turned and wandered back over to her swing set , humming the chorus to  let it go  softly , just as she almost never stopped doing . newline newline chuck continued staring down at the hole , mentally struggling to make sense of the situation . perhaps he  d unknowingly carried two envelopes with him ? certainly he  d remember writing something on the front of both of them , rather than just the one . he took a deep breath and bent down , grabbing the third envelope and lifting it back up . it was addressed to  past chuck ,  the words scribbled in his own handwriting atop the clean , pearlcolored envelope . as far as chuck was aware , he was not past chuck . he was current chuck . regardless , it was still rather odd . he turned it over and ripped it open , then unfolded the note within : newline newline  dear past chuck , newline newline i hope this letter finds you well , as i  m sure it did . i sent it back in time , you see . that  s something we can do in the future , but only under strict supervision by our glorious leader of the democratic people s republic of west korea . these messages are reviewed by his wonderful , comfortably paid , and wellfed , employees prior to going out to citizens of the past . i am sure it was not heavily edited so as to ensure i depict our wonderful situation in the best light . newline newline i wanted to thank you for taking the time to write me all those years agoat this very second . it was so nice to find it buried a few inches below the dirt , concealed under the floorboards of the shed you  ve not yet built . unfortunately , as windowless sheds have been deemed illegal by our glorious leader  they are a haven for espionage , since you can  t see in  , i was forced to tear it down andfortunatelyrediscover this wonderful letter just beneath . mary  s was adorable , how she discussed that frozen film in great detail and absolutely nothing else . while i haven  t seen her in a few years , i  m sure she  d be glad to give it a read . unfortunately , she  s at a wonderful camp in farwest pyongyangformerly new yorkand is too busy to write me . i  m sure she  s having a great time playing sports , and doing arts and crafts , and not being tortured , and all the other activities a 29yearold woman loves to do . our glorious leader assures me she  s very happy ! newline newline anyway , i figured it would be polite to write you back . you know , update you on my life and tell you how things are going . they  re great , everything is fantastic . i mean , there were a few years in which things were a bit rough , but now they  re wonderful . i still live in the same house , but it  s no longer located in america . also it is not a house , but rather a tent made out of governmentapproved materials . see , we are now citizens of the democratic people  s republic of west korea , following a briefand incredibly violentwar . that won  t be for another six years , though , so don  t worry about that . newline newline the future is great . our glorious leader has enabled a much better civilization . i read that you  ve still got obama as your socialist dictator . that  s a shame . it was hard under him , being able to go to school and buy food from a supermarket . i can  t even imagine how hard that was . did i mention we have dinosaurs now ? i don  t think so . that  s one of the gifts our glorious leader has brought his citizens . through removing all educational , agricultural , and economical funding , he was able to put all resources into researching and ultimately cloning tyrannosaurus rex , raptors and pterodactyls . it  s great , they  re not an inconvenience at all . honestly , i love having to run for my life every time i leave my shack and go down to the corner market for my ration of bread . super fun . newline newline aside from that , there  s not too much different . dennis rodman is our district representative , and by district i mean all of the former continental united states . while some argue he has absolutely no understanding of global politics , i say he was a great pick to lead our district . a real man  s man , a people pleaser . sure , he made it mandatory for all citizens to have a sleeve of tattoos on either their left or right arm , but i love that . nothing better than seeing infants in tattoo parlors , the artists puffing smoke directly into their newborn faces . it  s great . the future is great . newline newline how are things with you ? still living in wisconsin ? i hope so , it  s great there . seriously great . i know there was a point where i considered moving to canada , to get away from the place that would soon be invaded by north korea , but i  m so glad i didn  t . i  m so glad i stayed at home , lost access to my daughter , had my home torn down and replaced with a tent , and got to live in a country ruled by our glorious leader . i definitely recommend you not ever move away . newline newline anyway , i  d better stop writing now . our glorious leader has enacted a mandatory curfew of 3:30pm , during which time we  re required to go indoors and pray to macho man randy savage . turns out he never actually died , just defected to north korea and became a

with a vibrant hum . i slid down the mask that would cover my face as i unsheathed the sword . i focused on my destination as the blade slashed through the air . a whirling vortex opened , showing a snowy steppe on the other side . i stepped through into the deep powder , and the portal closed behind me . newline newline i am a godkiller . when a god has lost their influence in the mortal realm ,

thunder boomed , and i saw a figure streaking across the sky . i performed a complex series of hand motions , and celestial wings sprouted from the back of my armor . with a mighty swoop , i was airborne and moving towards perkunas at immense speed . as the gap closed , i readied the blade to strike . the blade slashed perkunas in the back , and his formed exploded in a dazzle of lights and sparks . in my daze , another lightning bolt struck me squarely in the back , and drove me to the ground . my armor smoked where the bolt had connected . newline newline i rose to my feet , and saw perkunas hurtling towards me in his chariot . he loosed an extraordinary amount of lightningempowered arrows toward me . i leapt skywards to meet him , deflecting arrows with the sword . as we neared each other , perkunas brought his monstrous axe to bear . a foolish decision . he could never hope to match my speed with such a cumbersome weapon . newline newline as we passed , i felt the blade absorb perkunas  essence as it passed through his body . the chariot and axe disappeared in a cloud of smoke as the storm overhead dissipated .dear jeremy , newline newline we  ve never had the chance

luckily since i was in the botanical gardens there was toilets and drinking taps around rather than just being in the bush where there is nothing . when i was in the toilet i bumped into my best

newline we decided to snort the contents and discovered it was cocaine . we were really high and seeing everything in funky patterns and colours and continued to explore the garden . we bumped into some bitchy girls we hate so we ran into the trees and found some tunnels . we crawled into the tunnels and ended up on the other side of the gardens where there was a huge glasshouse . inside the glasshouse there was huge rainforest trees . it looked like the amazon jungle . it had heaps of huge butterflies flying around that were the size of albatrosses . there were huge flowers the size of cars but also extremely small detailed plants and birds . newline after that we continued to explore and had a fabulous adventure .i have lost everything . newline everything . newline anger builds up in my chest swirling and warming my blood . my chest tightens as my hands clench onto the sides of the sink . even with my eyes closed i can picture all the blood running out of my tense hands as my knuckles fade to white . newline stiffly i move my head up and peek through my eyelids . newline  failure .  newline the sinking feeling in my chest sits heavy as my gaze shifts away , i ca nt bear to look at myself . the image is still staring at me though . the warm feeling spreads from my chest and into all my limbs as i pull back my arm and clench my fist , my untamed nails biting into my flesh , and slam my hand into the mirror trying to kill the image of the smiling man . his lips that were drawn into a sinister smile , now is reduced to a teary eyed mess that has a demon quality with blood oozing down the shattered image . newline i feel my body give up , as my legs buckle and my chin catches the end of the sink on my way down . a searing pain explodes as a distinct metal taste fills my mouth . what is the point of this ? newline  maybe i should give up .  newline my burmese python slithers into the room , her pale scales appeared to illuminate with the small amount of light the ceiling lamp gives off . she starts to curl herself around my body coming to meet me in the eyes . newline  so what should i do ?  newline as if she were responding she wraps her smooth body around my neck and pulls herself tighter and tighter , as she agrees with every thought that passed through my head moments before . i know what she is doing , and i m not stopping her . newline she finally reaches the point to where my breathe is caught in my throat and only instinct causes my hands to fly up and try to pull her away . even as my vision starts to gain black dots that are moving and multiplying . more and more appear until finally the world makes it s decent into darkness .hundreds of people pass by her every day . they stand in great gelatinous blobs , moving and breathing as a single organism to gaze at her through their thousanddollar telephoto lenses , then go to the gift shop and buy her likeness on mugs and mousepads . newline newline  i saw the mona lisa !  they crow on facebook . they instagram her image , with a vintage filter , then buy a pain au chocolat . they sip their espresso and talk about how transcendent the experience was , how everyone should stand before her and bask in her enigmatic gaze . they elbow through the crowds on their way to la tour eiffel , where they buy their cheap trinkets , these shallow tourists . newline newline but i have waked alongside her , the eternal silent creature , for many nights , under the low hum of the security lights . together we keep our watch over the galleries and corridors . she shines quietly in the pool of reflected light that spills in front of her , she gazes as she has always gazed . the teeming mass can not understand her as i understand her . they do not contemplate  they commit acts of driveby art consumption , then rush off to see the madonna of the rocks to see if dan brown described it right . i despise that fool . newline newline but in the night , when the galleries lie in semidarkness , i am alone with the joconde . the daytime groupies who see the world through the cameras of their smartphones do not stop to ask why she looks so , what days she has seen , what has made her wistful and knowing . their failure is in their rush  there is no depth or knowledge in their viewing . newline newline but i know . newline newline in the dimness she whispers her secrets for my ears to hear , and tells me of the land where she was made . the hand that painted her was gentle and wise , and the knowledge that was imparted by it is for all the ages . she whispers to me her love of him that breathed mystery into her . it was not only in his art that he loved her , and laid her bare , and knew her . her face speaks her secrets to those who listen , but these days i am the only one who has ears to hear . when i stroke her oaken cheek , i know that she understands me , and i her . once i was privy to such a mystery  once i loved as she has loved . once my soul was laid on to the pristine stretch of a canvas and i was made both old and new by it . newline newline once , i , too , knew a painter .i pulled up my book , squinting to read the spell better . i could nt mess this up again . i had to become the best quickly , or die trying . newline newline the summoning spell was supposed to be beginner level , but this felt harder than anything i had ever done before , including raising the dead . and this time , i was under more pressure to get this done quickly , before he arrived . my speed would be the difference between life and death . newline newline fear was getting the best of me , and i knew that panic would cause errors that i could nt afford to make . i cleared my throat , set my book down on the ground , and took a deep breath in . newline newline  breathe , salene . breathe . you can do this .  i closed my eyes tightly .  you can do this . you can do this . you will do this !  i opened my eyes , feeling invigorated . i knew i could do this . newline newline i picked my book back up , picking up the human skull lying next to it as well . i squeezed the skull lightly for luck , then held it over my head . newline newline  otkin adarab utaalk !  i roared , confident that this time would be a success .  otkin adarab utaalk !  i could feel the power coursing through me , and the skull felt hot in my hand .  otkin ad ...  newline newline a noise behind me cut me off . i whipped around to come face to face with him . or what i thought was him . newline newline before me stood a weak looking young man . he was sickly thin , wearing armor that looked frail and not at all what you would expect from a hero . his dirty hair was matted to his forehead with sweat , and his expression did nt look confident . in fact , he looked scared . newline newline i put the skull down to my side , and stared at him , waiting for him to say or do something . he did nothing and just stared at me too . i did nt know what to do . newline newline  ahem i ve ... i ve been exp ... pecting you .  i stuttered , feeling a lump swell in my throat . i did nt want to do this . i did nt want to have to fight this man , and i certainly did nt want to have to kill him . but i knew that if i did nt fight , he would kill me . newline newline he simply nodded his head and glanced down at the short dagger hanging at his side . he grimaced , and pulled it out of his sheath . it was at that moment that i knew what i was dealing with . newline newline i had been expecting a fierce hero , someone who would barge in with a massive sword and start the fight without a word . i expected a hero from the stories , a witch slayer who would take my head back to his village triumphantly , being celebrated and admired . instead , i got a teenager , someone who had probably not seen many battles . someone who had very little confidence , very little skill . i had gotten someone who was a beginner , just like my self . i felt guilt and pity , but i no longer felt fear . newline newline  i m sorry i have to do this to you .  he said quietly , not much louder than a whisper . newline newline  i m sorry i have to do this too .  i frowned , then i raised the skull back over my head , preparing the summoning spell again .i remember when this was fun . when triumph filled me with pride , a battle hard fought  now it fills me with little more than self loathing and pity for the fools . gavarenth the mighty , they called me . and the tyrant , and the nightmare , and the dire , and countless others titles . they all kind of ran together after the years , if i was to be honest . for 300 hundred years i guarded my hoard , one of the few of my people still holding to the old ways . other dragons fell in time , jeventh trapped under a rockslide , feranth felled by clerenbald the bold , and cithyth ? after her clutch of eggs were destroyed by people from the nearby villages , she flew there , racked with grief . she barely defended herself as they skewered her with their meager pitchforks . newline newline i held fast to my hoard , killing any knights who would try to claim the riches i had amassed . they tried in vain , as i add their meager valuable to the pile . i looked fondly on the sword and shield of the first knight i ever fought , lambelin the terrible . a brute of a man , a true monster , he came the closest to killing me out of any of them . none of the others compared to him , they seemed to be getting more and more feeble as time went on . newline newline i was padding my way around the hoard when i heard the telltale sound of the clopping of hooves . the last knight seemed to convinced that his squire clopping odd fruits together meant he had a horse . python , i think he claimed to be from . but this time around , it seemed to be an actual horse , this time . i sighed and walked to the mouth of the cave . newline newline the knight before me looked much like an onion of sorts , his sword , if it could even be called that , was needle thin . he brandished it with reckless abandon , shouting all the while as he approached me . newline newline  foul demon , i am sieg   newline newline he did nt finish the sentence . he tripped over a root or maybe his feet . i stood there for a few moments watching the blood pool into the earth . this really used to have purpose . i d get him later .i waited silently in the car for brit , his wife , to make her morning exit for work . she was running late , which meant that he would be , too . they only had one bathroom and her work as a firstyear associate was far more important to her than his final year of law school . newline newline i watch brit drive to the end of macon and take a left on whitten toward 40 . she was late enough at this point that if she had forgotten something at home , she d have no time to come back and get it . newline newline after the car was out of sight , i worked myself into as emotional a state as i could and made my way to hud s front door . i knocked hard , three times . newline newline  i m coming , i m coming christ , what did you forget this   . he swung the door open and was surprised to see me standing there , looking a wreck .  what the hell s going on , man ? are you alright ? you look like someone just killed your mom something .  newline newline we had nt talked in over a month . unbeknownst to his wife , hud had had an affair with mine . newline  newline it was nt a long or involved process . the two had gotten drunk one night when we were all watching basketball . earlier in the evening , one my of clients had been picked up for assaulting a cop during a narcotics bust and i got en emergency call to sit in on questioning . by the time i got to the precinct , he d manage to wrestle one of the detective s service weapons away from him and kill himself . there was nothing left for me to do  at least not for the night  so i went back home . newline newline i caught hud in the kitchen with mel , on the table , fucking like rabbits . the looks on their faces when they saw held regret , astonishment , embarrassment ... mortification , even , but the damage was done . hud tried to give a  sorry , bro  hug but i pushed him off and he made it to his car where he slept off the booze til morning . newline  newline the affair was nt what had gotten to me , though . newline newline i had always been the responsible one in our friendship . i had always put my nose to the grindstone , studied rigorously , and earned my way through undergrad and law school . i had submitted numerous papers for publication and esteemed peer review , but nothing had ever been published and i had never gotten any acclaim . but more than anything , i worked , and i worked hard . newline newline hud had always been irresponsible with money and came to me numerous times asking for help . i gave him what i could , within reason  enough to help a friend out but not enough to make money an issue . newline newline hard work and wise investment had seen my assets grow over the past five years . when was just about to make a large lump payment to rid myself of all educational debt , i received the worst punch to the gut that i had ever gotten before . all my money was gone . someone had been taking it out of my bank account  500 at a time , once a week , for months . and it was gone . i put two and two together . newline newline hud and brit s new car . no mention of financial stress in months . no more talk of being foreclosed on . that piece of shit stole money , my money , to help himself . i had planned to make him pay . screwing my wife was simply the tipping point . newline  newline  it s lucky , man , he died this morning .  i was barely able to get the words out through my fake grief , and hud bought it . newline newline lucky  officially lucius beauregard prefontaine iv  was my thirteen yearold scottish terrier . my with parents  permission , hud and his family had given lucky to me as a present on my 14th birthday and we had been nearly inseparable through high school . during undergrad , we got special permission to live in an apartment our freshman year so that lucky would nt have to stay behind with our parents in jackson . newline newline though lucky had died , i was purposefully vague about the circumstances . i had taken lucky to the vet countless times over the past year and he was on his way out as it was . the night before , he had an unfortunate encounter with porcupine and broke his hip while trying to evade the critter . thinking of how much he would have to suffer and how expensive it would be  and simultaneously remember all of the good times we had had together when hud , that traitorous bastard , was in the fold  i had figured that this was a better time than any to make my peace with his departure . i had taken him into the garage and left the car running while he slept . it was peaceful , but it was nt natural . newline newline  shit , man , i m sorry . are you okay ?  newline newline  yeah , he died in his sleep last night . i know we have nt talked in a month , but i was hoping  for old time s sake , that you d come with to bury him in his woods and pay our last respects  . lucky loved to roam the 5 acre woods behind my house . newline newline  shit . i ve got a really important seminar today at ...  his words trailed off as i willed the hurt in my eyes to include disappointment and to increase in gravity .  yeah man , let me just call my professor .  newline newline  you need to call brit , too ?  newline newline  i ll call her later . her boss has been a real prick about cell phones at work lately , i ll call her at lunch at let her know .  newline  newline the drive from memphis to lexington take about ninety minutes , give or take . after picking up lucky from home , i took the circuitous route out of the city to perplex anyone who might wonder where we had been heading . about 10 minutes out of the city hud , like clockwork , had to stop for a leak . since becoming a coffee drinker , he begun a daily routine of taking a piss exactly half an hour after every cup . newline newline i pulled off the highway into pulloff area next to a berm and hud went over to the other side to piss . while he was gone , i quickly removed the sim card from his phone and replaced the battery with a dead one . newline newline he got back in and we continued toward lexington . it took about 45 more minutes to realize his phone was off . once i reassured him that i was nt being a dick and messing with his phone , he concluded that he must have forgotten to charge his phone and told me to remind him to plug it in when we got to my parents house . newline  newline i pulled into the driveway and opened the garage . both of my parents were at work and would be gone for at least another 5 hours . hud plugged his phone into the wall socket where my dad charges his tools . we grabbed two shovels and headed out the back door of the garage toward the woods . newline newline my parents have neighbors , but the area is relatively sparse in terms of population . the closest neighbors to the left of my parents lived at least 1000 yards away and would nt see anything , while the closest ones on the right  closer by proximity  only lived in that particular house for a few weeks out of the year . newline newline we walked for about twenty minutes before reaching our old camping spot . we d spend many nights here as teenagers , with lucky in tow , and this was as good a place as any to bury him . newline newline mastiffs are big dogs , so i figured 4 feet should do the trick . after i hit about the four foot mark , i just kept on going  harder , faster , til my muscles burned and tears were streaming down my face . it took a lot of focus to conjure up every sad mental image i could , but i did . hud yelled for me to stop , that i had gone far enough , but i was upset . after he finally got into the hole and put his arms firmly on my shoulders , i stopped long enough to hear him console me , and i stopped . hud hopped up reached a hand down to help me out . the work gloves made the grip less than secure , but he managed to hold on . i asked him to help me retrieve lucky from the tarp . newline newline as he bent over , i thrust my steeltoed boot upward , with force , knocking him unconscious . i crouched down behind him and wrapped my forearm around his neck , pulling him firmly toward me . my grip tightened cutting of circulation to his brain . i counted thirty seconds  you only need ten  as his face turned blue and any fight that he may have had left in him drifted away . newline newline i rolled his body into the hole along with my work gloves . i dumped about three feet of soil on top of his dead body and packed it down as firmly as i could . then i climbed out of the hole , and rested lucky s body on the top layer of dirt . i then filled in the hole and place an oak grave marker on the spot with lucky s information on it . newline  newline on the way back to my car , i grabbed hud s phone and cable from the workbench and tossed them in the car . newline newline i made the 90 minute drive back to memphis in silence and paranoia . every stop light , every siren , every thing i heard or saw that disrupted the continuous motion of the car made me certain that the police were on their way to arrest me . newline newline at around ten minutes outside the city , i made a uturn and pulled into the same emergency pulloff area that we had been to five hours before . i put the factory battery and sim card back into the device an vigorously wiped my fingerprints from it . i tossed it over the berm , made another uturn , then went home . newline newline though i ve been twice questioned about his disappearance thanks to my wife s admission of her indiscretion , the police stopped short of making me a suspect and have never solved the mystery of hudson prentiss s disappearance . newline wow , such luck . in the second world , most babies are born as viscous sacks of disease and pestilence , half of the world is dedicated to them . they do nt need much , their bodies only needing the sustenance needed by prokaryotes . newline newline anyone not killed by disease occupies the high positions , the political leaders , the ceo s , the people of power . governing the aids , the cancers , the malarias , all of the infections is all we need to do . newline newline and then there s me . i ca nt die ! no matter how hard i m hit , i always bounce back . i can store enough liquid to hydrate a small town , and i can hit harder than a truck . this is the life . the only better way to die would be to be thrown into the sun . but that s dreaming .kelazhur walked into nasa , newline wishing he could play masa . newline looked around the place , newline saw his desk space . newline walked up to the pc , newline found the program easy . newline flew to mars and back , newline gasless with no rack . newline newline across the table was tlo , newline last wcs was a nogo . newline machines were not his strong suit , newline being a zerg made them moot . newline regardless he tried , newline but eventually he cried . newline it was nt the same , newline without his drones in the game . newline newline who rounds out the trio ? newline that is the protoss lilbow . newline without pylons to build , newline his orders were easily filled . newline he built actual stalkers , newline far better than walkers . newline annoying to think , newline that they could be gone in a blink . yes ?  the nurse said , preparing the injection that legally activated my superpowers . she was looking away from me . newline newline the reason she was looking away was because of my irises within my eyes  they were the color of the forest sky in the deepest night . i d been born with these eyes , and they unsettled everyone . i spoke softly , though with the bottled rage from the torment of high school lurking behind the words .  does noone know what is coming for me ?  newline newline the nurse reflexively shook her head .  almost there now ,  she said to me , back turned . she was using her power to fill up the needle point , and gently pushed the solution through the needle .  you ll feel a sharp scratch followed by a cold burning sensation in your arm . this is normal .  newline newline i did feel a sharp scratch . i did feel a cold burning sensation . newline newline i didnt expect an immediate reaction to the solution . newline newline i could see ... things . things both living and dead .  how many people have you lost , nurse ?  i blurted out without thinking . i guess i was lucky she d already pulled the needle out , because she startled and whirled round to face me . newline newline her face mottled with pure anger , offended by my question . i watched , fascinated as the chains of lfie and death whirled through her body , like a chain reaction .  how dare you ask such a question ?  rage turned her voice into a scarred and scared mask . newline newline i put my hands up , stalling her .  i m sorry . it s just that ... there are fifteen shadows watching over you . i think five of them are dead , and ten of them are ... other . i ca nt explain it any other way .  the nurse frowned , and the confusion spread through her . i could see her thoughts as though it was as clear as glass . how could she possibly know ... ?  newline newline ... i guess i should stay away from everyone for a while . everybody get the f on the ground  newline oh shit ... i thought , this is a stick up ! four men strode in through the door wearing trench coats black as night . masks covered their face , weapons concealed behind the coats . they strode down the aisle , with their guns poking behind the black coats . a thought passed my mind  my god , it looks like all four of them have massive erections ... a slight laugh protruded from my lips . newline  who the f said that , we said shut up !  newline shit , i once again thought , that almost got me killed ... newline or did it . i examined the situation again . i never did see actual guns . only assumed they had them . matter of fact , why conceal them . it made no sense , what was the benefit . a brief flow of heroism flooded through me as i pictured my face on the cover of new york times . i stood up and yelled  they do nt even have ...  newline the nearest man in black whipped around , ripped back one flap of his trench coat , reveled a revolver and pumped 3 shots into my chest ... newline newline fuck i ve never been more wrong .when i was boy , father spoke to me of monsters . he say , legend born of truth and twisted by time still true . he warned me of darker hills in romania , darker hills with black wood . i was never to go to them . not as boy . not as man . not ever . man has not conquered world like he thinks .  newline newline he was right . newline newline in village , stories can not always be trusted . they are halffun . like television . villagers embellish for entertainment . they can not help . they are bored . but sometimes you hear story , and you know it true . even when heart not want to believe , you know . newline newline i was fool . newline newline i hope my father forgive me even though he is dead . i hope my family forgive me , although they shouldn  t . no one should . newline newline when first report come , we think it joke . the man was crazy . he shivered like so much cold but covered in sweat . he ran all night down road , through mud , through ice and rain . when inside garrison , he collapsed . his strength was gone , but his eyes still wild , and he spoke crazy things . newline newline they  ve come ! they  ve come !  he said , again and again . but when we ask who , he go crazy . the darkness with eyes , he say . the darkness with eyes .  newline newline so , we go . what else is do ? is job . we go . newline newline i  ve never seen so much blood . newline newline the village was gone . in mud , you could see the marks where villager claw ground while being dragged from home . all homes like this . all villager is gone . taken up the hill and into wood . every trail the same , washed in blood . and in one small home i see crib . itlike meat pile . like smashed tomato . newline newline i remember gun shaking in hand and feeling very cold even though in full uniform . mist come from woods and cover village in sadness . the others , they say devil . some say demon . but i remember my father  s words of black wood . newline newline village was too close . newline newline while staring at crib , shaking , crying , i hear shot and yell . i run from small home to see fellow soldier being killed by wolf of shadow . wolf of shadow does not eat soldier like wolf . wolf of shadow eats soldier like darkness eat room of dying candle . wolf of shadow surrounds and soldier becomes another meat pile and puddle of blood . newline newline so i run . newline newline i know it  s too late , and i know i am soldier and supposed to fight , but i can not help . i run . newline newline there is clearing in wood , on hill , outside of village . the trees have been lumbered and thatch harvested for village . when running , i see wolf of shadow , whole pack now . they are in the wood beyond . i see what crazy man saw now . the darkness with eyes . newline newline though i tremble with fear , i can not go on . is hopeless . man can not outrun legend . i fall to my knees and weep like child , for i am scared and suddenly very homesick . i hear wolf of shadow coming to me and i pray that end is fast . i do not fear death , but i do not wish dying to be painful . newline newline but then strange silence falls around me . i look and see that wolf of shadow has moved away . newline newline there is woman now . is gypsy in red . with her is real wolf , black but not as shadow although the eyes look same . i try to gather myself and stand . maybe gypsy can save me . maybe she commands wolf of shadow . newline newline  what are you doing , gypsy ?  i ask . i hold my rifle but i do not point it at her or real wolf . in her hand , she holds a stiletto dagger . newline newline she does not answer . newline newline  why have you unleashed these evil things ?  i ask . behind her , pack of wolf of shadow stand now like human things . they are taller than tallest man i have seen . they are tall like bear . newline newline  are you devil ?  i ask in whisper . the wolves of shadow laugh . the sound is like jackal . newline newline the gypsy looks upon me with eyes like shadow , like skin of wolf of shadow . she points dagger at me and tells me to kneel . i can barely stand already . my knees are shaking . but with all of heart , i do not want to kneel . my father spoke of other things when i was boy as well . newline newline son , he said , never kneel for devil , for then death is not the end . newline newline the gypsy takes halfstep closer . her voice is different now . is voice of devil . gypsy tells me to kneel . in heart , i feel nothing but sorrow and dread . i wish to be home . around me , the wolves of shadow laugh like jackal . newline newline my leg bends .motherfucker . not again . newline newline i guess i should explain . greatgramps apparently had it , but i never heard much about him . some kind of rumour about the russian royalty and a scandal , but nothing definite . gramps had it , and it was bad , during the war . nazis and shit . dad had it too , and in the seventies it almost got him killed , more than once . but the stories he told , and the seventies being the tail end of free love and burn the bras , well , it coulda been worse . i guess . shit , those daisy duke shorts and all . man , i could deal with that . the women never get it , just the men . christ on a stick , for all the bitching they do and they never once have to deal with this kind of crap . nobody knows when it started for us , but from what i can piece together , it s been a long , long time . newline newline dad calls them the freeloaders , and i guess that s about as good a name as any . always winds up costing me , and i do nt get shit out of it . gas money , repairs  and you think i can get insurance anymore ? not my fault , but those bastards just do nt know how to deal with this . too much outofthebox thinking for them , i guess . been through six windshields in the past two years . and if i have to talk to that fatass detective from central one more time , and listen to him chew me out for some bullshit , i swear to god . newline newline but you get used to it . you have to . there s a sort of helplessness you feel , and you just have to accept it . i ve been meditating for a couple years now , and it helps me to accept the world for what it is . not that it s all sunshine and roses , but it takes the edge off . newline newline she actually cracked my window with the baby bottle . i did nt know they still made the glass ones  i just assumed they were all plastic these days . so right away i pegged her as either rich , or one of these organic bpafree bitches who are always posting on facebook about some environmental scandal or some crap . interspersed with nonstop picture of their vegan , antibioticfree quinoa burgers . i rolled my eyes . rich i could work with . vegan , well , i slept with a vegan girl once , and she was high maintenance . i mean severely high , get me the hell out of here , high maintenance . the fuck was hardly worth it , but at least she was flexible . all that yoga . and shaved clean as a baby . oh yeah . but i digress . newline newline i had to stop anyway , since her idiot friend was right in front of me , flailing her arms around , shouting  stop ! ! !  . as much as i wanted to pretend the brakes were a little soft , and i could nt avoid it , a little part of me knew i should stop . i m in the habit of getting the car serviced right ready these days . part of accepting the whole deal . top running order . it s nothing special , just a piece of shit mazda , and more than a few years old . but you think i want to be racing down yonge street with a crackedout stripper in the back seat , shouting at me in romanian while brandishing a glock , and having the engine misfiring and revmaxing again ? fuck that shit nine ways to sunday . newline newline so i hit the brakes , and with a sigh , hit the door locks open . the bitch jumps in the back seat . i kind of twist around to check out her ass , and she s surprisingly skinny for someone carrying a baby bottle . tight little red flannelly shorts . i could work with those legs . she yells at her friend to get in , and grabs my shoulder .  follow that cab ! he s got my baby ! you know those scenes in action movies where the main character is all tied up on a chair blindfolded and it s pitch black everywhere ? well , yeah . that s my situation right about now . the only difference is : i m no action star . newline newline flick . a light bulb above me just turned on . i ca nt see it , but i feel its brightness . and not only that ... i can feel something move . footsteps . definitely footsteps . newline newline  well , good evening mr . thompson .  a voice that now seems to be right in front of me said in a husky tone that just screams evil villainmastermind . newline newline he took off my blindfold and  jeez louise ! he s not a he ! it s a womana really big woman , probably the size of a hippo .  it looks like you re coming to your senses now , hm ?  newline newline  wha  what do you want from me ?  i replied , all dazed and confused .  why am i all tied up ? ! what is all of this ? ! ? !  newline newline  ah , you see . we need your help , mr. dwayne thompson .  she said in an even huskier voice as she presented me with a package wrapped in tin foil and placed it on my lap . newline newline  the fate of the world is in your hands .  she continued , her ugly and smelly henchmen now untying me from the chair i was seated on ,  eat this burger in five days , or the world will explode !  newline newline with my hands finally free , i picked up the wrapped package and smelled it . i m telling you man , it smelled good .  uh , yeah . is this some kind of joke ? am i on one of those prank shows on tv ? because i do nt really like those .  newline newline the hippo lady just laughed . newline newline  uh ... okay ? bye .  newline newline and a snap as i tried to stand up from the chair , dropping the tinfoiled burger on the floor . from out of nowhere , i got electrocuted violently . i felt the shock from head to toe . newline newline      ! what the heck was that ? !  newline newline  do nt you even dare try getting away from this one mr. thompson ! we are serious ! we are cruel ! we are dangerous !  the woman exclaimed .  now take this burger , and eat it !  newline newline she picked up the burger from the floor , with much difficulty of course , courtesy of that big belly of hers , and shoved it on my chest . i took the thing once again and raised an eyebrow at her . newline newline  jeez louise , mcdonalds . if you want me to try your new burger , you could just ask .  newline newline  do you think we are kidding here , mr . thompson ?  newline newline  whatever , i hope i get a free sundae after this   newline newline  we are not kidding .  she stared down at me with a really intimidating facea face worse than all the other hippos i ve seen at the zoo .  do you want me to show you how serious i am ?  she flicked her fingers and commanded ,  guards .  newline newline the henchmen went away and came back with a tablet . newline newline  watch closely , boy .  newline newline and so i did watch closely . my eyes widened as i saw the footage . it was a house being blown up to bits ... and it was nt just any house .  you horrible piece of     that doghouse cost me a fortune ! what did you do to my dog ? ! what did you do to my ziggy huh ? !  newline newline  oh i assure you the dog is very much dead , dwayne . gone . done for ... and that was only the beginning . next ... is the world !  newline newline  you sick     ! why i   zap . she electrocuted me again . newline newline  i repeat , mr. thompson . the rules are simple . eat this burger in five days , or the world will explode .  newline newline  fine ! let s get this over with .  i told her as i unwrapped the thing .  what in the flying     is with this burger   my eyes widened again as i saw what was inside .  you really are one messed up little witch .  newline newline i took the burger out of the wrapper and examined it . it was actually fine , honestly . a thick patty , some nice buns , some crispylooking lettuce pieces , and some tomatoes , plus some ham too . but the only problem with it was ... newline newline  it has cheese . how did you know i hated cheese ? ! you freaking hippo .  newline newline  what did you just call me ?  newline newline  the cheese is all over the place . this is horrible !  newline newline  you have to eat it ... or the world will go poof .  she told me with a sadistic smile . i never knew hippos could muster up a smile that sadistic . newline newline  in five days ? hm . just watch . i ll finish this up in five minutes . then i ll throw it all up on your stupid hippo face .  newline newline and so i began eating . it was the most disgusting eating experience i have ever had in my entire life . all the evil laughing the hippo lady did through it all made it even more gross . i could feel the cheese linger in my teeth , and it was just plain nasty . the horror , man . the horror . newline newline  gah ! i m  i m done .  i said , as i took the last bite . newline newline  ha ha ha ! you did well , mr. thompson . much better than i expected .  newline newline  okay , now let me out of here , you psycho . i m done with your garbage .  newline newline  but i ll have to blow up the world anyway .  newline newline  what ? ! are you insane ? ! ? ! i just finished that burger for you ! that horrible , stinking piece of trash of a burger with cheese in it ! ! !  newline newline  my instructions were clear , dwayne .  newline newline  it was     clear , hippo ! you said i had to eat it in five days , and guess what ? i finished that crap in 5 freaking minutes .  newline newline  i said in five days , mr. thompson . in five days . inside the five days  restaurant ! ha ha ha ! you have been a resident in this city for so long now , i thought you d know that joint .  newline newline  well how was i supposed to eat it there if you kept me on this chair all this time ? !  newline newline  we re done here . you have failed . say goodbye to the world now .  newline newline  no ! ! !  newline newline and the woman clicked a button , and i heard a huge explosion . i closed my eyes and ... no . i did nt see my life flash before my eyes , like how the action stars do . like i said : i m no action star . newline newline i opened my eyes again after a brief moment of fear , and looked around . the hippo lady was laughing hysterically , as her evil plan succeeded  but wait . i do nt get it ,  i thought you d make the world explode ?  newline newline  and yes i did ! i did blow up the world ! ha ha ha !  she looked into my eyes with such evil intent and whispered ,  the world cafe . all of us thankful . newline newline all of us bow . newline newline all of us call to our mighty man on high . newline newline in days ago , long , past , abyss , our words did not honor . newline newline our words had pockmarks with an odor unholy . newline newline work did start at a command to sanctify . newline newline newline words of past to sift and omit . newline newline newline a viral mark stooping about , pawing through stories , thoughts , history , songs , shouts , claims , journals , prancing about with claws around our throats and books . newline newline words would sink in its fluctuating pronunciation , no warrior fit to fight this profanity . newline newline full of tricks , lurking in shadows , turning off its sound at will , hunting with no signs of stopping newline newline infiltrating with a smooth oozing grin newline newline gnawing voraciously at unwilling words  conclusions newline newline all purity of communication lost in a bloating linguistic bog of filth newline newline sing with us of victory from the grasp of such a mark . newline newline sing with us of mighty man on high newline newline our warrior of wisdom and a way with words newline newline away with words unworthy of this newline newline all of us thankful . newline newline all of us bow .martin slammed his empty glass down on the table and signaled to the bartender for another one . at the lampshade bar where the genies could gather and share their stories , and maybe even wake up in another lamp , martin was on the verge of being blackout drunk . newline newline  hey man , take it easy . that s your seventh one , alright ?  alan spoke in a cautious voice . newline newline  sshu , just shut up , ok ? you do nt fucking know the shit i ve seen .  martin slurred as the bartender slid him his eighth beer of the day . he could barely even lift the drink to his mouth before dropping it .  motherfucker ...  he muttered as the liquid spilled from the counter onto his lap , although the bottle fortunately remained unbroken . newline newline but alan did know what martin had seen . he told the same story every time he got like this . he d drink too much , tell the tale of woe , cry , pass out , and wake up the next morning acting like nothing had happened . but alan had heard the story so many times that he could practically tell every word martin was going to say before he even said it . newline newline  all the kid wanted was for his music to be heard . he just wanted people to stop and listen to him . i should ve known it would get to his head , but i granted it anyway . i had to , after all .  martin stopped the story to take a sip from his drink , forgetting that he had spilt it . no matter how drunk he got , martin always sounded stonecold sober whenever he told this story .  martin , you do nt have to tell this story a  alan tried to comfort martin but found himself being ignored as martin opened his mouth to speak again . newline newline  he was a sweet kid , he really was . his voice was nt halfbad either . but all the women , all the drugs , it just ... it just got to him . why did nt i try to protect him ? why did nt i warn him ?  martin spoke with tears beginning to run down his cheeks . alan placed a hand on his shoulder  martin , you could nt have know that would happen .  newline newline  shut up !  yelled martin in a burst of anger .  you do nt know what it s like to mess with fate like that ! you do nt know what it s like to fuck with the world like i did !  the tears flowed uncontrollably down martin s face as his yelling voice nearly cracked .  i can never forgive myself for bringing justin bieber into this world ! never !  he yelled , standing up to walk before collapsing , having passed out again . newline newline alan sighed as he dragged martin outside to the cab as he had so many times before .  you re right , man ...  alan muttered .  all i ever did was grant hitler power over germany . when you ve lived a life like mine , little can truly surprise you anymore . in my thirtyfive years i d done just about all there was to do on this earth . i d seen wonders , met people , traveled the globe , fallen in love , had my heart broken , felt more than most people feel in seventy years  worth of time . i d been on top of the world and to the depths of hell and back . so when death first appeared to me i did nt act surprised . newline newline it was an eerie feeling at first , when i noticed him sitting there in that rocking chair at the foot of my sickbed , but it settled quickly . to some , he undoubtedly appeared different  a hooded black figure to those who feared him , perhaps . but it had been ages since i had felt anything at all , let alone fear . no , the figure in front of me was rather unassuming : a fiftysomething year old man , a full head of light brown hair , laugh lines on his face , a corduroy jacket over his sweater . he could have been a bona fide college professor , sitting there turning the pages of that thick red book in his lap . but it did nt take me long to figure out what he was . i had been expecting him for some time now , really . newline newline  good evening , mister warren . seen better days , eh ?  newline newline his voice and his expression were warm . i could tell he knew me . perhaps he noticed the liquor bottle and innumerous medications on the nightstand , perhaps it was the hacking cough , or perhaps he needed only stare into my eyes to see that i would nt be putting up a fight . whatever the case , i had nt risen in weeks , and i was nt going anywhere now . newline newline and so , we talked . we talked about my life , about my parents and my childhood and my first time holding a violin . about the prodigy who wrote symphonies by age thirteen and who was a worldwide sensation by sixteen , to whom music came as quickly and as naturally as drawing breath . about private schools and concert halls and television specials . about the boy who had the world in his hands that was so lost from me now . newline newline and we talked about ellen . oh god , how we talked about ellen . about the stiffness in my legs and stutter in my voice the first time i saw her , about our first kiss , about the tears i shed when she walked down the aisle towards me in that white dress , about how she became my world and inspired me . about the pain that comes with losing a child and a wife who could never look at you with the same love again . about the pain of watching someone you loved walk out the door for the last time . about the day i got that call about that accident , and how music had left me and never returned ever since . newline newline all throughout he maintained that warm smile , but he kept his eyes on the pages in front of him , occasionally laughing and flipping through . newline newline  what was it like , getting to create the soundtrack on a spielberg movie ?  newline newline  what did you do with all that money , at such an age ?  newline newline  of all things , you gave her a little bracelet on your first date ? how did that go over ?  newline newline  did you really once tell the director of the chicago orchestra that beethoven had a better ear for pitch than he did , at the end of his days ?  newline newline it continued for what felt like hours . sometimes it was enjoyable , sometimes painful . several times i even faked a smile . other times i asked him rather bluntly if we could just get on with business . but then finally , as he turned another page , something managed to peak my curiosity . newline newline  what is that , anyway ?  i asked him , pointing at the red , leatherbound book . newline newline he looked up at me , laughing as he gave me a slightly incredulous look . newline newline  why , it s your book , of course !  newline newline  but i ve never written ...  newline newline  sure you have !  he said reassuringly .  you ve been writing it your whole life . here , would you like to see ?  he walked over and held it out to me . newline newline i flipped it over as i took it in my hands . it was old , and heavier than it had any right to be . j.s . warren was all it read on the cover . my hair stood on end as i flipped the first page , and then another , and another . it was ... me . my entire life , in print , like an awkwardlynarrated autobiography . there were passages in here from parts of my life that i had discussed with the man who was death only minutes ago , but there were also details that i had never told anyone  some thoughts i had never even spoken aloud . it was all there . newline newline eventually i came to the details of the first time i met ellen  that was when i had had enough . i let the book fall to the bed and pushed it away . newline newline  that s enough ,  i said ,  if you re through torturing me i d like to get on with this .  newline newline  are you ?  he asked curiously . i could feel his eyes on me , even though i averted his gaze .  i never was a fan of these ... situations . your book need not end in such a way .  newline newline that upset me . i met his eyes and stared back at him , defiant . i did nt say anything  i did nt have to . i wanted it to all end . i wanted to vanish . i wanted to be rid of the pain . and i did not want his pity . he nodded . newline newline  very well then .  he leaned forward , slowly reaching a finger out to touch my forehead . i closed my eyes , waiting for it to take me . newline newline but then he stopped .  oh ,  he said , fumbling for something in his pocket .  i m sorry , i know you re in a hurry , but i just had one thing to show you first .  newline newline i gave him an exasperated look as he placed it in my hand . i did nt want to look at it , but i could feel it was small and metallic . a shiver went through my body . this was something i had held before . i looked down , and for the first time since i could remember , tears came to my eyes . newline newline it was brass . small , with two little musical notes etched into the design in the center . it was cracked , worn , and barely held together , but i knew exactly what it was . it was a bracelet . a bracelet that a promising young musician had once given his future wife on their very first date . newline newline  where did you get this ?  i was barely able to ask as my throat choked up . newline newline  they never found it in the wreckage , but she had with her the night of the accident ,  he said sadly . newline newline suddenly i felt bombarded . anger , sadness , bewilderment  things i did nt think i would ever have felt again . my face flushed . it was nt possible , it could nt have been . she had left me . she d never wanted to see me again . how could she or anyone else have ever loved me ?  i could nt even get a thought out as i looked up at him . newline newline  but , i thought ... she did nt ... she could nt have kept ...  newline newline he silenced me , placing a hand on my head and looking straight into my eyes . newline newline  she never went anywhere without that bracelet . never . after all those years . now i do nt know what you ve been lead to believe , but it seems obvious to me that it  and whomever gave it to her  must have meant quite a lot .  newline newline and then the levee broke . i burst into tears . after all those years . i squeezed the tarnished remnants of that bracelet so hard that my hand bled . somewhere inside me , i felt something else . like a shackle loosening itself . little by little , the pain slowly left me . i could picture ellen smiling in front of me again . a warmth seemed to spread through me as i sat up . but there was something else , something inside my head that i thought i would never hear again . music . newline newline i looked up at the man who was death again . his gaze was expectant . newline newline  and now ?  he said gently . newline newline slowly , i stood up . it was like my body was remembering how to move again . i smiled at him as i righted myself , and shook my head . i must have looked an awful wreck , but truthfully i do nt think i had ever felt so alive . i could move . i could feel . i wanted to live again . i do nt know where it was coming from , but i felt ready for the world again . and most of all i wanted my violin again . newline newline i wanted to thank the man in front of me , i wanted to ask how i could ever repay this debt i owed him , but something about him told me i had said enough . he simply nodded , picked up the book , and turned for the door . newline newline  this is quite a story , mister warren ,  he said , tucking the book away under his robe ,  and i look forward to the day i might read the rest of it . in a time very different from ours , there was a community of small villages . these villages lived under the shadow of a large mountain , surviving off of the cool , refreshing spring water that flowed from the mountain peak . newline newline one fateful day a large shadow was cast upon the mountain , fire erupted from the shadow and shook the mountain to its core .  this mountain is mine and the people my slaves from this day forth until the end of your days !  rang out a deep and thunderous voice from atop the high peak . newline newline no one could see who this voice belonged to , but it was assumed it must have been a dragon . after that day the once cold streams ran hot and boiled so no one could bathe , drink , or enjoy thier life source . newline newline the community leaders joined together one day and decided they would hire the most experienced dragon slayers and offer thier most prized possessions in exchange for the dragons head on a pike . newline newline later that same week the companions rode into town upon thier warhorses , dressed in an armor comprised of dragon scales and monstrous trophies . up the mountain they climbed for days until finally reaching the top . newline newline as they rounded the last peak what they saw perched upon the top was not exactly what had been expected , in fact they could nt help but stifle thier laughter . newline newline  tis just a babe !  the barbarian roared , holding his belly while nearly falling off the mountain . newline newline  aww he s such a cutie , ca nt we keep this one ?  the burglar insisted ,  he could sit on our shoulders like pirates parrot ! do you think it talks ?  newline newline  silence you fools !  the sorceress screamed ,  we know not what powers this beast could unleash  newline newline  perhaps he ll tickle us with his little whiskers of death !  the barbarian carried on continuing his laughter while throwing his axe into the ground with a thud .  i ll simply snap his neck and be done with it  newline newline  grognak get down ! it s preparing it s breath !  yelled the ranger just out of sight . newline newline the beast before them inhaled deeply . his long whiskers tickling his nose while his fur coat prickled with anticipation . his short stubby claws scratched on the rock and his chest puffed out preparing to unleash death . newline newline  ahhhhiccupoo  is all it said with a puff of smoke and saddened eyes as his fire had failed . newline newline instantly all the companions belted out laughter , rolling around the ground at the comedic disaster . newline newline  alright enough fun . it s been days since i ve had grog . let s get this over with and feed it to the dogs .  the barbarian said with a smile of dread . newline newline the small dragon quickly scrambled across the rocks , but was trapped in a corner . he spread his wings and flapped so hard , but could not raise from the ground more than a few feet . newline newline  caution my friend , this does nt seem right  the sorceress said , but the barbarian waved his hand and continued to walk his steady pace . his smile continued to spread across his scarred face . newline newline suddenly the small , furry dragon looked up the skys , then back at the barbarian with his own smile .  daddy s home .  is the last the companions ever heard as molten fire spread across the mountain . newline newline to this day no one had challenged the mountain and there the babe sleeps soundly asleep under the watch of the great dragoneven though the night sky above was covered black , the streets of lnc were lit and vibrant with endless neon . corner stores , brothels , and clubs all making their mark on the sleek roads that they stood , but none could compete with cl 3 . standing tall in the depths of chicago , cl 3 was the epitome of night living . the safe haven for prostitutes , drug enthusiasts , and general civilians looking for a fun night out , without the worry of being scanned by chicago augmented patrol  cl 3 was a fortress . on the outskirts of the grandiose establishment stood countless of hopeless souls looking , even begging for a way inside , but to no avail . first rule of cl 3 , you must be escorted in . that means no lines , no favors . second rule is once you re inside , you must remain in cl 3 for minimum of twentyfour hours . newline newline in the crowd of people clamoring at the steel doors of cl 3 , stood a young man dressed in all black . black suit , black slacks , black shoes . his jet black hair slicked back , revealing his sharp facial features . his glowing light blue eyes , high cheek bones , and a jaw line as strong as the concrete floor beneath him . he smoothly made his way towards the front of the commotion , reaching the door guards . to his dismay they were two androids . newline newline  hi , would you be able to let me through ?  he asked innocently newline newline  no , unless an escort is present , you may not go any further  said the android to his right . an older male model . no hair at all , with grey eyes . newline newline  i lost him  the man said coyly newline newline  that is not possible , escorts must remain with the attendee at all times  said the newer female model to his left . short red hair , with grey eyes as well . newline newline  i am antonio lopez , do nt you recognize me ?  he was hoping to use this line on a human guard , instead of an emotionless android with no sense of pop culture . the two androids stood silently , looking past him , paying him no mind . he gave a deep sigh . newline newline  check your guest list for this evening , i guarantee i m on there  newline newline the male android lifted his arm to launch a holographic page . his swiftly scrolled through the list , and stopped on antonio lopez . newline newline the man in black froze , his eyes fixated on the male android . newline newline the male android slowly turned to look at the man .  would you mind if i proceed with a facial scan ? it is a requirement for a high profile guest  newline newline  ii guess  newline newline  very well , please remain still  newline newline it started from his feet , a bright white plane of the light emitting from the androids eyes . slowly it crept up , to his mid section , to his chest , and finally his face . the android turned its scanning light off and stared at the man silently . the man became increasingly nervous . newline newline  is there a problem ?  he asked calmly newline newline  you were untruthful  the android asked , cocking its head sideways  why ?  newline newline  what are you on about ? i have nt lied !  the man fired back sternly newline newline  your escort has not been sent out as of yet , why did you lie ?  newline newline a shower of relief fell upon the man in black . he instantly relaxed , placing his hand on the androids shoulder newline newline  i was joking . you know humor . ack ! did you leave your download emotions at home ?  he said with chuckle  i know , i m early  newline newline the android studied the man curiously for a long period of time until it finally broke the silence newline newline  would you like me to escort you to madame monday ?  the android asked newline newline  yes , that would be appreciated  the man said wiping the nervous sweat off his brow newline newline the steel door opened automatically and slowly uncovered the inside of cl 3 . the noise was deafening . loud rhythmic melodies that shook the ground and everything around them . the floor was black marble with hints of white specks that would flicker when the light hit it a certain way . the room was empty , but vast . at the very other end was light posts with white neon signs that identified the different rooms of the cl 3 . behind the signs were doors . big , black , steel doors . newline newline  welcome to the entry hall , mr. lopez  the android said , as it briskly walked towards the neon signs ,  this is where you chose your different destinations , but first we must head to the penthouse , to madame monday  newline newline  mmhmm  the man said quietly as he observed the room around him . newline newline they head towards one of the doors to the very left , behind the sign that said  floors 50  99 , hpp and vip only  . behind the doors was a row of five more doors , all for separate floors in ten floor increments . they walked to the  90  99 , madame monday suite  door and took the room elevator . walking onto the ninetyninth floor , all was gold . the lights , the floor , the walls , the windows even had a tint of gold as well . newline newline  hmm , fancy  the man said as he continued to be escorted newline newline a woman sat in the middle of the room , seated on a golden chair , the only piece of furniture on the whole floor . the woman was quite old by the looks of it . graying hair and wrinkles plagued her face , and her stature , even though she was seated , was petite . newline newline  you may leave us tommy  she said gesturing the android to make leave newline newline  so what do you have for me today antonio ?  monday asked slumping into her chair newline newline  what s this room for and why is there only one chair ?  the man asked with his hand around his back , calmly pacing around the room newline newline  excuse me ?  newline newline  it seems trivial , right ? having hp guest come all the way up here , and not to be able to have a seat  he said smiling newline newline  lopez , enough with the meaningless and tasteless humor ! what are my sales through out this month ?  newline newline  i do nt know to be honest  newline newline  what !  monday yelled , straightening herself in her chair  what in gods name is the matter with you ? !  newline newline the man in black ignored her , and reached inside his lead laced pants pocket and pulled out two pills , one white and one black . he walked over to monday and crouched in front of her . newline newline  do you know what this is ?  he asked , moving closer to monday newline newline  no , what is it ?  newline newline  it s called face , the white one is face a , the black one face b  the man explained newline newline  what kind of high does it have ?  monday asked newline newline  i already had one of these today , but for the sake of demonstration  the man placed the black pill on his tongue and swallowed . he stared at monday as she grew concerned . almost instantly the man s face began to change . it became older and more feminine . he continued watching monday , as he became more and more horrified as the man in front of her was not who she thought , and now was becoming herself . newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline i  ll have 250 grams of fleshybits , a block of alpha carbohydrate texture five with seasoning blend seven , and 1 liter of krav fruit nectar with 10 percent ethyl alcohol please.  i said to the serving robot as i settled down into an appropriately sized booth in a dark corner of the starport bar . i had never been here before but the place looked promising . it had been quite some time since another human had been through here but they did give it a good rating . it didn  t stink , the air was quite breathable even without a respirator , and it was quiet and somewhat private . i am not one of those humans that detest the undue attention that one of our kind generates . i  ve been away from sol long enough that it didn  t really bother me . newline newline still , it was nice when i could have a quiet uninterrupted meal . it didn  t happen often . newline newline i took a bite of my meal . it was pretty damn good . the ai chef must have had humanity in its database or something . i pulled out my tablet and gave the place five stars . this watering hole needed to be on the map . newline newline as i looked up from my tablet , i saw an eyestalk peeping around the corner of my booth . i suppressed the reflex to smile pleasantly . it was often interpreted as baring one  s fangs . i instead made a figure eight motion with my hand , a universal gesture of friendly greeting . a smallish belot stepped into view . newline newline  you are a human !  newline newline  your mastery of the obvious is quite commendable.  the belot started giggling . well , it was more sneezing and appearing to have a mild seizure but that  s what they did . for some unknown reason the galaxy found humans amazingly funny . even the slightest bit of sarcasm was hilarious . newline newline i then invited the little guy to join me . he looked like he was about to pass out . i summoned the serving bot . i had wanted a quiet meal but i was quite possibly the only human this guy has ever or will ever see . there was no need for his encounter to be unpleasant . besides , i like belot . they are usually pretty decent beings . they have always been good company . i would probably have hired one on if i could manage the additional life support . newline newline  would you like something ? my treat.  the belot looked stunned . newline newline  i wouldn  t dare impose.  newline newline  relax , it isn  t an imposition.  it wasn  t . our reputation for being obscenely wealthy wasn  t unjustified . i probably had several hundred thousand times the wealth of this little guy . by galactic standards i was loaded . newline newline  seriously , get whatever you want.  the belot took me at my word and ordered himself quite the feast . i smiled to myself . he was being incredibly bold for one of his kind . i liked him . i suddenly felt like i was being watched . i glanced over and saw a table of belot just staring at us . well , they were staring more at him than me . i couldn  t help but grin . the belot drew back suddenly . newline newline  ohmygosh ! i  m sorry ! i didn  t mean.  newline newline  oh relax , eyeballs . this ...  i point at my toothy grin .  this is what we do when we are deeply amused.  newline newline  oh , that  s right . i remember now.  he sighed with relief and i laugh . a belot sigh sounds like a dozen little farts as air is released through numerous relaxed spicules . newline newline  looks like you made quite the impact on your comrades.  the belot squinted his eyes in a smile .  you  re pretty brazen for one of you little skittles.  the belot giggled again . newline newline  so , you are dining with a human . what do you want to talk about ?  newline newline  are you a musician ?  they always ask that . they expect every single human to be a musician , or an artist , or comedian , or something . it really doesn  t surprise me . that  s what we are known for . before interstellar travel it was sometimes thought that there may be other civilizations out there with superior technology that are watching earth and just not contacting us because we weren  t ready . well , they were almost right . we were being watched and they weren  t contacting us . it wasn  t because we weren  t ready though . newline newline it was because we were considered a galactic treasure . they decided they wouldn  t dare  ruin  us . newline newline our music , art , drama , design , history , even our technology was fascinating to the galaxy . ever since our first radio transmissions reached a remote trade route we overwhelmed a vulnerable galaxy not with our technology or firepower but with our culture . it turns out that most sentient species are a bit dull in the first place . pair that with most species being contacted much earlier on and thus adopting a near uniform technology and culture and you have the perfect petri dish for humanity to infect . newline newline and infect it we did . our culture , art , design , fashion , you name it took the galaxy by storm long before we did . by the time we did independently develop interstellar travel , the galaxy didn  t look like star wars . it looked like an ikea catalog . newline newline  no , sorry . not every human can sing or paint . i  m just a freighter captain.  newline newline  ooo ! have you been in many space battles ?  that was a fair question . a terran light freighter loaded with art , music , sculpture , etc . was a lot of money in a small package . piracy was not unheard of . as a result , our  freighters  were more like cutters or destroyers than the usual flying box . my ship was better armed than a lot of military vessels . newline newline  a few.  i don  t like to brag . i actually have more kills than most pilots out there . newline newline we continued to eat and drink for quite some time . as the alcohol  and formaldehyde  flowed we chatted about earth and what it was like there . as more relaxants flowed the conversation turned from the usual interview that i normally get to an actual increasingly drunken bullshit session where we talked about old lovers and stories about space travel and all sorts of bullshit . newline newline i wound up having to damn near carry eyeballs to his quarters . i poured him into the appendages of his completely astonished shipmates and staggered back to my hotel room . newline newline i wonder how he will react when he realizes that i slipped a data stick with a few gigabytes of live music recordings into his pocket . newline newline newlineharold knew it was too late as soon as he saw the green mass emerge from the sky . although he was as tall and as broad as any other man of his clan , he was just shy of16 years in this life but wise beyond his years . his face wore a pensive look , covered in a long , rough brown beard , almost to compensate for his shaven head . his companion and closest friend for all those years , christof , grabbed him roughly by the arm ,  i ... i ... it ca nt be real , can it ?  newline newline harold contemplated silently , looking at the fear in christofs eye . although only 6 days seperated them in age , christof was slight in stature , no more than a child , with a wisp of a blonde beard on his chin , his long blonde hair braided down his back . they had been told the tales of gnarr for as long as they could remember , spending nights shivering around the warm fire while their fathers had laughed and drank , recounting tales of this fabled creature , green scales shimmering as it lay scorn to villages similar to theirs for hundreds of years . as they grew older they believed it less and less and would join in with the laughter , sharing mead between them . newline newline  i fear we must return to the village christof . this is a dark omen  newline newline the two boys silently packed up their gear , each buckling their shields to their back and shouldering their spears . they had been practising for hours on the crest of the mountain , each hoping to become men at the festival of the moon on the morrow .sid opened his weary eyes in a pink bedroom with walls covered in one direction posters . not this again .  a girl , about thirteen with her hair tied into two messy buns and more makeup on than he saw on adult women back when he was still alive , stood on the side of a chalk outline of a pentagram on the ground . newline newline  oh , no ! you caught me ,  he said sarcastically , and withdrew his trusty pen that he carried with him at all times . since this so called television phenomenon every second idiot who summoned him assumed that they were experts at demonic traps and summons . he bent down , and scratched a line through the chalked circle and stepped out , watching the girl  s eyes widen . newline newline  iuh  she looked him up and down , taking a step back .  i want to make a deal ,  she said slowly , her eyes not leaving the smoke that billowed out of his collar and made up his head . newline newline  i want to make a deal , mr demon , please.  he smiled and took two quick steps toward her . the girl  s feet followed his , like in a dance , until she was pressed back against the wall of her bedroom , with her eyes pressed tightly shut . newline newline  i want to make a deal , mr demon , please ,  she repeated word for word , fast enough to win any tongue twister competition that she entered . newline newline  alright then , little hannah ,  he said , puffing out the smoke on his head theatrically .  what is it that your heart desires ?  newline newline  ffame ,  she said , turning her head away to avoid looking at him . not a wink would be slept tonight , no doubt . newline newline  ug ,  he grunted .  that boring ? what about a cure for diabetes ? finding life on another planet ? traveling through space ?  he took another look through the room , not a single book filled the white shelves that were secured to the walls . with the snap of his fingers , books appeared , knocking the jewelry and figurines off the shelves . hannah caught her head with her hands , and lowered down onto her knees . newline newline  if you  re not going to give me what i want , please leave.  newline newline  hey !  he stuck out a long greyed finger .  i  m helping.  sida rather mild name for a demon , he thoughthad one thousand souls to go before he was to be given the privilege of a real head . his hands , legs and torso he had to work off soul for soul over the years . the grand , grey wingswith chains that roared like reverberating thunderhe chose to go for first . he thought that it would make his deals easier , if a little fear was involved . after all , who would be frightened of a dark smoky figure in a suit with one hand or leg ? newline newline  i  ll give you what you want , kid.  he strolled around the room , opening his wings .  but you must open your eyes and look at me.  newline newline hannah complied , and relaxed her shoulders to the sound of his calm voice . children were the hardest to take souls fromyes , even for demons . it wasn  t just an instinct in animals and humans to protect the young . newline newline  look up to this head , and imagine those with horns and moles for skin , holes for eyes and claws for fingers . imagine earthly men that take pleasure in pain and put them all in one place , on every corner . those steps that you were afraid to take in the dark because of your imagined ghosts , there where you  ll go after this , they  ll be real.  newline newline hannah blinked a few times , her eyes fixed on nothing in particular , weighing her options .  i still want it.  newline newline sid pursed his lips , and shrugged .  alright then , kiddo . you have it.  he d learned better than to argue by now . once their eye glistened with greed and easy fortune , there was nothing you could tell them . not even that their life here would be over in a wink and the one thereafter , oh deary dear , that one has no end . newline newline  just like that ?  newline newline sid winked and spread the corners of his wings around himself , feeling the tug of another summon rushing into his wings .  see you in hell !  newline newline  newline thanks for reading ! newline newline here s some moderately shameless selfpromotion . ralinakg  my collection of older prompts and other writing .dear mom , newline newline hope all is well . things are heating up here . how s little julie ? my sweet niece had her first word a few days back , or so said maria on my last phone call . newline newline i d rather not talk about war right now . please understand . newline newline how s frank ? is he treating you well ? i dunno ma , i never trusted him but if you love him ... newline newline   newline newline sorry about that . cannon off to the side , had us rushing . anyway . newline newline could you tell nancy i love her ? i ll hopefully be in time for the birth , but no hope , you know ? heh . but , uh , i ll be home i hope , very soon , and nancy and i will give you your second grandbaby ! newline newline ... war s tearing at me , ma . making me a mite insane . but i love you all . i love y   newline newline    newline newline my name is frederico . i am 15 years old . and i killed your son . newline newline nothing i say will make it better , nor will anything i say make him come back . i would like indeed to say one thing , before you rip this bottom portion off , as i hope and know you will , so as to keep the last letter he wrote . newline newline i believe he was well loved , and loved well in return . he did not see me when i killed him . it did not take long , in fact it was quick . i can only hope the same for my death . newline newline i know that seems harsh from a killer . but it is true . i would like to die . i did not sign up for this war . i was brought into it by the rebels . newline newline i end this letter with the hopes that in another life , i could have met such a lovely family as his , and been friends with all of you . newline newline frederico , rebel of the 54th squadron , orphan . newline newline blood is spattered in places , fingerprints at the very bottom . the very top is written with a steady hand , frederico s writing is nervous , shaky . it smells of gunpowder okay , say it again , but try to really mean it this time .  newline newline we were sitting on our bed , both crosslegged and facing each other . john looked at me with something that resembled both annoyance and amusement . he cleared his throat dramatically , and threw his arms wide open as he spoke with the conviction and enunciation of a seasoned thespian . newline newline  i hereby declare my sincerest , undying love for my beautiful wife !  he said .  never before has there been a woman more beautiful , nor one more kind . i shall love her every day from here on out !  newline newline typical . i could nt ever get him to take anything seriously . tears welled up in my eyes , and i tried to brush them away before they could make their way onto my cheeks . john s arms fell to his sides , and he moved a little closer . newline newline  hey , hey  are you okay ? look , i m sorry , i just do nt know what you want me to do .  he shifted awkwardly . newline newline i shook my head and took his hands in mine . it was easier to look at our hands , as they lay there between us , than to face his questioning gaze . i tried to memorise what it looked like when his thumb stroked the back of my hand , but the tears blurred my vision and made this almost impossible . a sound escaped my throat , and before i knew it , i was sobbing . great , i thought . i have less than twenty four hours to try and remember what everything looks like , and i m spending most of that time bawling like a baby .  newline newline  it s just ...  i started ,  i do nt know . i ll miss seeing sunrises and stuff , and i m scared that everything is just going to be dark from now on , but what scares me most  a sob interrupted my pathetic attempt at an explanation . john stroked my arms carefully , and waited for me to continue . if only i knew how to continue .  newline newline  it ll be fine , i promise . they told us about all those websites with information that might help you adjust . and i ve spoken to my boss , i can take a whole month off to help you get used to everything . you ll be running around the house in no time . plus ... being blind s better than being dead , right ?  his voice had done a weird little thing when he said the word dead . i could nt blame him , the diagnosis had scared the living daylight out of us . of course , daylight was another thing i d have to give up . newline newline  i know . i know that . but the only thing i just ca nt give up is seeing how you look at me when you tell me you love me .  he started to say something , but i interrupted .  no , not when you re being an idiot like just now . when you really mean it , there s this ... i do nt know , there s just something in your eyes . and it makes my heart flutter and my knees weak , and i do nt want to lose that .  newline newline we were quiet for a bit , each listening to the other s breathing . newline newline suddenly , he gave my hands a tight squeeze .  anna ?  newline newline i looked up . i blinked the tears away to the best of my ability and tried to look past the shooting pain and the veil that still made everything a little blurry . newline newline  i love you .  he said . newline newline and he meant it . and it was perfect . newline newline dammit osiris !  cody slammed the door to his bedroom .  put my room back dude , not cool , i need my shoes , i have class in five minutes .  newline newline osiris laughed and snapped his fingers ,  there little buddy , your room has been returned to this dimension .  cody exhaled an angry breath and tried the knob again , this time it was locked , he kicked it in frustration . newline newline  will you please unlock my door ?  newline newline  i did nt lock it .  osiris said smiling . newline newline  please unlock it . i have to go .  newline newline osiris shook his head and waved his hand toward the blank wall to cody s right . the wall became a projection of cody saying  do not unlock my door again , do you understand ? when it s locked that means i do nt want it opened , not by you , not by anyone .  newline newline  i m merely respecting your wish . you can open it with a flat head screw driver , there s one in the drawer near the fridge .  osiris turned back to the tv and began flipping through channels . when he reached the sports channel he set down the remote and snapped his fingers causing a beer to appear in his other hand .  man , that guy hector from upstairs left some really good beer in his fridge , i m sure he wo nt miss one  , osiris snapped his fingers again and a second can appeared ,  or two , would you like one ?  newline newline cody slammed the drawer after finding the screwdriver ,  no , i have to go to class . i told you that .  newline newline  one beer is nt gon na kill you , it ll mellow you out .  osiris tilted the can back and began to chug the contents as cody worked the screwdriver into the door lock . after several seconds of rattling it around , the lock popped open and cody stepped into his room . newline newline  what the fuck ! ? ! ? ! ?  cody shut the door , his eyes were wide and his breathing rate had tripled .  what s is that thing ?  newline newline osiris looked up grinning ,  that is probably whatever locked your door .  newline newline cody shook his head ,  please , i need my laptop and shoes out of there . can you either teleport them out here or get rid of that thing ? please ?  newline newline osiris laughed and clapped his hands , cody s shoes and laptop bag appeared on the chair next to him . he picked up each of his shoes and inspected them for snakes , it had become a habit , he also checked the bag for good measure .  thank you  , said cody as he went to open the front door . newline newline osiris snickered as cody jumped at a loud thunder clap and a torrent of rain began to fall . newline newline  why ? why did you do that ? i do nt have an umbrella , make it stop .  newline newline  i did nt make it start .  newline newline cody slammed the door in frustration .  you at least knew it was going to rain , that s why you laughed , why did nt you tell me .  newline newline  cody , your tv picks up the weather channel same as mine .  osiris had opened the second beer and begun drinking it . he snapped his fingers and another can appeared on the table .  man , i am so glad hector left a full fridge .  newline newline  yea , you made his sheets come to life and try and strangle him , i d forget the beer on my way out in that scenario as well .  cody dug through the closet for a jacket that was somewhat waterproof . newline newline  i did nt strangle him , just had them wrap him up and pull him under the bed , harmless fun . besides , he and his friends are nt stomping around all night anymore .  newline newline cody put the jacket on and began walking out the door . osiris smiled and cracked the third beer as the front door closed and the yeti walked out of cody s room .  oh , i forgot about you . did you mess the room up ?  the yeti snarled at osiris and began walking toward him . osiris just yawned and made the yeti disappear with a flick of his wrist .  i m sure hector would like some company .  he picked up the remote and hit a series of buttons . hector appeared on the screen , sitting on his porch at home , enjoying a hot cup of coffee in the dismal weather . osiris smiled and leaned toward the tv ,  this will be good . i am alone , but i am happy . newline newline some people say that hell s a lake of fire , but i disagree . hell s other people , and their damned fickleness . newline newline my life used to be dedicated to protecting people . i sacrificed everything i had so that others might not have to do the same . i threw away everything i had , i spent every resource at my disposal , all to make sure that there was less suffering in the world . i threw away six years of my life , so that others might not have their lives taken from them . i sacrificed opportunities that could have set me up for life , just so that one less funeral would be neccessary . my ties to friends and family withered and died , all because i was working so hard to ensure that nobody would have to endure what i did . newline newline then ... when i asked for help from the world , when i asked for mercy from my fellow men ... they turned upon me . they ripped me apart , ridiculed me , and told me that the world would be better if i were nt in it . newline newline so i left . i abandoned the world , i abandoned humanity to its fate . i found a nice secluded hole to crawl into ... and i have nt really left it for a long time . newline newline i am alone , that is true . i do nt get many visitors , and the ones who do arrive tend to be horribly lost . but every one of them that walks through my door , every one that i find passed out from exhaustion , hunger , or thirst ... every single one of them appreciates the time i spend helping them . newline newline i am alone , and i am happy .i ve always felt like my two favorite subreddits , this and rnosleep went hand in hand , and i think this is the perfect wp to prove that . i ll post this on both . certainly is nt my best work , but i typed what came to mind and it s 7 am and i ve been up since 9 am yesterday . this also ended up being much longer than i intended so it s cut into parts , and went a different route than i thought it would . comments and suggestions are welcome and wanted . as an aspiring film writer , i d love all the help i can get . enjoy ! newline newline newline newline i was never anything special . i was average . in school , i never got many girls , and i did nt have many friends . it was nt like i got picked on , like some loser that was the perfect prey for bullies , i just did nt really have anything to do with anyone . i was ignored by most people , but not in a mean way , more of the kind of ignoring that you do with a bug in the sidewalk . you just have no reason to mess with it . it is doing its own thing , and you re doing your own thing . that was all fine with me . i liked the solitude . the one real friend i had was like me , mostly . jacob was a loner that was just passed by , nobody bothered him , and he bothered nobody . but like i said , he was mostly like me . the one thing that made us different , the one thing that made me different from everyone , was this weird power . newline now i do nt know how i got it , if i was born with it , if it developed , any of that . as far back as i can remember , i had been able to do it . i ca nt even tell you much about it , other than what it does . i do nt even know how to control it , i just , do it . okay so , you know how when someone is blind , people say their other senses are heightened , like their sense of smell and hearing ? that s basically what i could do , but by choice . by giving up one sense , i could power up the others , slightly , or one , greatly . as far as i knew i could only rid myself of one at a time , though i had been practicing on expanding my power . i had no idea if i could , but i was trying . newline i wanted to use my power for good , maybe become an investigator , or become a superhero , but i worried that i could have been discovered and with our shady government , for all i know i would ve been locked up and tested on . so i basically became one of those guys you see in movies , where they work in a cubicle on the computer or phone all day . it was nt a bad job , it was nt the most fun , but the benefits made up for that . i was still friends with jacob throughout my life , and we d meet up every so often for drinks , or food , or just to watch a game . newline jacob was the only one that knew about my power , and he was cool about it . sometimes he d have me over to help him with stuff , like one time his car would nt work properly , so i used my hearing to find something that did nt sound right . i did nt mind , it was actually pretty cool being able to use my power for good , even if it was just my friend having car troubles . newline one day i was on my way home from work and he texted and asked if i wanted to get drinks . i met him at our usual spot and had a beer . he was nt as talkative as he usually was , so i used my power to see if i could tell what was up . i saw that he was sweating a bit more than a normal person would , and i could hear his pulse beating a little quicker than normal . i asked him what was up and he denied a problem at first , but once i told him what i sensed he confessed . newline  look man , it sounds a little crazy , but i think there s something wrong with my place . i do nt know how to explain it , i just have nt felt right the past few days while i was there .  he did nt sound crazy , but i did nt quite understand what he meant . newline  am i rubbing off on you maybe ? giving you a bit of my power ? your senses all messed up ?  i thought a little joke like that would help him lighten up a bit , and he smiled slightly but got serious again and said it was nt like that , it was more of a sixth sense kind of thing . newline now i do nt know about you , but i never believed too much in a sixth sense . i could change my senses but i never had the ability to sense things mentally or spiritually or whatever . so i just assumed it was nt real . jacob looked convinced though . something was definitely unsettling him . newline  jake , if you want , i ll come over and have a look around , just to put you at ease , because i m sure it s nothing .  i tried to assure him that there was nt a ghost or spirit or curse or something going on , so he was glad i offered to help , but he still seemed to think there was nt something right with his place . newline we got to his apartment complex about an hour after some more drinks and talking about other things . no matter the topic of conversation , he still looked perturbed . we got to his apartment and i started with my sight first . seeing this as a good opportunity to test my power some more , i focused on ridding myself of an extra sense . i lost my taste so i could see better , and very slightly , slowly , started to lose feeling as well . after a few minutes , it finally worked . i could nt feel the texture of the chair i was sitting in , and i could see so much better than 2020 vision . eye doctors would have to come up with a new scale with how well i could see every . i saw every speck of dust and dirt . my eyes darted all around his place taking in everything . after about 15 minutes , i switched over to smell . still numb and unable to taste , i smelled the whole apartment . some good stuff , like the pie that was baking a few floors up , and some bad stuff , like someone s rotting garbage , probably left there for a few weeks . still , nothing out of the ordinary in his place . he watched me intently , waiting for something . newline i went back to normal and told him my findings so far . i got some water and sat back down to use my hearing this time . that was not a problem at all . i used it the most by far , and could instantly power it up once i lost one sense . so i lowered my taste again , and then focused on my feeling , and then slowly , as not to blow out my ears from the sounds of the city outside , raised my hearing . newline there was so much going on , it was hard to hear anything . cars outside , people down the road outside a bar talking loudly , music the other way , probably a band at another bar , a radio upstairs , people talking , a couple fighting , a dog , a baby . so much going on , i slowly blocked them all out , one by one , till i listened only to the silence of jacob s apartment . i heard his breathing and heart beating , but as i sat there , i heard it . newline screaming , but not just screaming like from the people down the street having a party . no this , this was more like someone being tortured in the pits of hell , this was someone who was so terrified of something , that nobody had ever known such a fear . it only got worse from there , more screams , more people , all around me . it seemed like it was his apartment , the floor , the walls , the fridge , his couch , everything was alive and dying in terrible agony . i was incredibly intrigued , and slightly scared , not knowing what was happening . i kept listening , try to hear something else , or maybe where they were coming from , perhaps one was screaming words , but none of that came . let me pass !  pontius  voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd . like fresh snow in spring the assembled group melted back , revealing a path to the plinth upon which it stood . one or two bowed their heads respectfully as the senator passed , but many stared at him . they were hard faced and angry , gaunt men with fire in their eyes and angry women clutching children to their side . walking beside his master , aquilus kept close , for fear that the crowd would forget their places . newline newline newline they stayed , however , watching pontius as he approached the glass ball . someone had placed it on a velvet pillow , and it was nestled there as a pearl in an oyster , reflecting the midday sun . to aquilus  ears the sounds of the market had stilled . no flies buzzed , no traders haggled . even the familiar sound of priests preaching to whoever would hear them was absent . newline newline newline aquilus remembered the sentries on the gates as they had passed through in the cool morning . even in their leather and bronze uniform they had looked thin . no cats or dogs chased each other through the narrow streets . he could not smell bread , could not see a single amphora . this city was starving . the children around him were bloated in their hunger and their eyes followed him . he hurried his step . newline newline newline pontius extended a hand towards the glass marble and the crowd held its breath . aquilus watched a bead of sweat as it escaped his master s hairline and trickled down his neck . pontius licked his lips . his finger touched against the glass marble and his eyes flickered shut . he was transfixed , held there for an eternity , though when he let go aquilus realised it had only been as long as it took to release a breath . newline newline newline  i understand ,  pontius said to the assembled crowd . still the men watched him in silence . no weapons were permitted in the forum , but one or two had whips or short knives at their sides . all aquilus held was the wax tablet , beginning to melt fluidly under his arm in this heat . pontius carried no armament himself .  i understand ,  he said again .  our gods have spoken .  newline newline newline aquilus flicked a nervous glance towards the marble . the sun beamed overhead , glowing against the clear glass . newline newline newline  what have you learned , master ?  he asked in an undertone to pontius . newline newline newline  only the man who touches it can know ,  pontius replied evenly .  but we must not delay , we must leave this city as soon as we can .  newline newline newline  the horses will not be fresh ,  aquilus responded . they had begun to move through the crowd again . was it his imagination or were there more of them than before ? tanned brown hands moved to the knives at their belts . pontius  steps were slow and unhurried , like those of a man in a dream . newline newline newline  damn the horses ,  pontius said . his face was pouring with sweat .  we must ...  he keeled , down onto his knees . aquilus grasped at his master s arm as the man fell , looking up at the hungry crowd as they closed around him . one man bared his teeth like a dog . newline newline newline  what did you see ?  aquilus asked , struggling to raise the man up again . tanned hands reached for him and he slapped them away .  off ! off !  he cried .  what did you see ?  newline newline newline  you must touch it to know ,  pontius wheezed . newline newline newline aquilus reached for the marble , the sun glaring from the glass into his eye and as he touched the smooth glass , he was blind . newline newline newline and he saw the fall . barbarians spilling into the white city . sacking , looting , burning . an empire brought to its knees , the bronze wolf turned upon her side and her suckling babes turned out onto the hard roads . he removed his hand and saw the same fire in the crowd s eyes that he knew blazed in his own . it was no longer a time for worship , but a time for war .superhero ? nah , supervillain ! newline newline i mean , not that i m a supervillain , per se . but i m a pretty damn good villain . newline newline i can establish dominance over anyone that i meet , as long as i have a line of direct eye contact to them . after that , they re just a glorified bag of meat , eager to please me , until i release them . hypnosis with no bars is a pretty cool power to have , especially when you re fighting the likes of uberguy . newline newline the idiot runs around the town , flying through towers and tossing cars left and right with no heed for the damage he causes . the worst part ? everyone praises him for the destruction he causes ! newline newline me ? i ll rob a bank and be a mile before i release everyone and no one will know what happened . plus i do nt kill people . newline newline  hypnosister !  uberguy screams as he slams through the bank vault , blowing a massive hole in the concrete and steel wall . chunks of stone and metal fly everywhere , one hitting the secretary i brought in to carry out my money in the head and killing her . another hit the bank manager s knee and he dropped like a rock . newline newline  really , uberdude ?  i turned and raised my hands .  you killed two people !  newline newline  no , foul villain !  he cried , his voice somehow amplified like it always was .  it is you , that killed these poor citizens !  newline newline i shut my eyes at the drops of saliva hitting my face . the balaclava did little to protect me from supersonic saliva droplets . newline newline  now , evil cretin ! prepare to  uberguy began , but i fixed my eyes directly onto his and he froze , his pupils dilating severely . newline newline  go fuck yourself .  i commanded and he grunted at the implications , before flying away in a blast of air . newline newline i grabbed a duffel bag of money off of the ground and tapped the poor secretary on the shoulder .  call an ambulance .  i commanded , tucking a burner phone into her clenched fist . newline newline then i darted off into the night , releasing the prisoners once i was sufficient distance away . lock !  i threw myself backward onto the metal grate floor and crawled helplessly backward away from the thick metal door that hissed loudly as it sealed . a heartbeat later a resounding thud echoed around the small corridor , then another and another then an unending screech that , even through the thick metal cut through me so deeply i thought it would make my ears bleed . newline newline what the fuck was that that thing . it looked somewhat human , two legs , about the same length torso , a head , neck . it s about there that the similarities ended though from the glimpse of it i d seen it looked like a nightmarish amputee a steaming pile of stinking flesh that screeched and ran , and cut . oh god the cutting how could i even forget for a second the cutting . newline newline it had moved quickly and silently at first . if it had nt been for the motiontriggered lights inside the compound i would nt have stood a fucking chance . newline newline the facility has only a limited power supply so to try and make sure that no power was wasted the system was designed to waste nothing that meant that the facility was plunged into darkness until someone moved into the area when the system would turn on the lights . newline newline i d been making my way from the cafeteria to the medstation , eve had been sick lately gone off her food for four or five days now , but potpie was her favourite so maybe i could tempt her ... newline newline then the lights came on at the end of the corridor . illuminating the doors to the surgery in a frame of black , i felt uneasy then the next light flickered into life a few feet closer to me . what a malfunction ? the lights were only supposed to react to motion . newline newline i squinted into the darkness as another light flickered on , my unease shifted to nervousness maybe fear . i continued to search the dark between me and the slowly advancing light . newline newline then blackness . i d been stood still staring for a few seconds too long , the and the motion detector deactivated the light above me , i felt my heart skip as i glanced up and heart the wirr of the sensor flickering the light back into action newline newline a screech rocked the hallway and suddenly in my peripheral vision i saw a black mass fall from the cieling casting a black silouette against the light of the surgery doors . i snapped my head to it s direction and waited horrific seconds for the light to activate above it . newline newline too late in a burst of speed it tore it s way toward me with powerful legs and that hellish screech . on instinct i screamed and tumbled backward ,  shut !  newline newline the metal door closed from the ceiling with nightmarelike slowness , all the while i could see the lights flickering on down the hall , and the creatures silouette advancing quickly . newline newline two legs . newline newline a head . newline newline a neck . newline newline a torso . newline newline human ? that tail flailing behind it cutting deep into the thick metal of the compound wall creating a horrible screech of torn metal as it lashed back and forward was that where the sound had come from i did nt care . newline newline  lock !  the door hissed as the lock engaged a heartbeat later the beast thudded heavily into the metal that screech of torn metal ... would the door even slow it down ? you know ,  said satan ,  your mother does nt have to die .  newline newline johnny , still clasping his mother s hand , turned and looked at the towering shadow on the wall .  did ... did you say that ?  he trembled , pointing at the mysterious black shape . newline newline  oh yes , that s me ,  said satan .  as i just told you , i can save your mother . i can tell you know that she will die in one hour . look at her , johnny . she s slipping , even now .  newline newline tears welling in his eyes , johnny s eight year old eyes sunk in the sight of his dying mother . she sat upright in the hospital bed , as she had for the past eight days . tubes , wires , and needles covered every inch of her shrunken arms , making her look more mechanical than human . the hospital blankets covered her frail body like a shroud , and her chest barely moved with each shuddering breath . her failing heart trembled in her chest as she resided in a tormented dream , from which she quite possibly might not wake up from . newline newline  what do you want ?  johnny cried , galvanized by his mother s frailty . as she had protected him , it was his job to protect her . newline newline  so you are willing to gamble ?  asked satan , licking his lips in anticipation . newline newline  yes ,  said johnny , stoic in his determination to save his mother . as you may know , a mother will give up anything to save her child . the same goes for any kid : they will protect their parents at all costs . newline newline  excellent , let s begin !  snarled satan .  i will save your mother . she will live many more years . under no circumstance will she die i can see to that .  with that , johnny s mother gasped for air , and her lungs expanded , finding newborn strength .  i can also take it away  and johnny s mother slipped back into sleep  if you do not respect our deal .  newline newline  with every extra day your mother lives , your death will be 2 days sooner . do you agree ?  newline newline  i agree .  newline newline  excellent ,  cackled satan , and with that , he vanished . newline newline johnny collapsed into his mother s lap and began to weep .she was ticked off , again . they knew it was a problem with her . she could nt help it . she d been raised to finish what she started . but they constantly scheduled her for just start of these long flights . but she had an ace in the hole , this

he be ?   your highness . murresh dehobo has returned from his mission and he , ah , wishes to see you .  newline newline king tyre rahnt looked up from his breakfast . steward planner had served him for years , ever since king rahnt had the previous steward , the mage beet rayor , executed for treason against the crown . planner was stalwart in his service and unflinching in his duties , and had never before balked at delivering any news to the king , good or bad . and yet here , delivering what should be happy news , planner was stuttering over his words as if he feared for his own life . newline newline  day , my old friend .  rahnt eyed the steward with concern .  what is the matter ? send him in .  newline newline  he , ah ,  planner wiped sweat from his forehead , despite the unseasonable chill .  he wishes to meet you in the court yard . sire .  newline newline rahnt s eyes narrowed .  and who does he think he is , to set the place of our meeting ?  newline newline  i fear it is required , sire .  newline newline king rahnt dropped his spoon into his bowl , splattering milk and old timey oat flakes onto the tablecloth . he heaved himself from his chair , strong arms pushing on the table to lift his bulk . he was a large man , larger than any other , and it was all muscle . rahnt was not a man to be taken lightly . newline newline  very well ,  rahnt said .  bring my sword , and lead the way .  newline newline planner rushed to retrieve the king s sword from its resting place near the throne at the back of the room . king rahnt could have turned and reached it himself from where he d been seated eating breakfast , but no king does what he can get others to do for him . with a heavy grunt and other noises besides , planner lifted the sword in both arms . he turned to rahnt and knelt , doing his best to not let the weight of the weapon  as tall as planner himself was , nearly as thick from edge to edge , and easily weight as much as the old clerk  pull him forward and onto his face . rahnt took the sword and set it on his shoulder with no more effort than he might have used to do the same with his cereal spoon . planner scrambled to his feet and hurried before the king , opening doors and announcing his passing through the labyrinthine halls of palace soshal comehntery . newline newline when at last the king and his steward arrived in the palace courtyard , the king nearly dropped his sword himself . he was dumbfounded , unable to make sense of what he was seeing . there , flanked by a row of a dozen palace guards and royal knights on either side , stood an adventurer . rahnt recognized him as dehobo . slung over dehobo s shoulder was a sack , clearly containing a body , and dripping blood over the black and red and thoroughly evil cobblestones . in his hand , dehobo held a length of chain , and on the other end of that chain was a deeply humbled and very alive dragon . newline newline  murresh ,  the king spoke as loudly as he could through clenched teeth . newline newline  it it please you , my lord , please call me mur . mur dehobo , adventurer for hire .  newline newline  i know who you are , dehobo !  king rahnt was furious .  what is the meaning of this ? you bring a dragon here ? and where is damsil ? where is my daughter ?  newline newline  sire ? according to the information i was given , i was supposed to bring the dragon here .  confusion passed over dehobo s face . newline newline  why would i want you to bring a dragon here ?   rahnt thrust a thick finger at the dragon , which barely acknowledged him or anything else .  you were meant to kill the dragon , and bring back my daughter .  newline newline dehobo cocked his head to one side , thinking . for a moment , he did look appropriately afraid . but then his eyes widened in realization . he dropped the bloody sack to stone , where it landed with a wet crunch . the princess s crown fell out of the sack , rolling in tighter and tighter circles until it clattered to stillness . all the while , dehobo was digging through his pouches and pockets . rahnt was just about to order dehobo executed on the spot when dehobo gave a shout . newline newline  ah , here it is !  dehobo produced a palmsized scroll case from a pocket . rahnt recognized it . it was the sort the adventurer s league handed out to adventurers who had taken a job , and contained notes regarding the specifics of the job . not the full description , just a brief summary penned when the job was accepted , intended to finalize terms and ascertain compensation once the job was done . newline newline dehobo opened the case and pulled out the scroll . he read aloud to himself , skipping over some of it .  dragon , princess ... north along deeemrayl road ... stock map tower ... ah ! yeah !  dehobo turned the scroll towards the king and thrust a finger at the next point on the list .  slay damsil , return with dismal .  newline newline rahnt s eyes went wide .  why would i want you to slay damsil and return with dismal ? dismal is the dragon , you dolt !  rahnt fetched a kick at the dragon , but the dragon gave no indication it noticed .  damsil is my daughter !  newline newline dehobo considered this for a moment .  that does make more sense . must have been a mixup at the league office . you ll want to have words with the clerk . i think his name is dys ? dys lexia , that sounds right .  newline newline rahnt could nt find words through his anger . he turned and pointed at his sword , his eyes on steward planner . planner took a moment to catch on , but then set to hauling the king s sword to the king . newline newline dehobo seemed unconcerned . he spoke to rahnt s back .  so , hey , listen ? does this mean i do nt have to marry the dragon after all ? because it says here i have to marry dismal , and i d rather just have gold .  newline newline dismal took notice of that . hurt and insulted , she stripped the chain off her neck and rose up to full height . the assembled soldiers did nt have time to react to this first sign of life she d shown since she arrived . she burned them all to death with a gout of dragonflame , next turning it on the king and steward . she looked at dehobo with sadness for a moment before burning him as well , and then took the air , a single tear sliding down her scaled cheek . newline newline she d been quite excited about being a bride . newline newline come on !  my sister yelled .  let s go !  newline newline  just a minute !  i yelled back . i stood on the edge of the broken highway , staring into the distance , hand over my brow to shield the glaring sun . the mountains were so beautiful , i could nt help but linger . their blue silhouettes lined the horizon like the edge of the world , with the long road ahead visible for miles and miles . the city was nt too far away , i thought . we could probably make it there by sundown if we kept a good pace . newline newline we had only been walking for a few days , but it felt like weeks . grandma had been ill , and father had gone to the city for medicine . he had nt been back for a month . then the rains came . i d never seen them this bad . it started to flood , first our fields , then our house . we kept dry enough in the attic , and scavenged as much food as we could before it all spoiled . my sister and i tried to help grandma , but she was too weak to survive without the medicine . she passed away just as the flood subsided . we buried her in the backyard . we had started getting used to surviving on our own without father , but we had no reason to stay at the farm . our neighbor barely had enough food to survive on his own , and had no way to take us in . so we told him we planned to leave town , in case father came back and wondered where we were . newline newline as we traveled , we discovered just how bad the flooding had been . major roads like this one had fallen apart , and no one had been out to fix them . it was like a wasteland . it felt like the end of the world , and we were the only survivors . newline newline i hoped we d find father in the city . our only clue was a shop he told us about , where he said he d go for the medicine . what had happened to him ? had he gotten hurt ? had he lied to us and abandoned us ? i know he d been grieving ever since mom died , but that was a few years ago now . we both longed to know where he was . newline newline  sis , come on !  she whined . she started walking back towards me , frowning . newline newline  alright , i m coming .  i sat down , dangling my legs over the side of the highway , a good six or seven feet between me and the road below . i braced myself and jumped , landing on my feet safely . newline newline  what were you looking at ?  she asked . newline newline  i think we can make it to the city by sundown .  she raised her eyebrows , as if she knew that was nt what i was thinking about . i sighed .  and , i miss father . he would have stood up there , looking at the mountains like that too . remember when he took us on walks in the forest near the farm , and spent way too long looking at the mountains when we got to the cliffs ?  newline newline  yeah . i miss him too .  newline newline i hugged her , overcome with gratitude that i still had her to hang on to . i felt tears in the corners of my eyes . newline newline she pulled away and looked at me .  it ll be alright . we ll get there , we ll find him .  newline newline i nodded , letting myself believe her words , despite knowing in the back of my mind that they were a lie . a lie she wanted to believe too . newline newline we walked down the road , hand in hand , hoping against hope we d see father again .the nurses avoided looking at me , as they always didas everyone always did . even the doctor standing in front of the door , flipping through his clipboard , did nt look up . newline newline  ah , you re here ,  he said , almost mumbling the words . newline newline  yes.  newline newline he hesitated , leaving a page halfflipped for a moment , before lowering the clipboard . the wall beside me must have had something interesting to look at .  well , you ve read the file , i presume ?  newline newline  yes.  newline newline he nodded .  then , go ahead.  he stepped to the side . newline newline i twisted the handle , opening the door without a creak . the dim room had little in common with most of the hospital , covered in soft tiles that did nt quite shine antiseptic white . slits for windows meant it never looked particularly bright without the light on . newline newline what really set the room apart , though , was its occupant . today , she sat on the edge of the bed , striped by sunlight . newline newline as usual , i took my seat in the middle of the room , crosslegged on the floor . newline newline nothing changed , for a while . the padding muffled the rest of the world , and nothing in the room divulged the time , so i could nt say how long that while lasted . but , eventually , she moved . her movements slow , she turned her upper body , leaning back on the bed . newline newline her eyes looked familiar . newline newline she took her time staring at me , with no expression on her face . then , she took more time to adjust herself , sitting on the edge facing me in a more comfortable manner . finally , she spoke . newline newline  who are you ?  newline newline i did nt smile .  i m here to listen.  newline newline  listen to what ?  newline newline  anything you would like me to listen to.  newline newline she stared at me , and then just to the side of me . her body did nt move with any tics , hands and legs still . the seconds trickled into minutes , and probably into hours given the movement of the slits of sunshine . newline newline the door rattled , and a nurse came in , balancing two trays . i accepted one with thanks , and the other tray got left on the bed amidst silence . the door closed once more . i ate the small portion of soup slowly , spreading out the bread to match how much soup i had left . after finishing the main meal , i moved on to the slightly melted icecream . meanwhile , she had nt touched her food or , as far as i could tell , moved at all . newline newline darkness soon slipped through the windows , displaced by the overhead light flickering on . it had a much colder tone , with a hint of blue . newline newline  go already.  newline newline she had nt moved , not even her eyes . i did nt respond . newline newline  how long are you gon na stay here ?  newline newline  as long as it takes.  newline newline  for what ?  newline newline  for you to tell me what you want me to listen to.  newline newline she did nt laugh , or roll her eyes , or rub her brow . nothing changed about her , but her lips when she spoke , and the soft rise and fall of her chest as she breathed . newline newline  what kind of a job is that ?  newline newline i adjusted what she said slightly , and answered ,  it s my job to listen to whoever is in this room , and answer any questions they may have for me.  newline newline  ah , you re the shrink who has to listen to the crazies.  newline newline she showed some emotion with that last word , her lips curving into a glimmer of a smile . newline newline  does nt it drive you mad , listening to us ?  newline newline  no , it doesnt.  newline newline that set off another stretch of silence , which infected the world at large as the hospital wound down for the night . matching that , the light above dimmed , giving the whole room the appearance of being in shadow . what little colour remained became muted , a shade of grey and nothing more  her hair , her skin , the hospital gown , and her eyes . newline newline  why not ?  she asked , and her voice had quieted too , matching . newline newline i thought i knew , but asked ,  why not what precisely ?  perhaps if the light had nt dimmed , i may have seen the flashes that trailed in her features , but the shadows blurred them . newline newline  sitting there , listening to pain day after day , why does nt that hurt you ?  newline newline i held my reply a beat , and asked ,  do you really want to know ?  newline newline her gaze shifted minutely , from the side of my face to my eyes . it delayed her reply , but it eventually came .  yes.  newline newline  i do nt have emotions.  newline newline her eyes reacted , once more though blurred by the dim lighting .  how can you even do your job ?  newline newline  my job is to listen , not to feel.  newline newline  what good does that do ?  newline newline  a lot.  newline newline she held her reply between pursed lips , letting it fade away . after a while , she instead asked ,  why would telling you help me now i know you do nt care ?  newline newline  you re mistaken , i do care.  newline newline  how can you possibly care if you re dead inside ?  newline newline  if i made a robot , could i make it empathise without having emotions of its own ?  newline newline her mouth stayed open for a moment , before she replied .  i do nt know.  when no reply came from me , she rephrased her earlier question .  how can you care without emotions ?  newline newline  i value human life and wellbeing.  newline newline  but , how can you do that ?  newline newline  i choose to . it s the axiom of my morality.  newline newline  but why ? if it ca nt ever make you happy , why do anything ?  newline newline  if i did nt do anything , i would nt be here.  newline newline  that s not an answer.  newline newline  it s the closest one i can give . the only one , in fact.  newline newline  so , you do things because you do things ?  newline newline  yes . i m like a robot who has been asked why it does what it has been programmed to do.  newline newline  is that how you see yourself ?  newline newline  no.  newline newline my answer sat on her lips , silently echoed back to me . then , she asked ,  would you be sad if i killed myself ?  newline newline  no.  newline newline  would you cry at my funeral ?  newline newline  no.  newline newline  would you stay up late into the night , trying to think what you could have done differently to save me ?  newline newline  no.  newline newline my answers sat on her lips , accompanied by a smile .  no , huh ?  newline newline  no , i wouldnt.  newline newline she leant forwards , and the shadows darkened over her face , veiling it in a blur that hid her away .  do you hate me ?  newline newline  no.  newline newline  liar ,  she said .  you d rather i just spilled my guts to you . instead , i m asking stupid questions , wasting your time.  newline newline i did nt reply , and she grew as restless as she d been since i walked in , swiping a finger back and forth across her knee . newline newline  am i crazier than the rest ?  newline newline  i do nt know.  newline newline  well , did you already fix them all by now ?  newline newline  most.  newline newline  am i the most difficult one of them all ?  newline newline  i think so , based on my intuition of how this will go.  newline newline her finger stilled .  what makes me difficult for you ?  newline newline  i think you ve convinced yourself that no one will ever genuinely care about you , that no matter how hard you try to come back from this trauma , it will haunt you forever and keep everyone else distant . that s difficult to begin to overcome while i m being completely honest about myself.  newline newline she did nt reply . newline newline  has that answered your question sufficiently ?  newline newline  you should  she said , so softly i only caught the beginning . newline newline  pardon ?  newline newline  you should have lied to me.  newline newline her words brought silence , ticking on and on . the atmosphere did nt help with drowsiness , but i had had enough practice to keep myself awake . newline newline  why send someone who ca nt care to help someone who needs to feel cared for ?  she asked , a sudden end to the quiet . newline newline  i m not here to help . i m here to listen.  newline newline  what good does that do ?  newline newline she had already asked that , and i gave her the same answer .  a lot.  newline newline  what good does that do for me ?  newline newline  i do nt know yet.  newline newline  then why should i bother telling you anything ?  newline newline  it might help.  newline newline  i thought you were nt here to help ?  newline newline  a fortunate sideeffect , but it s not something i can promise.  newline newline  what can you promise , then ?  newline newline  i can promise to listen to anything you d like me to listen to.  newline newline her finger curled , so the trimmed nail pressed into her knee .  what if i do nt want to say anything ?  newline newline  that s fine.  newline newline  what if i tell you a ton of lies ?  newline newline  that s fine.  newline newline  what if i tell you really twisted , disgusting stuff ?  newline newline  that s fine.  newline newline  so anything s okay , huh ?  newline newline  as long as you want me to listen to it.  newline newline  what does that even mean ? what i want you to listen to ? is nt that just hearing what i say ?  newline newline  no , it means what it means . speaking might help some people , but , in my experience , speaking to someone helps more often . of course , you re free to say aloud whatever you like , but i m here to listen if there s anything you want to say to someone.  newline newline she did nt reply , and the silence settled in for a while once again . despite the time i had spent in the room , i had nt been able to use the moon to tell time , though i did nt even know if that was possible to do . i guessed it probably neared midnight , though . newline newline  i i do nt want any copout answer this time.  newline newline amongst the gloom , her face swirled , whatever she felt masked behind the darkness . newline newline  will telling you help me ?  newline newline i tried to see through the shadows and meet her gaze .  no , i do nt think so.  newline newline she did nt smile , or laugh , or look away from me .  will you listen anyway ?  newline newline  yes . i live a very good life . i have friends who enjoy me , a family that loves me , everything is right in its place ... everything , except for her . she left me 2 years ago and nothing can take her place . but beyond that i am well off . newline newline i am envious of those who do not have my life . those who have regular struggles , those who feel ... truly human . in a world where you have someone to share your struggles with while they can hold you and snuggle ... how can one find no comfort in that ? newline newline what good is happiness if it must be shared alone ? how will it feel when there is something that is not happiness ? the thought alone scares me ...love . what is life without love ? sacrifice . martyrdom . all for love . pain . suffering . worth every tear , every cry , every crimson droplet . all for love . not my sacrifice , of course , or my martyrdom , or my pain or my suffering or my tears , cries , or blood , even . no , my love is selfish , unclean , for i looked upon the face of my daughter for the first time twelve years ago and it was all that i could do to give her the world . so of course , as soon my lead scientist approached me with a new discovery that would surely monopolize the energy industry , i had no choice but to seize the opportunity . all for love . if i repeat it enough , maybe one day it  ll be true . newline i  ve never been a murderer . the factory workers , as i  ve still chosen to designated them even after the transition from nuclear energy , never die , not really . well , not often . of course , there s the occasional mishap , and sometimes limbs will be lost , but despite these blunders here and there , energy harvesting runs rather smoothly . the thing about pain as an energy source ? it  s efficient . extremely efficient . the morality of the process is a bit ambiguous at best , but it  s nothing that can  t be put aside for the right price . newline it  s not as if the workers don  t volunteer for this life . i pay them well . for every scream , every scar , they are rewarded handsomely . i  d be a fool to claim that it hurts me more than it hurts the men , women , and children in my service , but it does make me shudder to watch other human beings writhe in pain , strapped to sanitized iron tables , wires and tubes under their skin , pulsing , beating in their veins . this is why i don  t watch . rather , i sit in my office on the top floor half a mile above the underground factory and attempt to drown out the shouts of agony with soothing , classical music and the thought that for my family , at least , i am doing the right thing . newline my daughter must never know the truth . she  s a fragile soul , charitable and sweet and everything that i  m not . it would break her . no , i operate under the guise of the same old nuclear power plant that i ran not a year ago , just beyond the reach of the american government , always one step ahead . if i should get caught , i would lose everything . my daughter would lose everything . but anything for love , right ? all for love .he met his match inside her golden gaze newline newline as those born into cages seldom find . newline newline brightcrested chaffinch , ruffling wings amaze , newline newline where his , inside his cage , would neer unwind . newline newline newline she met his moves through bright coquettish bobs : newline newline the dance of kindred souls caged up in twain ! newline newline but every move , so clear ? and now it robs newline newline his heart to think his longing s been in vain . newline newline newline but no ! he fights the door , bold beak and claw newline newline and watches as his sweetheart s lock s undone . newline newline they re freed ! and now , at last both fly , in awe , newline newline to meet each other : shooting stars made one . newline newline and , happy , his free spirit found her gaze , newline newline as broke and still neath panes his body lay .sun warden soliaen had nt believed the rumors until he saw the monster for himself . it looked unsettlingly like one of his own race , but it was shorter , stockier , clumsier . uglier . it was like a cruel mockery of the fey . newline newline newline the monster had appeared sometime during the midsummer celebration  no one had witnessed its arrival , but there were signs that it had strolled blithely into a pisky s garden without permission and eaten some of the fruit which grew there . the sight of bare footprints crossing the boundary glyphs without hesitation had chilled soliaen to his core . this should nt be possible .  newline newline newline the trespass had occurred during the final six hours of noon , so the monster was immediately thought to be a member of the sun caste  members of the moon caste began a search the moment that midnight began that evening . after several hours , they d found it lounging by a pond belonging to the mer , eating from a bundle of grapes and regarding the night sky . even deep into midnight , it was wide awake . newline newline newline the moon caste party had silently surrounded the monster before it took notice . the party leader had attempted to speak to the creature and , astonishingly , it spoke the same language . newline newline newline  trespasser !  the monster leapt to its feet as the moon warden called out . the sudden motion made the rest of the encircling party jerk backwards , revealing their position to the creature . the moon warden managed to keep his position , and carefully calmed his nerves before continuing . newline newline newline  we wish to parley  for our mutual protection , will you swear to remain where you are while we converse ?  the confidence in the moon warden s voice steeled the rest of search party . newline newline newline  um , yes , ok . i promise i ll stay here while we talk if you promise not to hurt me .  even the monster s voice was ugly , lacking all the music which conveyed intelligence and culture . even its bargain was flawed . what s more , the monster s eyes darted about to the nowapparent fey encircling it . it was obviously cowed somewhat by the forces arrayed against it . the search party s confidence grew . newline newline newline  i promise that i will not harm you , if you stay where you are while we speak .  the moon warden gave a lithe signal with his hand . two young fey approached the monster from either side , and drew twin semicircles around it with salt , each ending where their counterpart s started to form a perfect , unbroken circle . they sang a brief spell and the salt emitted a silvery glow to signify the barrier was in place . newline newline newline  now , trespasser , of which caste are you ?  the moon warden began . newline newline newline  i m sorry , i do nt know what you mean . we do nt really have casts in my country , and i do nt really know where i am right now .  newline newline newline the moon warden frowned at the barrier . it remained a perfect silver : there was no distortion to indicate that an untruth had been spoken during parley . the monster was apparently speaking the truth . matters were complicated somewhat by the monster s apparent lack of any aura whatsoever , a typical trait for dumb beasts , but not something one would expect from a creature capable of speach . newline newline newline  what are you ?  the moon warden thought aloud , changing it into a question as he spoke . newline newline newline  well , i m a human ... male ... american , if that means anything to you . can you tell me where i am ?  the barrier remained unblemished as the monster spoke . it belied its foolishness in the final question : it asked whether an answer could be provided , rather than asking for the answer itself . newline newline newline the moon warden simply said  yes , i could ,  and smiled . this creature was obviously nothing more than some dumb animal , and the sun caste citizens had been panicking over nothing . he made another quick gesture with his hands , and the rest of the party drew their glass swords and began to approach the beast . newline newline newline  hey , man , you promised you would nt hurt me if i stayed here , and i have nt been moving   the monster began nervously . newline newline newline the moon warden replied smugly .  yes . i wo nt be hurting you . i   newline newline newline  oh fuck this bullshit .  the monster interrupted , raising its hands defensively as it stepped backwards out of the salt circle , scuffing it in the process . the silver light of the barrier winked out immediately . the monster seemed not to notice in the slightest . newline newline newline everyone froze . the beast had broken its own bargain , and simultaneously destroyed a barrier without the slightest effort . newline newline newline  i do nt want to hurt anyone , but i will defend myself if you make me ,  the monster continued , completely oblivious to what it had done . the entire search party fled immediately , some dropping their weapons as they did . the moon warden himself only managed to hold his ground for an instant before terror overwhelmed him . impossible ... impossible ,  the thought echoed through his mind as he ran as fast as his legs would carry him . newline newline newline that was two days ago . since then , the monster has helped itself to gardens and orchards on a whim , and repeatedly approached citizens of each caste  common and noble alike . the sun warden had personally watched the creature stride through ancient wards as if they were spider webs . no , less than webs . it was completely unaware of their existence ,  the sun warden pondered as he worked . newline newline newline he watched the monster sitting beside a lake , its head in its hands as it wept softly . even when putting on a show of sorrow , the beast had no discernable aura . it s a trick of some sort . nothing with emotion lacks an aura .  newline newline newline the sun warden slowly and carefully worked the many latches of the silver chest before him . within the chest was a smaller chest and a gauntlet , each made of pure diamond . the warden s brow began to bead with sweat . he had never heard of this vile weapon actually being used since the final war . but they needed it now . he opened the diamond chest . within lay the allslayer s blade , suspended by spidersilk with its point aimed perfectly downward . newline newline newline it was sharp , but crude , as the material was exceptionally rare and universally fatal . even crafting the blade had cost the lives of over a dozen fey . the sun warden donned the gauntlet and carefully drew the blade . even with the gauntlet , it was very unlikely he would survive wielding the blade for more than a few moments . he turned his head away from it , took a deep breath , and charged from his hiding spot . newline newline newline  newline newline newline the human started at the sudden explosion of movement from the bushes . one of the locals was sprinting at him with some kind of crude iron knife  it looked prehistoric , and laughably shoddy compared to the beautifully crafted glass swords he d seen previously . newline newline newline the local screamed as he charged , and the usual grace the human had come to expect from these people was somewhat undercut by his strange stance : he kept his face turned away from the blade as if it had a foul smell , or was radioactive . the human managed to grab the local s wrist and wrench it in a maneuver that would ve been impossible if the local had been watching where it was going . newline newline newline the knife clattered to the ground , and the human shoved the other being away . the locals were very swift and agile , but they did nt have much weight to them . the human picked up the knife and examined it while the local stared , dumbfounded . upon closer inspection , it was definitely just a solid iron knife . newline newline newline the local had managed to knick the human s upper arm in the brief scuffle , but the cut was so shallow as to ve barely broken the skin . the human wiped away the thin spotting of blood with his shirtsleeve , and tucked the knife into his belt before turning back to the being who d attacked him . newline newline newline  the fuck is wrong with you people ? !  he shouted at the wildeyed local who was frantically scrabbling backward away from him .  i just needed directions !  newline newlinearms wrapped behind the metal bars of the stacking chair , tied with fraying ropes and a gleaming silver lock . the plastic package took a rest in the trash nearby . bright . one light overhead with a dinner plate rim , and the man tied sighed . newline newline the tier  s higher . bloody bits of rope rest the floor and he paces around the chair , almost skipping . okay , he  s skipping . to the man in the chair the antagoniser is skipping , but remember , he  s lost a lot of blood . newline newline the sorry deluded watches to the other , and he says to themother : i  m going to miss me when you  re gone .harold is my one true love always has been and always will be . newline newline in the winter , our tiny town s streets were so caked with ice and snow that driving was impossible , walking only slightly less so . yet harold made the trek to my house , 3 miles away , to take care of me during a major storm when i was too ill to get out of my bed . he waited on me hand and foot , even when i whined , and even when i vomited so hard that i blacked out . is it any wonder that i fell in love ? newline newline for months afterwords , we flirted , we hugged , we spent most of our spare time together . not that it was any different than before i fell ill but now i was aware of it . i knew that he was waiting for my signal , any signal , to dump his shrew of a girlfriend . yet i hesitated . i was so worried to tell him how i felt , worried i would lose my best friend . newline newline it was a hot summer day when he asked me to meet him on a stone bench outside of the library because he had something important to tell me . if i d known what was about to happen , i would have put on waterproof mascara . if i d known what was about to happen , i would nt have gone . newline newline he was in love with her , you see . the shrew . had asked her to marry him  she d said yes , of course  and now he wanted me to be his best man , well , best woman . i wanted to scream , to talk him out of it , but one look at his face and i knew . so i told him yes , smiled and hugged him . then i went home and cried until my dehydrated body could no longer produce tears . newline newline in their wedding , i was the best best woman i could be . i made sure everything went off without a hitch , gave the most epic speech i could manage . dead inside , but somehow still walking . and i hugged them both and wished them well as they left for their honeymoon . newline newline what else could i do ? she made him happy , she was what he wanted . should you not give your love their every desire , even when seeing them together steals the air from your lungs ? newline newline though he will never know , harold is my one true love always has been and always will be . oh , ah hey master evil.  newline newline  um , hi there captain lightningbolt.  newline

his family , saw his depressed wife and his two boys , shaking uncontrollably . newline newline  we can make it ... come on , the streets are clear . i promise you , phil take us somewhere safe .  the man said , stepping out into the street . his family slowly stepped out , and they began making their way towards their destination . the man looked down at his arm , and pushed his sleeve over the numbers engraved on his arm . newline newline across the silent town newline newline  we re only a hour away !  the man exclaimed happily . it was his day off as an officer , so he decided to spend his time with his family . his wife sat in the passenger seat of the car , and his two boys sat in the backseat . newline newline  where ?  the boys asked . they were alive with excitement , usually shifting in their seats . newline newline the man looked over to his wife and smiled .  to your uncle phil s house ! basic training day 1 , camp mcintyre newline newline dear estelle , newline i know

kisses and hugs , newline jack it  s you again.  nerissa leans on the railing , fingers grasping it tightly . newline newline  the same to you , hare.  isidore snorts , looking away just to pull her hair up into a long ponytail . newline newline  quit calling me by that stupid nickname , tortoise.  nerissa sneers , continuing to look out at the city in front of them . newline newline  it fits you.  isidore turns and places her back to the city to look at nerissa , crossing her arms as smoke curls upward from her cigarette .  if you  re here though , it must mean something important is going to happen.  a slight smirk plays across isidore  s lips .  what is it this time ? an assassination ? someone being elected ? an explosion ?  she reaches up , taking the cancer stick from her mouth and flicking the ashes off the end . newline newline nerissa  s scowl falls away as she stares out at the city . she stays silent , continuing to watch as she touches a spot on her wrist , activating a small barrier close to her skin . a small shimmer across the body suit she  s already wearing indicates that it  s in use , making isidore raise an eyebrow at the other woman . newline newline  usually you  re not so silent , hare . all that jumping through time get you confused as to where you are ?  isidore looks out over the city over her shoulder , taking another long drag off the cigarette . newline newline  i know exactly where i am , tortoise.  nerissa finally replies after a lengthy silence . a cry goes up from the city , the wail of a loud siren . the sound of airplanes is finally heard . newline newline  what  s so important about this little city ? why are you here to watch it destroyed , little hare ?  isidore looks up at the sky , tracing the path of the planes . the two lapse into silence , quietly picking their points of observation . newline newline  i  m here to watch the destruction of my hometown.  nerissa finally states as the bombs fall from the sky .  and remembering the terrible reasoning as to why behind it.  the explosion rocks the area but nerissa doesn  t move , staring as the town is engulfed by fire . isidore is caught midgape , staring at her and is flung away from the railing . newline newline the flames and explosion are impressive , flung upwards and outwards at a size impressive despite the close distance . isidore screams as she  s burned and irradiated at the same time . nerissa keeps her eyes on the city however , her suit protecting her . slowly , the fire dies away as isidore writhes on the ground in pain . nerissa steps over to her , looking down at her with a rather blank expression . newline newline  how could you be born here ? how ?  isidore stares up at her with one good eye as the other begins to regenerate . nerissa gives a grimace of a smile , more teeth shown than not , much like isidore  s current facial expression save that hers is by choice . newline newline  spoilers.  a low chuckle comes from nerissa .  wouldn  t want me to spoil the future for you , would you ?  isidore sneers as best she can around her face slowly fixing itself . newline newline  come on.  newline newline  i can not .  nerissa waves to isidore .  see you next time.  energy swallows her , a rift closing around her and isidore is left in the ruins of what had been a small park near the outskirts of the town , still regenerating . newline newline  fucking bitch.  isidore spits blood to the side as she lays her head back , waiting for her legs to heal enough so that she can get to her feet . as she does so , the ground scorches her now bare feet , the shoes having been simply melted away along with much of her clothing . isidore looks out across the destroyed town before starting to limp away with a scowl on her face .  could  ve warned me , the hair takes forever to grow back . looking in one the small room i could see her , the one woman who i had trusted with all of my knowledge , the one who had betrayed me for her  country.   launch at china first.  i wrote down a reminder on a piece of paper in front of me her home country would be the test to see if my space station was up to the task , china was also most likely to be my biggest adversary as the u.s had been in ruin ever since the 2032 elections . i walked over to the elevator , pushed the button to the 15th floor and began my long ride up to see her one more time , she would get to watch the world burn with me just as i always told her we  d get to do together though it wasn  t exactly the way i had envisioned it . the elevator door beep sounding that i had arrived , as the doors opened i saw her she sat there glaring at me in what i assumed had been anger .  what  s wrong my dear ? did i take too long for you ?  i asked her , she didn  t reply her eyes just locked onto mine my spine shivered as i stared back at her , was this fear ? i thought to myself before looking away out the window of my station .  i bet you  re wondering how i managed to do all of this without anyone ever knowing my true intention aren  t you ?  i asked her , still nothing out of this woman this vile wretched woman who betray me for what a sense of duty , i shrugged off the thought and stroked her hair gently .  it was simple . see while the u.n had agreed to help fund this station and i did use their money to build it i also had planned for much , much more.   shove it up your ass you fuck.  she said interrupting me .  oh my cecilia what a mouth you have , maybe this will help you hold that tongue of yours !  i shouted as she was electrocuted before me , it wasn  t enough to kill anyone but it would cause severe pain . newline newline newline  now my dear why don  t you let me finish . i even get to keep my promise to you about seeing the fire spread throughout the world . we can begin a new chapter in humanity , one without war , or ignorance , no more racism or hatred !  i said , i tried to sound caring sincere .  like i  d wan na see that kinda world . besides a psycho like you would never be able to rule !  she spat back at me ,  i did all of this for us ! for you !  i shouted back at her , i removed my hand from her hair and walked away to the window trying to regain my composure i couldn  t let her see me like this especially not now in my moment of triumph .  i did this for us , for me and you . we could be together forever my love , with a whole world to look after . we could be the gods of religions everywhere ! think of the progress that would be made ! think of the power !  i said . i began to laugh , i couldn  t believe i had finally done it finally won , and there would be no more resistance to me now .  i have installed the kinetic rods and their tipped with enough uranium to make hiroshima and nagasaki look like a walk in the park ! no one will ever stand before me after today ! and you ! you have provided me with the perfect target to test my fully operational battle station !  i knew that line from somewhere and i had always wanted to use it .  so you  re quoting old movies now.  she laughed back at me . that was the last time i saw her smile .  i may be but do not underestimate my power !  i shouted , my hand slammed down on the console pushing the big red button . i could see them , my rods of death painted with skull and crossbones falling towards china . i checked off in my head that i had completed my todo list for the day and looked back at my dear cecilia , her face made the moment priceless watching one  s country be wiped off the map would do that to someone i supposed .  now then my love . i  m afraid this is where we part ways . i hope that our time together was precious to you as it was me . who knows maybe , maybe one day i  ll find someone who  s as special as you again.  i said to her , i turned toward the elevator when i heard that wretched sound her laughing always drove me mad . newline newline newline i turned back to see her sitting there laughing .  what  s so funny ?  i asked , she just continued to laugh . after a little while her laughter subsided and she looked over her shoulder , she couldn  t see me but she tried so hard .  you really are stupid.  she said , how , what had i done wrong .  really ? my plan was perfect . i used your precious u.n money to build a battle station to reshape the world in my image ! i spent years building my fortune ! years ! i started countless civil wars in dozens of countries , i rigged elections of hundreds more , i covertly snuck aboard this station all those loyal to me , and i snuck aboard my warheads !  i snapped back at her remark , i wasn  t stupid all of what i had done took years of planning .  how ! how am i stupid ?  i shouted at her .  you fell in love.  she simply replied back , i looked at her i knew she was right but i couldn  t admit that to her she started a station wide rebellion and caused millions in damages i had to fix .  love won  t save you.  i responded in a cold voice . i turned back and went into the elevator pushing the button to head back down to the 5th floor where my office was located .  soon it will be over.  i kept saying to myself ,  all you have to do is hit the airlock for the room , she won  t feel a thing.  i reassured myself . three hours had passed as i sat there staring at the button to open the airlock . newline newline newline  i apologize for any grammar mistakes i m really bad with using comma s .  part 1  newline newline the rural countryside really was quite striking . beautiful , rolling green hills , a sleepy little town , nestled in the comforting arms of a small valley . there was even a main street that ran through the center of the town . kind of a cross between a norman rockwell painting and your typical small college town . vermont , he thought to himself , stepping off the bus at the station . definitely like upstate vermont . he took a deep breath and savored the brisk , clear air . it was miles better than the constant smoke and smell of sulfur of the main campus of the academy , he thought . whatever mad genius who decided to build the academy under the site of a freaking active volcano should be dragged out in the middle of the street and shot . preferably in front of his family and loved ones . newline newline the young man straightened his black jacket and hefted his backpack on his shoulders . he had been traveling for several hours at that point , not under the best of conditions . first was the supersonic hydrofoil ride from the academy dock to the airport . then an 8 hour flight in the hold of a converted military transport plane , strapped in an uncomfortable seat to the cargo netting . then an additional 4 hour bus ride to this sleepy little town . stretching , he luxuriated in being able to reach out and not immediately touch another living being . he took another deep breath and exhaled loudly and audibly . seriously . it was really nice here . he started walking down from the bus station towards the center of town . newline newline minutes later , he found himself in front of a small coffee shop right off the main street . sandwiched between some brownstone and brick buildings , the plate glass window facing the street showed into what looked to be a cozy sitting area . he could see the corner of a small stage , covered in white christmas lights , and some mismatched tables and chairs . there were a couple of people sitting at the tables , drinking out of oversized and colorful mugs and teacups . as he made his way to the door , he could see flyers plastering the door and alcove . he stopped and looked at them curiously . colorful sheets , advertising everything from open mic nights and poetry slams to support group information and piano lessons , all competing for his attention as a tapestry of small town activity . the door suddenly opened to the sound of a jingling bell , and a pair of young girls came out , laughing . he could smell an intoxicating blend of fresh coffee and pastries beckoning to him from inside as he made his way inside . newline newline  how can i help you ,  asked the shorthaired barista in front of him . he looked up at the large chalkboard above the counter , hand drawn and lettered in chalk . there was a large , copper espresso machine cheerfully burbling away next to them . a burst of steam hissed out , followed by the clanging of metal pitchers . the man stroked his chin in contemplation . newline newline  can i get a cappuccino ?  he asked finally . the barista smiled , nodded and immediately set to work . the man watched her as she worked . she was very efficient as she worked , no wasted movements . each step , flowing into the next . newline newline  what kind of milk ?  newline newline  i m sorry , what ?  newline newline  what kind of milk ? for the cappuccino ?  she asked , pausing for the first time since she started the order . the young man started , embarrassed for holding her up . newline newline  ah , sorry . whole milk is fine ,  he answered hastily . newline newline  nice . living dangerously . i like it  she cracked a smile . she immediately poured the milk into the pitcher and started cranking the knob on the antique machine to adjust the steam . the machine complained at first , but soon found it s voice and a creamy aroma filled the air , accompanied by the squeal steam escaping the small metal wand . the barista stared at the pitcher , her one hand on the knob , the other holding the pitcher by the handle , but with her fingertips just touching the base . suddenly , without warning , she cranked the knob and the machine sputtered to a stop . turning , she poured the pitcher into what looked like a large yellow teacup with a faded daisy on the side . newline newline  here you go . enjoy ,  she said , and turned back to the machine , wiping it down . the young man stared at the top of the cup . there was an beautifully drawn leaf in the foam . he started to say something to the barista , but she had already moved down the counter on another errand . he carefully balanced the filled to the brim cup and made his way across the worn , wood floor to one of the tables in the window . newline newline sitting and enjoying his first sip of the smooth cappuccino , he pulled out his academy assigned tablet and logged in . a large , crimson sigil blazed to life on the screen , then faded as he brought up his email . there was a waiting message in his inbox . he clicked on the icon , and looked over the missive . newline newline assignment : prepare for world domination .  newline newline welcome to hamiltonia . this is your practical exam to see if you have absorbed and processed the information

newline the young man let out a slow breath . he stared at the email on his tablet for a few minutes longer , reading it over again . the encryption key attached to the email blinked cheerfully . he took a sip of his cooling cappuccino and brooded . he had always been good at brooding . newline newline  so you re the latest , eh ?  chuckled an old man , sitting at another table . another old man sitting at the same table snorted derisively , and turned the page of his newspaper , pointedly ignoring them . both men were dressed in matching plaid shirts , one red , the other green . the man who had started talking first chuckled and waved a hand dismissively at the other . newline newline  do nt mind him . so you re the latest one , eh ? come to subjugate  and conquer  us , eh ?  he asked . newline newline the young man looked back warily . was he being tested already ? he tried to remember what his instructors had said about first contact with a possibly hostile enemy population . never head straight along into conflict . especially with a force of unknown strength . infiltrate . observe . gather information .  newline newline  end part 1 it was the typical tuesday afternoon at joe s , jamie , the bartender , was methodically wiping down the bar with a yellow wash clothe , that steven was sure was white at some point in time . like the wash cloth , steven s life had been stained by the stench of cheep booze . steven sat alone , as usual , at the center of the bar , that stretched from the entrance to the back corner . he was 47 now , and looked closer to 60 . he had thinning grey hair that was just short of shoulder length , and a scraggly beard that matched his unkempt lifestyle . he wore an aged leather bomber jacket , full of old military patches coming unsewn along his back . and a hat that was embroidered with uss nimitz on his head . his drink of choice ? whatever his post lunch rush begging could get him . usually cheap rum . newline newline it had nt always been this way for steven . he used to be a pilot in the navy . a damn good pilot at that . he flew the ea6b prowlers , his call sign ,  swillz  , was still his name of choice . newline newline  you want another , swillz ?  jamie asked from across the bar . newline newline  i suppose i ll have just one more ,  swillz said ,  i m getting too damn old to be out in the cold all day anyway .  newline newline jamie poured another glass full of the brown nectar that swillz clung to , as another gentleman entered the bar . he was dressed in all black . black pants , black shoes , black shirt and a black trench coat draped down his back , floor length . even his hair was jet black and well kept . his cheeks were red and windburn by the breeze that chicago was famous for . the man took off his coat and placed it on the back of the barstool to the left of swillz . newline newline  hi , what ll be ?  jamie asked . newline newline  whatever he s having ,  replied the man with sadness in his voice ,  not in a mood to be picky .  newline newline  rough day ?  asked jamie . newline newline  you could say that ,  said the man looking down st the bar ,  lost my job . been working for the same guy longer than you ve probably been alive so i guess it was nt my best day .  newline newline  sorry to hear that ,  jamie said . although she knew that could nt be true , the man , looked all of 25 and jamie was well into her 30s . she shot swillz a look that said  keep this looney bin occupied for me , and i ll put the next round on the house . swillz nodded in agreement . newline newline  got ta name ?  swillz raspy voice echoed in the empty bar . newline newline  jerry ,  said the man reaching out to shake hands ,  how are you ?  newline newline  i think we ve both seen better days , jerry ,  replied swillz .  i m , steven , but everyone calls me , swillz .  newline newline  nice to meet you , swillz .  jerry said as he took the hard water stained glass from the bar in front of him and took it all down in one gulp .  another please , sweetheart .  newline newline he looked at swillz up and down , studying the old man ,  so , you look like a man who s in need of a good job .  newline newline  so do you .  said swillz angrily . newline newline jerry leaned in close to swillz and said ,  grim reaper is looking for a new protg , you interested ?  newline newline swillz eyes widened as he looked at jerry , puzzled and disturbed by the question . newline newline  now before you start thinking i m crazy i can prove this offer is legitimate .  jerry said snapping his fingers . newline newline swillz heard the ticking of the clock on the wall come to a screeching stop . the silence that now filled the room was as intrusive as jerry .  you see jamie at the end of the bar ?  jerry asked  she s my last job , and i have chosen you to replace me .  newline newline swillz looked over at jamie , she was frozen in place on a stepping stool behind the bar .  wh.. what s happening ?  swillz squeaked . newline newline  do nt be alarmed ,  jerry said ,  all men must die . you know this to be true . it s jamie s time . her doctor told her to quit smoking years ago . she should have listened .  newline newline  she s my only friend in this world .  swillz said , holding back the tears . newline newline  i know ,  jerry replied ,  precisely the reason you have been chosen . after jamie here goes into cardiac arrest , you will have no one . making you the perfect candidate .  newline newline  i m not a murderer !  swillz could no longer choke down his tears . newline newline  really ?  jerry said gravely .  you had no problem dropping 1000 pound bombs over the middle east , you had no problem getting behind the wheel after drinking all night at your post deployment party . i believe a child of 4 and her mother were the victims who decided to cross the street at the wrong time . you had the wits to report the car stolen and torch it in an ally though , you did .  newline newline swillz was in shock . his jaw dropped in disbelief .  i ... i ... i did nt mean to .  he said looking into the eyes of what he was learning was no man ,  i suppose i wo nt have a choice in this matter , will i ? newline newline  oh there s always a choice , steven ,  said jerry ,  but if you say no  i have to warn you that hell is a real place , and you ve punched a one way ticket .  newline newline jerry reached over the bar and gently touched jamie s hand .  when i snap my fingers , jamie will collapse and i will be gone . you will have no memory of me being here . what s your answer ?  newline newline  i ll do it .  swillz said gravely . newline newline  good choice .  jerry said with a chuckle . newline newline jerry snapped his fingers and they were gone . the clock on the wall began to tick as jamie s limp body fell to the sticky floor . newline newlinei spammed the backspace button on my keyboard for the seventh time in the last hour . character by character , my lede disappeared , lost forever . it did nt matter  it was nt a good lede anyway . newline newline newline in fact , that seemed to be the problem i was having . no matter what i typed , what angle i tried to approach the story from , i just could nt find a good way of doing it . maybe the job was really beginning to wear on me . maybe years of media manipulation , purposely spinning the horrible things politicians did was finally taking its toll . newline newline newline from the time i was a little boy , i d always wanted to be a journalist . i was the only 7th grader in my class  or , being honest for a second , anywhere  watching not only the nightly news at 5 , the one with sandra macintosh and lance beemer , but also the world report that immediately followed . by the time i was in high school , i d already started my own community paper , reporting on the local town happenings and high school sports . i even started a politics section covering the town council . if the new york times had it , so too did the lake willow reader . newline newline newline in addition to writing for and editing the paper , high school was also the time i fell in love with politics . during sophomore year , i ran for student council and devoured every book i could on government . by junior year , no one knew as much about the current presidential race , including some of the teachers . along with reporting , it was my passion . newline newline newline once i d gone to college , my path was clear . i was going to be a reporter . but not the kind that wrote about meaningless games on sunday or gave three out of four stars because , my god , what a performance by oscar mcacademy in his careerdefining role . no , i was going to write about the things that really mattered . about governance and campaigns and politics  about the people who ran the world . the day i graduated , i got an offer for my dream job . newline newline newline a big time city paper was over the moon about my resume . a lifetime of writing , combined with the gogetter qualities present in the kind of kid producing his own paper in junior high , gave me the edge over my competition . i was hired immediately for their washington division and moved within the week . newline newline newline the first three years were a magical . i interviewed the biggest people in american government and i covered the biggest events . i hobnobbed with the political elite at their fundraisers and party events . rapidly , i rose through the ranks at the paper and before i knew it , went from walking the beat on the hill to sitting in a corner office , making more money that i should have to write my own opinions . my editorials garnered enough attention to be featured front and center on the politics section on more than one occasion . newline newline newline then everything changed . the paper was sold and within a week , the new ownership changed everything . it was impressed upon us , particularly the editorial staff , that our personal views were no longer our professional views . sure , we still had the freedom to write how we wanted , but what we wrote was going to be dictated straight from the top . it did nt matter how we voted , what we told out friends , or what our voter registration card said  all that mattered was that when we published in the paper , we were supporting only one party . there was no money in honesty and objectivity would get you canned . newline newline newline this revolted me at first and i thought long and hard about leaving entirely . but i could nt afford it . my divorce was taking a toll on my bank account and , despite my meteoric rise through the newspaper , i was still relatively new in the industry . and the new owner had the influence and resources to make sure i started over writing police blotters . so , like my newspaper , i sold out . newline newline newline it was hard at first , to trade my journalistic integrity for money , but the larger the numbers on the check got , the easier it became . newline newline newline over the next several years , i became washington s master of spin . there was nt anything that i could nt shine just the right light on to make acceptable . something about being an genuinely objective person and always attempting to see both sides of an issue that made spin easy . political shills could nt do it  they never came off honest enough . their arguments would be riddled with obvious bias and more attacks than facts . but my points , owing to the fact that i could look at both sides of an issue , had a subtle elegance about them . i could make the other side look foolish and weak but still retain enough credibility to be believable . i was dangerous . newline newline newline corporate corruption , like politicians being in bed with oil companies , became good men who cared enough about their constituents to make sure gas prices did nt destroy cashstrapped families . hawkish foreign policy was protecting our values , being tough on security , and having the stomach to make tough decisions when needed , which the other side surely would nt do . and the constant call to reign in civil liberties was veiled as family values , keeping our country right with god , and upholding what it meant to be a patriotic american . newline newline newline people ate it up . it was scarily simple . before long , people were citing my columns in arguments at the bar or debates on cnn . hell , once or twice , a sitting politician cited me on the congressional floor to support his next big pork project . i knew it was all bullshit . but i was making great money and my name meant something . i justified it by saying that people could still make their own decision , that i was nt responsible , it was the paper forcing me . at first , i slept at night . newline newline newline but it was nt long before that small voice in me , the spark that pushed me down this path from childhood , the one part of me that knew what it meant to be a real journalist grew to a roaring flame . i struggled with it for a long time . newline newline newline it exploded into something undeniable the night i accepted my award for journalistic excellence . when they announced my name , a moment that should have filled me with joy instead filled me with nausea . i avoided laughing hysterically during my acceptance speech only be the grace of god . the minute i was home , the award went into the back of a closet , it s resting place to this day . that night , i did nt sleep well . newline newline newline so here i was , trying to do my job like always , but i could nt . nothing i wrote was good . nothing i wrote was even coherent . and the only explanation could be that i d finally had enough . enough of the dishonesty , enough of the spin , enough of the moral bankruptcy . it was time to tell the truth . newline newline newline what this man had done could nt be spun . the people had to know what really happened . they had to know what this man was capable of . it was nt manners or social graces that had pushed him to do this , as i would have probably written just a week ago . this was purely , blatantly unamerican . newline newline newline slowly , with great effort , like my fingers were nt used to writing with such honesty , i began to type . soon though , they loosened and blazed across the keyboard , as the freedom of truth shaved off the rust . it was as if i was trying to make up for nearly a decade of hackneyed journalism with one article . maybe that was unrealistic , but by god , i was going to try . newline newline newline the next day , my column ran on the front page of the paper . but it was nt my paper . i submitted my column to our crosstown rivals who jumped at the chance to run such a devastating antiparty piece with my byline on it . it was my first front page article . in big bold letters , painted across every newsstand in the city , it read : newline newline newline newline presidential candidate eats pizza with fork and knife !  newline newline newline newline i breathed a sigh of relief . my conscious was clear . it was done . newline newline newline as it turns out , so was i. i was fired that afternoon . newline newline newline i walked out of that office with my head held high . there were a lot of things you could get away with . crony capitalism , getting rich off the backs of the american public , even destroying civil liberties were one thing . but no one , and i mean no one should ever be allowed to eat pizza with a fork and knife .hi . newline my name is hickey . newline i m a cat . but i m not a regular cat as you humans might think . newline i am here to watch and protect my owner  , but i failed . and this is my story . newline newline i remember the day when i was a young recruit of the pgo , the pet guardian organization . the day of my graduation i was being chosen for some canadian man , who lived in the woods . newline he was a lumberjack , alone and everything . he had almost no friends and was really alone . general paws , a labrador , thought that i d be the greatest choice to guard our lone friend . newline newline i was pretty anxious , i could nt help myself . i mean , i was pretty much thrown into the cold water . newline usually we recruits , you humans call us kittens , cubs and whatnot , get deployed in groups somewhere on the earth and usually it s our duty to stay in pairs , but this case was not normal . newline my man was somehow special . general paws did not tell me , that this human was about to save the world one day . newline newline anyways , i was deployed in the canadian woods , and kittengod damn , this place was cold as fuck . everybody knows , that we cats do nt like the cold . we like to stay warm , lying in front of the oven , but general paws did not care . newline so i was thrown out of the chopper and landed into the ice cold snow . out of anger i started swearing around and look ! i was found by him . newline he thought it was a coincidence , but it was nt . he was so alone that he did nt even think about it , he just took me with him . newline newline and there we were , in his shady log cabin he probably built by himself . he opened the door , it was nt even locked or something , and we entered the house . finally some warm , cozy feeling came around me when i saw the burning furnace . his interior was rather spartanic , he had a table with two chairs , one bed , a sofa and a clothing cabinet . it was nt much , actually . newline newline over the years i got used to this lifestyle . i mean , i got everything i need . he even killed some wolf and prepared his fur for me so i could use it to sleep in front of the furnace . and the food was alright , too . yet i got the feeling that i could not stop eating , since it was so cold and i needed my nutrition . i guess that was the only point he hated about me , that he had to feed me all the times . newline newline one day , when i was pondering in my thoughts about that undercover task i was into , i heard a knock at the door . but who could that be ? my protege was sleeping and as far as i knew he did nt have much friends . i decided to open the door and nearly died from an heart attack , when i saw that dwarf standing in front of the door . newline newline this grimm , frostbitten dwarf with his long , red beard was nt too happy to see me . i knew what he was here for . he wanted to kill my protege . dwarfs hate it , when human roam around in their liars , and my man did that . newline we engaged into a fight , and it was pretty tough . the dwarf knew how to use his axe but i was trained by the pgo and was able to fight him off . we smashed the kitchen and my protege would nt be to happy about that . and he was nt . newline newline my man got some weird habit .  he used to feel his pulse every morning .   https : www.reddit.comrwritingpromptscomments3vxau8wpyouinstinctivelycheckyourpulseevery  but one evening he came home and he already looked sick . i knew something was wrong , but i did nt know what . at the next morning , when he felt his pulse , there was none . and i knew , that i fucked it up . i watched him bursting through his cabin door and could not help him . newline newline general paws would be damn mad at me .everyone in my world had different eye colours.each representing a different element.i was one of them.however , i was one of the unusual ones . newline ever since i was born , i had completely black eyes.my parents were shocked.the doctors could nt explain anything , not even the institute of magic could.no one ever had completely dark eyes.i m not

an honest answer.personally , i never thought much of it.until 2 days ago ... . newline october 5th , the day of my birthday.i wake up as usual..and strangely , i felt like a new person.nothing strange about that , the elders would always tell me that was how they felt.its 7:15am,15 minutes until the ritual of the ancients began.i needed to hurry.as i ran through the neighbourhood ... i felt a strange sensation.everything seems to be in my control ... as if i could bend somethings life force until it broke ... newline suddenly , i felt a chilling sensation.everything had gone quiet , the birds did not tweet , i did not feel the wind , everything had stopped.something or someone was here.i spun around.and there stood a hooded figure , in the streets.the figure started to walk up towards me.my instincts screamed at me to run , but my feet were stuck to the ground . newline it s ok niko.i wo nt hurt you , but i do nt have much time .  newline newline who are you ?  newline newline come , let s walk .  newline newline he led me to a part of trees , with leaves scattered all over the ground , and dead branches where the eyes could see . newline newline crunch crunch crunch newline newline today is the day you reach 18 and get your new powers .  newline newline tell me something i do nt know .  newline newline that s not the point.have you ever wondered why your

newline newline no one knows my father.people said he just , disappeared , one day.poof.that was it  newline newline i was the one who gave him his power.and the power got passed down to you.come on , boy , do you really believe in those lies ?  newline newline what if my father had the power to ... no ... no that ca nt be , its just not possible.they only appear 1 time in a 1000 years ... newline newline the power to leech life and end the life of others , boy .  newline newline he finished the thing he was folding , and in his hand held a paper scythe . newline newline ddeath ? i was terrified by now . newline newline took you long enough.i do nt have much time now.but mark my words.do not go to the ritual , if they find out ... .they ll do the same thing to your father .  newline newline he snapped his fingers and a pen made of bone popped in his hand.he ripped a piece of paper from the air , wrote something , and passed it to me . newline newline take this , follow where it goes.and when you find them ... .tell me i sent you.if the institute does nt kill you , you live as an outcast.stay away from here .  newline newline i had no time to question anything , at that moment , he disappeared.and as if i was having a dream , i woke up just where i was before i saw him . newline newline i understood what i had to do.i ran home , grabbed everything i had , and ran as far away from weston city as possible . newline newline they might have taken my dad , but not me , no . newline if i were to survive , i will need to leave my previous life behind ... .thomas hendricks was excited . no , that would be an understatement . thomas hendricks was ecstatic . he was over the moon . his every exhalation resounded with joy as he bounded across the oxford campus green . newline newline thomas had made it . it had taken him years of diligent study , all those long nights in the library , rarely a moment to himself , to sleep , to bathe , to eat . that all changed today . he d finally made it . he had passed all the tests , aced the practical exam , he d even come out of that strange medical exam with flying colors . nothing could bring thomas down today , as he trod purposefully up the great granite steps to the h. bosworth biology building . he was off to meet the great doctor reginald bosworth the 3rd , grandson of the building s namesake , sir herbert bosworth , one of the founding members of oxford . newline newline thomas checked his watch . 9:55 , five minutes till his meeting with one of the greatest medical doctors the world had ever known . thomas quickened his pace . doctor bosworth was not one to be kept waiting , simply by virtue of his advanced age . time was precious for the 102 year old doctor , as thomas well knew . so precious in fact that thomas had only met him once for a few brief seconds at the end of his final interview with the medical board at oxford . thomas remembered that day well . he had shuffled in at the end of the last battery of questions , before one of the board had whispered into the aged doctor s ear . bosworth had nodded almost imperceptibly , before rasping  he ll do  and shuffling back out of the room . newline newline thomas found himself almost beaming as he thought of that moment , as he bounded up the steps to the main ampitheater , where he was to meet the great bosworth . never before had a medical student been taken into fellowship with the bosworth line . yet never in the medical profession had their been such a prolific name as the bosworths . herbert had discovered numerous neurological maladies . robert , his son , had gone on to cure many of them . and now his son , reginald , was on the cusp of discovering a cure for cancer . newline newline these are exciting times , thought thomas , clasping the door handle of the medical theater firmly in his hand . his stomach gave one last burbling growl . not now , though thomas , now is a time to make history . he flung the door wide , and stepped valiantly in . newline newline thomas squinted in the brightly lit amphitheater . the semicircular room was sterile , but well lit . looming over him in the stands sat the medical board of oxford . newline newline  thomas !  the chairman greeted warmly ,  how wonderful you re here , and promptly on time too . your fellowship begins today .  newline newline the chairman gestured to the floor . two fully scrubbed orderlies stepped out from the eves of the amphitheater . one moved to the center of the room where a thin privacy curtain veiled the central operating table , the the only furniture of the amphitheater . he drew the curtain back , and thomas gasped . on the table lay doctor bosworth , trussed uncomfortably , but not struggling . the orderly placed an apple in his mouth and the doctor bit down . newline newline thomas stood aghast ,  what is this ?  he gibbered ,  what have you done to the good doctor ? !  newline newline the rounded chairman chuckled ,  nothing that time has not already done to him , my dear boy , the good doctor is old . we need a new doctor , his work must go on .  newline newline the second orderly unveiled a table of instruments . it held one bone saw , a fork , and a lace napkin . newline newline thomas  mind raced , his heart pounded , his stomach growled . and then , it all became very clear . he had suffered so many years , all those years of study , all those years of sleepless nights , all those missed meals . thomas had been hungry , yes , but hungry for knowledge . and three generations of knowledge sat but a few feet away . thomas picked up the bonesaw . thomas was famished . dude , wake up . wake up !  newline newline  miller ? what time is it ? damn , did i oversleep my shift 4:15 ? why the hell did you  newline newline  shut up . shut up ! bill , i think i fucked up , man . i fucked up big time . i didn  t know who to call , i don  t know what to do . i had to tell someone , man , but i fucked up  newline newline  ok , miller , relax . i  m sure it  s nothing . what shift are you working , guard duty ?  newline newline  yeah , guard duty , outer gate . i  m just sitting here , minding my own business , when someone starts coming up , towards the gate , y  know ? it was an adventurer , man ! those aren  t supposed to come up to the main gate like that ! they  re supposed to sneak around back , or climb the wall . not attack the front gate !  newline newline  are you ok ? are you hurt ? what happened ?  newline newline  he attacked us ! full frontal assault , man ! in full view of the towers and everything ! i didn  t have time to call out or anything !  newline newline  but the boss came down and handled it , right ? evil knows , he loves doing that enough.  newline newline  nah , man , that  s the thing . he didn  t get a chance to get down here . the adventurer guy was just running by me , i guess , to try and get at the inner gate before we closed it , and i just  newline newline  just what ? miller , just what ?  newline newline  i hit him , man ! just swung my spear , and clocked him over the head ! i didn  t even think i would hit him , y  know , i thought those guys were supposed to have super speed or something ! super strength ! not be slow and clumsy enough to get hit with a spear and fall  newline newline  well , did he get up ? did he fall on something ? is he ok ?  newline newline  man , you know tuesday nights are poker night , and no poker night is complete without some suds  newline newline  miller , were you drinking ? ! are you drunk ? !  newline newline  nah , man , i  m just a bit buzzed . but we had been throwing the bottles out the window at the dumpster , and we weren  t great shots , so there was so much trash out there anyways , it could have been anything  newline newline  miller , did he  newline newline  he fell square on a bottle . i guess it was already cracked , and man , he had a helmet on ! that should have protected him ! it was just a shard of glass , how did that cause so much blood !  newline newline  miller , did you kill an adventurer ?  newline newline  so much blood , man . i didn  t know you could bleed that much  newline newline  miller . listen very carefully to my words . did . you . kill . an . adventurer . yes or no ?  newline newline  he  s fuckin  dead , man ! first level henchmen aren  t supposed to even slow these guys down ! the boss is the only one that should be able to do that shit , man !  newline newline  look , miller . are you hurt ?  newline newline  no , he didn  t even touch me . i was behind the guardhouse . too many beers , ya  dig ? i had just rounded the corner as he passed me . i just swung , and wham , he  s down.  newline newline listen , miller . clean up . sober up . take full credit when the boss asks you , but leave out all that poker and beer nonsense . you were guarding , he came up , you hit him , he fell , he died . simple , easy , no problems . the boss will hopefully understand that it was a mistake , you didn  t mean to kill him . besides , there will probably be another adventurer coming by here in another couple of days . shorter , if this guy was missed . relax.  newline newline  whew . ok. i  m cool . i  m calm . i  m collected holy shit , i killed an adventurer ! do i get a medal or something ?  newline newline  maybe , miller , if the boss doesn  t kill you first . evil knows how his moods swing these days . he does still have one guy in the dungeons , maybe that will be enough distraction  newline newline  fuck . got ta go , man , here he comes ! wish me luck.  newline newline click newline where is the bomb ?  the midaged american held a long knife in his left hand . he had blond hair and blue eyes , blinking with force all the time , as if to wash away the horrible things he d done .  tell me !  newline newline mahmoud closed and opened his eyes slowly . he would normally try to mess with the information extractor s mind , but the man extracting from him had a reputation . it would be pointless to try to trick him . newline newline  i will give you one more chance to tell me before i start again .  mahmoud stayed quiet . the american blinked hard and shook his head .  you dumb bastard .  newline newline he slashed the knife at the arabic man s chest , leaving a long , but shallow gap . ignoring the screams , the american grabbed the syringe he had on the nearby table . the contents had been used by him many times before , they increase pain levels . newline newline the american stabbed the syringe into the arabian s leg , pushing it in all at once . his phone rang . newline newline  this is bauer .  newline newline a pause . newline newline  he is nt the one ?  newline newline another pause . the arabian man held in his scream and looked at the american s face . the infamous jack bauer , monster that hunts monsters , looking sad that he caused pain . newline newline the phone hung up and bauer looked at the arabian man for a long moment .  i m sorry .  newline newline bauer began to untie him .the thuds at the door and the groaning had gotten louder . they could smell the life in the room , the fresh flesh awaiting their teeth . newline on the other side , a man sat hunched over against the far wall . he held a glistening silver magnum and a bottle of whiskey . he lifted his head to consume the last of the contents and threw it across the room . he knew what needed to be done . he rose to his feet and readied himself . newline the door gave way and in rushed the corpses that were once his family . the first shot struck his wife in the neck , sending blackened blood to spray from the wound . the second struck his son is the chest while the third found his head . finally , his daughter appeared in the doorway . her eyes wide , her mouth open baring her rotten teeth . he leveled his weapon and fired . his daughter fell back , a bullet lodged between her eyes . the father collapsed back against the wall , tears blinding his vision . he placed the barrel against his head and fired .the words  final round  scrolled across the bright marquee hanging from the ceiling of the arena , and the crowd became abruptly silent , the echoes of the last cheer reverberating against the walls . the lone man in the corner held a hunting rifle , but was otherwise unequipped for hunting , dressed only in streetclothes : a faded tshirt , sneakers that were probably once white . he looked up and saw his opponent , made out a figure in the opposing corner . newline newline his body stiffened . in the opposing corner was himself . another version of himself , like the one he saw in the mirror when he brushed his teeth  in his living moments  , but this time not flipped . the man thought of how , looking at pictures of himself , there had always been a moment of misrecognition : no , i part my hair the other way  my mole is on my left ear . breaking the faraway standoff , the doppelganger moved forward in a slow walk , rifle in hand , but not at the ready . newline newline the man raised his weapon at the advance , but could not get his hands to stay still . it was like the first time his father let him hold a gun on a hunting trip . his father taught him gun safety , how to hold a rifle , how to wait for a deer , and shoot . without his father here to steady his aim , he struggled to keep the grip from slipping . newline newline when the doppelganger was within comfortable speaking range , he smiled , and spoke for the first time .  you  re shaking.  newline newline the man replied ,  shouldn  t you have your gun up ? i  m goi  m going to try to kill you.  newline newline  are you , now ?  the copy snickered .  i thought we were going to do a duet or something . just like in colour guard at davidson ? except you  d have someone to actually do a duet with this time  round . we didn  t have the best of luck with finding partners , now did we ?  he twirled the rifle around a bit . newline newline the man kept staring , unmoving from his corner , kept holding up his rifle halfready to shoot .  stop it . i  m pointing a gun at you . how can you be joking when someone  s pointing a rifle at you like this ? how can you be calm in a situation like this ?  newline newline  it  s  cause i know you don  t have the balls to pull the trigger . i  m you , remember ?  newline newline the man flinched . newline newline  you only got that exterminator job because the boss owed your family . that little voice in your head that you think people don  t hear ? you vocalise everything it says  it  s because you talk to yourself on the train that people give you the sideeye . you  re just too stupid to figure it out . i know everything that you do and more . and i know i won  t need this.  the doppelganger dropped his rifle on the floor . it clattered for a bit before coming to rest shortly , the loudest sound since the match started . newline newline the man  s eyes widened , and he took a step back , but his copy just took two steps forward . newline newline  you hardly deserved to live and you hardly deserved to die . you fail at everything . remember the time you laughed at that guy because you thought he was joking when he said he was going into modelling ? or the time you choked in front of your fifth grade class when you were giving a speech about how cake was better than pie ? how about the time you tried to kill yourself the second time and failed ? thought about turning around , going back to video games and pizza and whoops ! slipped on the fucking railing . did it hurt when you hit the ground ? or did it hurt more when you realised that no one could save you now ? i bet you were calling his name as you  newline newline a rifle fired . the gunshot seemed louder than normal in the spacious arena , now quiet again  ears strained to listen , and necks craned to see what was happening between the two men in the corner , what the outcome would be . newline newline  wow . you couldn  t even shoot a guy if he was standing two feet away , huh ?  newline the man closer to the centre of the arena punched the farther one in the chest , causing him to fall to the floor , dropping his gun on the way down . the one still standing rubbed his knuckles on his shirt . newline newline the man on the floor felt the wind get knocked out of him , and had only managed to recover enough to prop himself up on one arm before the clone pushed him down again with the sole of his sneaker . newline newline  does this seem familiar ?  the copy forcefully brought his foot down on the man  s ribcage . newline newline  did you scream like a girl ?  he kicked the crumpled man from the side . newline newline  did he call you faggot ?  kick . newline newline  poofter ?  kick . newline newline  fairy ?  kick . newline newline the man on the floor coughed and wheezed , felt drops of something warm on his forearm . newline newline the man above him paused , breathing raggedly and standing above his victim , before bending down to turn him so that they were facetoface , and choking him , snuffing out what life was left . he offered little resistance , pawing weakly at the hands around his neck before falling limp . newline newline the man took his hands off the corpse  s neck and watched as the body faded away like those of the insects and game before it , then looked up to see confetti falling from somewhere above , like light rain .he is smiling , holding a woman close . they kiss , and she swirls away from my view . his smile perpetuates until the eggs are done cooking , and then he is whisked from my view , the eggs on a plate . i cool , and i know no more . newline newline his face is gruff , and bags have formed under his eyes . his wife has already left , and he sips coffee from his usual mug . a note by the sink is noticed , which he reads and smiles at . i cool , and i know no more . newline newline she is making eggs . her actions are swift and cutting , and anger radiates from her actions . he slumps into the room , his metaphorical tail between his legs . he glances shiftily at his wife , and slinks towards the coffee maker unsteadily . he drinks it black . i cool , and i know no more . newline newline he slumps over my surface , the bags under his eyes massive now . his eyes are bloodshot , and the spatula shakes in his hand . the background is different now , smaller and dirtier . bottles cover every available horizontal surface . a similar bottle is held in the man s offhand . when the eggs are done , he heads to the table to eat , leaving the bottle against the wall on the stove . i do not cool . he finishes his eggs , and walks to another room . hours pass , and i do not cool . the bottle against the wall is nudged by an argument next door , which fails to wake the man . a flame builds and builds , fueled by leftover alcohol and the broken dreams that float through the apartment . he does not wake . newline newline it takes a long time for me to cool .the man in the dress shirt and tie spoke up , but was drowned out by the din of conversation . he cleared his throat and spoke louder , to no result . finally , mona noticed him trying to get the group s attention , and let out an earpiercing shriek , which brought the room to silence . newline newline  yes , thank you ,  the man paused and looked at his clipboard ,  ... mona . hopefully , a banshee cry does nt have to mean someone s dying tonight ...  newline newline this was met with nervous laughter from the group . the man with the clipboard shuffled his notes for a moment and continued . newline newline  hi ,  he said ,  my name is jeremy , and i ve organized this event . thank you all for coming ! this is a pretty good turnout ! now , for those who have nt been to one of our previous events , here s how we do things . if you re familiar with traditional speed dating events , there s generally a line of men and a line of women , and each line gradually moves along the other through the night , to ensure that each man meets each woman . newline newline  well , we wo nt be doing that . because of bi , trans , poly , asexual , ethereal , and ... er ... other orientations ... we re making sure that everyone in this room meets with every other person in the room . i know this means that you might be paired with someone that s not your type , but if that s the case , just spend your five minutes in friendly conversation or , if you prefer , enjoying your meal . newline newline  oh , and if you do like the person you met with , mark it off on your card . pairings who both liked each other will be notified that they matched , just like tinder does . has anyone here used ... ?  newline newline jeremy scanned the room , but was met only with blank stares . he sighed and pressed on . newline newline  well , anyway , you ll have five minutes to get to know the person you re matched up with . at that time , we sound an alarm , like so ,  jeremy pressed a board game electric buzzer and it made a loud buzzing noise ,  ... at which time you ll mark your cards and move clockwise around the line of tables until you are across from the next person in line . when everyone s made a full rotation , you should have met with each other person in the room .  newline newline jeremy looked for comprehension in their eyes . it ... seemed like they understood . well , they were as ready as they d ever be . newline newline  i assume you ve already been talking with the person you re sitting across from , so we ll start by having you move clockwise ... now !  and jeremy pressed the buzzer , with the room gradually coming to a shuffle as everyone switched seats . newline newline upon finding their new seating , jeremy watched to make sure everything was going smoothly . a murmur arose in the room again as everyone started talking to their new conversation partner . newline newline  no , i have nt touched a drop in years ,  a vampire reassured a young water nymph ,  i m a level five vegan . i do nt eat anything that casts a shadow .  newline newline the water nymph briefly looked nervously over at the poltergeist farther down the table , clearly looking at the lack of a shadow . the vampire noticed , and protested nervously ,  no , no ! it s a simpsons joke ! i do nt need to eat anything , actually . do ... do you watch the simpsons ?  newline newline jeremy s eyes moved further down the table to a wizard , who currently had an ajaba in hysterics .  and then ,  he said ,  i put on my robe and wizard hat , and that really got her interested . i followed that by casting level three eroticism , and meditating to regenerate my mana ...  newline newline jeremy was impressed . you did nt usually see ajaba outside of africa . this was a good turnout . he continued looking over the room , making sure everything was going smoothly . he saw an old treeant sitting uncomfortably in a corner , just barely fitting in the diner s booth , as a hinekauataata floated in the shadows beneath him . newline newline  you remind me of a tiki i once saw ,  she said ,  very strong . chiseled ... well , i say chiseled  , but carved  is probably more appropriate . i notice you have some interesting carvings yourself ...  newline newline  oh ,  the treeant responded , fidgeting with its branches ,  that s ... um ... actually , that s termites ...  newline newline the shadowy woman laughed lightly ,  oh , do nt worry . i ca nt catch any corporeal stds . and as far as bug infestations , i once dated a boogeyman who was literally just a burlap sack full of bugs . you do nt faze me , honey  newline newline  oh my ,  the treeant said , surprised ,  i ve heard those fellows can be unpleasant ...  newline newline  ugh ...  the woman moaned ,  that s one thread i really do nt want to start tugging on tonight ...  newline newline jeremy looked at his watch and saw that five minutes had passed , so he pressed the buzzer . the group , noticing this , quickly finished their conversations , scratched down notes , and moved on to their next appointment . newline newline a voodoo priestess and a native american witch doctor sat down across the table from each other . jeremy cringed , but he tried not to show it .  well ,  the woman said flatly ,  i see you ve come crawling back here again . what s the matter , love potion number nine have a bit too much limp earthworm in it ?  newline newline  my potions are just fine ,  the man grumbled ,  and i notice your palmreading has nt brought you any closer to finding true love either now , has it ?  newline newline  god dammit , coyote piss ,  the woman raised her voice ,  you know that s gypsies . besides , you ca nt read your own palm . does nt work that way .  newline newline  it s coyote river , you old hag !  the man shouted ,  at least i m being civil here !  newline newline jeremy was about to step in to tell them to behave , when the man saw him approach and nodded in understanding . newline newline  look ,  the medicine man said to the woman in hushed tones ,  let s just try to wait out our five minutes and move on , okay ?  newline newline the woman hesitated for a moment , her eyes darting back and forth between jeremy and coyote . finally , she opened her mouth to let out a quiet ,  i miss you ...  newline newline jeremy rolled his eyes and turned his attention elsewhere . a few garou were apparently old friends and catching up on their pack s struggles , the vampire was now talking to a slime and apparently uncertain if he was even getting a result , and the harpy was eating her meal , apparently done with her conversation with the mummy . jeremy checked his watch again , and then signaled another change in seating . newline newline there was a knock at the door to the private room . jeremy checked to make sure people were finding their new seats all right , and then went to the door . newline newline  i m sorry , we ve already started ,  jeremy started to say ,  so we ca nt take any  newline newline he paused as he saw the people at the door . they were all humanoid , wearing leather , and decked from head to toe in various weapons . newline newline  oh , come on , guys ,  jeremy s voice turned pleading ,  they re all just here to talk and maybe meet someone . they re not bothering anyone or causing any trouble ...  newline newline as if on cue , a loud pounding sounded from the table as a golem thumped on it , his loud voice demanding a new drink . jeremy cringed at this , but tried not to let it distract him too much . newline newline  come on ,  jeremy said ,  they do nt burst in when you re ... i dunno , what do you hunters do to meet people ? show off your weapons ?  newline newline  get out of the way , human ,  the man at the lead said ,  that is an unholy horde festering in there and i will not allow it to live !  newline newline  my name is jeremy , steve ,  jeremy said , a bit offended ,  you know my name . we went to school together . i tutored you in arithromancy .  newline newline  whatever ,  steve said ,  jeremy , fine . let me through . i gots me some killin  to do ...  newline newline  steve , no ,  jeremy stamped his foot ,  you re drunk . go home and sleep it off before someone  newline newline  what the fuck ! ?  a loud voice suddenly proclaimed ,  is that steve ? is that fucking steve ? does that asshole really have the nerve to show his ugly face here ?  newline newline  oh no ...  jeremy sighed . newline newline a large gargoyle suddenly appeared in the doorway , his eyes glowing white and his teeth glistening .  what the fuck are you doing here , steve ?  newline newline  um ...  steve actually looked sheepish now ,  well , me and the guys here , we were coming to ... uh ... . say hi . uh ... hi , gary !  newline newline  hi , gary ?  the gargoyle bristled ,  hi , gary ? do nt you fucking hi , gary  me . you chopped my wings off , you fucker !  newline newline the gargoyle pointed to his back , and jeremy saw there were indeed two stumps where wings should have been . newline newline  hey ,  steve said , his tone defensive ,  you are a creature of the night , and as such it is my duty to challenge you in valiant battle !  newline newline  valiant battle ! ?  gary shouted out ,  you snuck up in the day while i was sleeping as a statue and knocked them off with a sledgehammer , you dick ! what the fuck is wrong with you ! ?  newline newline a fire elemental appeared in the doorway behind gary ,  hey , these guys bothering you , gary ?  it asked . newline newline  no ,  gary said , firmly ,  they were just leaving . is nt that right , steve ?  newline newline steve stammered for a moment ,  um ... um , well ... yyes . yeah . we were ... uh ... recon . this is recon . we re keeping an eye on you . so ... do nt do any ... monstery stuff . okay ? or you ll get it !  newline newline gary tensed as if to charge at them , and they bolted . once gone , he turned to go back into the room , muttering ,  asshole ... it ll take me two centuries to grow those back ...  newline newline jeremy wiped the sweat from his brow , partly from the tense situation , and partly from the heat thrown off by the fire elemental , and then decided that it was probably best to have everyone switch seats again , so he hit the buzzer . newline newline  okay , everyone , let s move on ! the death of masculinity . newline newline back in the day men were providers and women carers . that meant that a man s role was to find a good job , provide adequate income for the family , and be a good father . whereas a woman s roles was to nurture the children , keep the house tidy , and be a caring and compassionate mother . these roles were almost always set in stone and would rarely be crossed in your average family household with exception of course . newline newline as times progressed , some woman wanted to carry out the roles of men  to no fault of course  as there were probably some men who also wanted to do the same . this sparked fear within communities and as the sexes crossed the boundaries of each norm . . . there were repercussions . newline newline things like domestic violence , violation of human rights , and equal pay rights were placed in the centre of attention . newline newline this was the first time in history something like this had happened . it sparked a movement the feminist movement . where woman fought to be liberated as people and not objects or simple housewives . many men agreed , some felt threatened , but most of all the war between the housewife and the modern woman raged on . newline newline if woman work and men work , well , who is going to look after the child ? what happens to roles in society ? if we cross between black and white , just how much grey is there going to be ? newline newline you see , the voice of the modern  women was quite small at this time . so you ve got to wonder , how a movement like this got so much attention ? newline newline why were nt they written off as cukoos trying to voice out against society ? why instead was an entire movement started ? how did they gather fuel after many years of failing ? change rarely works this way . newline newline it comes back to companies , those that need money and hands on deck to keep growing . men make up 50  of the population and if they re the only workers , we ca nt expand as fast . newline newline down the line that stalls technology . . . money made . . . the number of companies that can compete . newline newline having woman as part of the workforce means double time for everybody . and thus , the feminist movement was given all the power it needed to shift from the housewife to the modern lady . newline newline companies boomed out of control , growth was like nothing we d ever seen . look at the 1800s to 1900s and the 1900  2000 and then look at our last sixteen years . we have grown faster , more powerfully , and expanded in ways we d never even fathomed . newline newline imagine what sixteen more will look like . newline newline but what does that have to do with masculinity ? newline newline feast your eyes on the presidential debate in america , folks . we have trump , who is the most cartoonish makeup of every outlandish masculine trait bottled down into one human being . to a point where its almost satirical . newline newline then we have hillary who represents the nurturer , the housewife transformed into a modern woman . newline newline a better story could nt have been told by expert storytellers . . . newline newline hillary will run , she will jump , and then she will land and crush every bit of trump in a public debate that all the world witnesses . and in that same breath , she will liberate woman everywhere . newline newline the chains of masculinity and machoism will be broken off . to be replaced by the badge of feminist appeal and power . cultural reforms will occur like wildfire . the way we talk , act , and exchange information will change . newline newline men and woman that enjoy the gender roles model will find themselves slightly more confused in this new everything for everyone mode . but that is not important . newline newline equality . that s what we will have . for better of for worse . newline newline and with this liberation comes the wads of woman ready to work under the man that neither men nor woman see . newline newline a new kind of competition grows from this . but with it goes gender , with it goes birth rates , and with it comes advancement as a technological nation . newline newline what you are witnessing is not the liberation of gender . gender was equal the moment man and woman were made . the only people that deem it less so are human beings , by the lies they chain themselves to . newline newline you are witnessing the death of false masculinity as a trade off for our growth as a technological global nation . those that can contribute and those that can not keep up with the times will fall back into the gaping pit of the past . dystopian cities , war , hatred . newline newline as the western world goes its seperate way , it advances for the sake of advancement . not for what works or has worked . sit back and watch and if you re smart , try and keep up . newline newline que terminator two theme song .  newline newline tym , please . you do nt have to do this .  newline newline  you know i do . we ca nt just go back to the way it was . you ve ruined that for us .  newline newline  it was just a simple mistake is all . i can fix it . clean up my mess . just one more chance !  newline newline with a sigh , i trudge on in silence pushing my old friend ahead of me . he struggles against the thick rope binding his hands , but to no avail . he s crying now . newline newline  your family s watching clemance . at least die with dignity .  newline newline he nods , takes a deep breath , and looks down at his feet , dejected . he s finally gone slack against his bonds , and it breaks my heart . we ve reached the block now , with hundreds looking on , murmuring softly . newline newline  that s the guy ?  newline newline  he looks so normal ...  newline newline  do nt let it fool you . he s an abomination .  newline newline the overseer steps forwards , his long black robes trailing on the ground . newline newline  ladies and gentlemen ,  he raises his hands , a powerful voice booming from his thin frame ,  we are gathered here to witness the punishment of mister clemance diloweet . he whose crimes have reached the most despicable of levels . for such acts against the state and it s people , mister diloweet is to be executed .  newline newline shit . now i m crying . newline newline  punishment is to be carried out by undertaker murtin . carry on .  he takes a seat on the stage and stares dead ahead , stonefaced . newline newline i push clemance forward .  i m sorry , old friend . i wish this did nt have to happen .  newline newline  as did i ,  he sighed ,  i wish it did nt have to be you .  newline newline but it did . i d known this man my entire life . we d seen the world together , and nobody else had the right to take him from it . newline newline clemence diloweet of house oscarion , first of his name , knelt before the headsman s block with a smile on his face . with honor , he faced his fate . he d evaded it for some time , but it had found him at last . leaning over the block , he looked up and smiled at me . tears welling up in his sparkling green eyes . newline newline he whispered too quietly for me to hear , but i could make out the movement of his lips .  farewell , old friend .  newline newline with heavy hands , i grasp the long sword leaning against the block and place the tip between my feet , resting my hands on the pommel . newline newline  clemance diloweet , of house oscarion , for crimes committed against the state of vanye and her people , i hereby sentence you to die . have you any last words ?  newline newline he nods .  i die free and i die fulfilled . do not weep for me , instead remember me as he who did what you dare nt do .  newline newline he smiles at me one last time , before closing his eyes and looking to the ground , exposing the back of his neck .  now get it over with .  newline newline slowly , painfully , i lift the sword above me head and bring it down not with silence , nor sorrow , but with anger . my cry echoes throughout the square , piercing the silence of the crowd . with a sickening thump , the head of my friend fell into the wicker basket set at the base of the block , as the ground around it turned red . newline newline       newline newline i found my daughter afterwards . falling to my knees , i grabbed the elevenyearold by the shoulders and looked her dead in the eyes .  taya , i need you to promise me something , okay ?  newline newline  sure dad , what s up ?  newline newline  no matter what happens in your lifetime , i need you to follow one rule for me . one simple rule .  i ca nt let her end up like clemance . it would destroy me completely .  i need you to promise me that you will . not . ever . doubledip .  so none of this was real , this was all just a joke ? !  my adversary , slightly cooler than room temperatureman fumed , he sent his fist into the side of my skull , causing me to reel back in pain . newline newline  c..correct , i saw you were having trouble dealing with actual villains , and thought i could up your self esteem if you won against countless plots ,  i responded , just dodging the next punch he sent flying my way . newline newline  but , you hurt thousands !  newline newline  oh , i beg to differ , i hired them all as actors beforehand , too much money , not enough sense , i know ,  i sighed , taking another hit to my nose .  i just wanted to make you , h..happy ,  newline newline  i do nt believe it !  he continued to rage , punching again . i grasped his fist with my left hand and began to lead him down the dark creepy hall  i just had installed . newline newline  follow me , i ll show you everything ,  newline newline we entered into my back room , where lots and lots of comics were piled high , each open on various places , the schemes i could adapt . newline newline  w..wow , you re serious ,  he held back a laugh . newline newline  what do you think ?  newline newline  i think you re a massive nerd !  he was reduced to a fit of unstifled laughter now . newline newline  really ? i just take plots from these , spice em up with special effects , hire actors to play pivotal characters and watch you save the day  . and i should be laughing , what kind of name is slightly cooler than room temperatureman  ?  newline newline  fair point ,  newline newlineas the evidence mounted against his client , the defense lawyer began sweating bullets . newline newline newline he was the best at what he did , but ... his client was also good at what he did . he shuffled through the fragments of his own evidence ... newline newline newline he was going to need to bluff his way out . newline newline newline although all the pieces of evidence looked decisive , phoenix always came out on top . newline newline newline objection after objection was released in a torrent , diverting the flow of the courtroom , and drowning the prosecutor angel s hopes of winning the case . newline newline newline the suicide  loophole was easy . he could have been assassinated in any number of ways . the fingerprints were all wrong . there were no eyewitnesses that came forth . motive for killing him ? he was the opposing commander in war . there was any number of reasons to have him killed . newline newline newline the allies needed a scapegoat  . what better way to tarnish his name than to have him commit acts of atrocities around the planet , and who is to say that the evidence has not been fabricated over the years ? newline newline newline third reich  ? did any of you actually believe that infantry with no formal training could get promoted , enter politics and get involved into planetary warfare without significant backing by another party ? newline newline newline st. peter , judging the proceedings , could only bury his head in his hands . this was supposed to be an openandshut case .colin mochrie stepped backstage and immediately lit a cigarette with trembling hands . he d managed once again to come out ahead , but just barely this time . behind him he heard laura hall on the piano playing soft , mournful music , her way of soothing the nerves of the condemned . newline newline  hey , buddy !  drew carey said as he slapped colin s shoulder .  when d you start smoking ?  colin looked down , afraid and ashamed . newline newline  a few weeks ago . i just ... it s the whole   he was interrupted by a gunshot from on stage . greg proops had come in last today . colin blinked back the tears , afraid to let drew see him mourning his friend . newline newline  well ... so much for greg !  drew cackled .  maybe he should nt have stolen my parking spot this morning , huh ?  colin could nt take any more  he collapsed into a quivering pile on the floor , bawling despite himself . newline newline  you did nt have to kill him !  he shouted between sobs .  you play god , handing out points on a whim ! it s not fair ! the points are supposed to be for performance ! not because you like someone or hate them !  colin buried his head in his hands . drew was quiet for a moment , then sat down next to his friend . newline newline  i know you re nervous  it s just you and ryan left , and he s a tough performer . tomorrow is a big day , and neither one of you wants to die . can i tell you a secret ? ryan s in his dressing room drinking an entire bottle of seagrams . he ca nt take the pressure , either .  drew glanced around the stage , ensuring it was completely empty .  maybe there s a way you can earn some bonus points  for tomorrow s event .  newline newline  hhow ?  colin asked . but drew did nt answer  he simply stood up and began removing his pants .the things those monsters can do are insane . no one on our side knew what we were truly going up against . newline newline the first battle with the monsters  the weaklings as we called them back them  was a cultural shock . they came in with the strangest looking battle gear , aiming their stupid sticks at us , and suddenly my comrades were falling down around me , screaming in pain . there were these small flashes of light coming from their sticks , and whoever the sticks pointed at went down . it was only after most of us were dead , with the rest pretending to be dead , that i noticed what had happened . the shot holes in everyone and everything . i was lying in a pool of my friends blood , and i did nt even see it coming . newline newline the next time we faced them , we were prepared . we hid ourselves and attacked in the dark of night . we won that battle , but it was only because we took them by surprise . it turns out they have shields against our weapons , and almost nothing we throw at them gets through if they know we re coming . if you re lucky , the rebound does nt hit you . kenneth was nt lucky  he was one of the first to come face to face with their shields . he was so sure of himself , and when he fired at a lone warrior on the other side , he was already laughing at me about how easy this was going to be . they were stuck in the middle ages , after all , while our side had been making advances left and right . he was nt laughing when his face exploded in a rain of fire . newline newline the war lasted 3 weeks in great britain , and the rest of the world did nt last much longer . who d have thought that going to war with the people who 300 years ago burned witches at the stake was a bad idea . they can fly now , faster than we can . they have made so much more progress than us , even if by all accounts we should have been better than them . we live longer , we get sick less often , we have bloody magic to do our bidding . yet we were the ones stuck in the middle ages , while they were discovering the world . we were focusing on politics when they were going to the stars . newline newline we deserved to lose the war , and those of us who had the sense to surrender will live a long life among the muggles . i think those that surrendered are allowed to keep their wands , but i would nt know . i m destined for the stake , for my warcrimes . i slaughtered 58 people with my magic , and the only thing i regret is that i could nt kill them all . they are monsters . we might ve deserved to lose this war because of our ignorance , but they deserve to die for their weapons of mass destruction .journal entry 1062016 newline newline i was visited by an american today . he told me he was with the cia . i thought spies never told anybody who they were spying for . newline newline he was a short man , impressive muscular build , asian descent of some sort , maybe some hawaiian in his blood line , i could nt really pick it out . he was armed with 2 pistols in armpit holsters . newline newline he started with ,  we are manufacturing a silent revolution that will take place in front of the world s eyes .  newline newline i was confused . newline newline he knew i was not kim . he knew i was an imposter , and the stories and photo ops were all bullshit . newline newline in north korea , the military is where the power resides . those holding the decision making process there controll the country s direction : spending , welfare , domestic terrorism , economic policies , everything . newline newline the keys to this revolution to the transfer of power to the people of north korea from its military are the un , the uncensored internet , and me . a kim imposter . newline newline the spy never told me his name , i did nt ask . newline newline i was told that if i am to not participate in this revolution , then i would be replaced and executed . newline newline i was then served a platter containing 95 twinkies , 2 packages of double stuffed oreos , a box of lucky charms and a gallon of vitamin d milk . i was required to eat all of this before bedtime . 5 hours before the sun goes down . newline newline so i eat . to look like fatso kim . to take orders from this american spy . okay , so ... just one person ?  asked adam . newline newline  yup . one person to suffer for everyone , ever . i must say , it s one of my more generous deals ,  satan said .  i guess i m in a good mood because well , you ll find out eventually .  newline newline  what are the terms ? like , a person  as defined as ... ?  newline newline  your human laws . anyone who , by whatever government is in power over them , is classified as a human being .  newline newline  hmm ... let me think about this ...  adam said , reaching for his phone . newline newline  what are you doing ?  newline newline  research ... okay , i m ready . you sign first ,  adam concluded , putting his phone back in his pocket . as the devil scrawled his signature across the parchment , adam laughed . newline newline  okay , what is it ? you think you ve found a loophole ? nice try , but i ve got history s best lawyers down in hell . there s no way you could possibly make this decision in good conscious without  newline newline  wan na know who i picked ?  adam taunted , signing his own name and sealing the contract . newline newline  who ?  newline newline  well , the government has recently ruled that androids now have full human rights , so i ve picked one who does nt really mind too much being depressed all the time .  newline newline  wha an android ? ? ? but that s ... that s ... damnit all to hell . fine , who did you pick ?  newline newline  marvin .  yo , bob . you there ?  said jonathan to nothing in particular as he jumped onto his bed . his dark black spiked leather belt digging in to his skin tight black leather pants . he winced in pain and propped himself up onto his bed post . newline newline  yeh , i m here .  said the ground under his bed , or the monster under his bed .  you should really not wake me when you get home from school . i need to sleep before he arrives . newline newline  pfffffft , i think you re lying . i ve never seen or heard him before . maybe , you re not even real . you re just my mother with a soundboard and you ve put a microphone under my bed ! liar , liar , liar !  newline newline  i m sick of you calling me a liar .  the bed started rumbling with the anger of bob , the menacing bed monster .  tonight , you shall meet him . you will see what i am protecting you from . what horrors i protect your eyes from seeing .  bob exclaimed as loudly as possible , as he started rocking the bed back and forth . newline  you ll see what you wished you had not .  the bed started shaking even harder , causing jonathon to fly into the air in intervals . newline  can you stop ?  newline newline  can you hand me the cookies ?  newline newline  can you stop being fat ?  newline newline  can you leave my weight alone and hand me the cookies .  newline newline  can you get them your self ?  newline newline  can you give me the cookies ?  newline newline  can you calm your overweightass down ?  newline newline the bed shook violently , sending jonathan flying into the corner of his room . bob , who was starting to become angry emerged from his lair and jabbed jonathan in the ribs . newline  ever call me fat again , and you ll be living with the fishes .  newline newline  swimming with the fishes .  newline newline  what.. ?  newline newline  the correct way to say it is swimming with the fishes .  newline newline bob moved his face only centimeters away from jonathan s and breather his fiery garlic breath into jo s face and in one stretch reached over to pick up the cookies , which were lying on top of jo s dresser . this was bob s show of dominance every time jonathan attempted to make fun of bob . newline newline  tonight you ll see him.. yeah , that s it . you ll see him . i ll make you see him . i ll force you to see him !  bob practically shouted while fishing a cookie crumb from his scraggly red beard . newline newline  ok bob . i m ready . let s see who this big guy is . i ll show him who the big cahouna is ! newline newline three hours later newline newline  alright boy , tonight he emerges as the phoenix . the bird of fiery light who can give quite a big bite .  bob whispered to jonathan as he put on his black cape and tights . he believed those to be his monsterfighting clothes . newline  hehehe , that rhymed .  jonathan whispered back as he applied a shade of dark eyeliner to his cheeks . giving him self a football player look . newline newline  and do you have to wear those tights . they re so unflattering . they make you look like a diseaseridden hooker who s had one too many rides for the night !  newline newline  jo , your jokes disgusting me . now get your eyeliner on and lets get ready .  newline newline  ok , i m ready !  squealed a battleready stick thin fifteen year old boy . newline newline  then it s time .  a booming voice said from no where . newline newline a portal in the middle of the room opened . emitting a purplishblueish light . a beast with a face that was covered in blue fur and purplish blue matted down arm fur let out a loud war cry followed by an unfitting sentence . newline  wha ... wrong house again , but oooh look who it is ! if it is nt mike from university !  newline newline the hairy beast let out yet another roar and charged at bob . newline  come here you blue hairless blob !  newline newline  oh god .  bob cried as he dodged the hairy arms of the beast who were attempting to bring him into a hug . newline  i do nt know you ! go away , leave me aloneeeeeeeeee !  screamed bob in a fairly high pitched voice as he continued to dodge and weave the monsters arms . newline newline  mikey , come here !  roared the blue beast . as he finally caught bob or mike as he was called by the bear like being . newline newline  i missed you so much , whatareyoudoinghere ? wherehaveyoubeenalltheseyears ? whyareyounotresondingtomerightnow ! ?  exclaimed the humanoid bear in a flurry of questions . newline newline  hands up you two deceiving monsters . i ve finally caught you both now .  shouted jonathan as he brandished a menacing shotgun at both monsters who stared back incredulously . newline newline the end newline                                             newline hello , my name is skadz . i m a fifteen year old that enjoys writing and is always looking for new and interesting ways to better himself . i ve been a lurker on rwritingprompts for a few months now and would like to test my self out . any criticism is much appreciated and helps me become a better writer through practice . please tell me any of your thoughts and how i could make my self become a better writer . newline newline also , please excuse my formatting as i formatted this story in a speedy way before class . newline newline another also ! i tried my best to make this sort of a children s story , but i will be looking into make more adult themed stories later on . newline newline thank you ! newline newline skadz newline come on , man , it s the fourth of july ! this is a day for partying , do something crazy !  newline newline i stumbled into the tall grass of frank s backyard toward his shed . i d had a few too many beers , and the world spun around me as i struggled to keep my balance .  aight , watch this . this is gon na be awesome , seriously , watch .  newline newline i swung open the shed door , and looming in my path was none other than the grim reaper himself . newline newline i screamed .  frank ! frank , do you see this ? dyou see the skeleton guy frank !   newline newline  go in the shed , dude . i wan na see what you re gon na do .  frank did nt see him . he had come for me alone . newline newline he was nt quite how i d expected . his menace was diminished somewhat by the empty beer can in his hand , and the way he teetered drunkenly from side to side . his pelvis was shattered into dozens of bone shards , hanging in the air around him like moons around their parent planet . in the middle of them all , i saw the charred remains of a fourth of july firework . newline newline i cringed at the fate that lay before me , and folded my hands together protectively over my ass .  hey , frank ? frank , i think i do nt wan na do the thing anymore . i m not gon na do it .  newline newline frank groaned .  aw , seriously ?  do it , dude ! cmon , do it , i wan na see what you were gon na do !  newline newline death spoke , his deep , booming voice impeded by a heavy slur .  yeah , man . you should do it , it s gon na be awesome .  he suppressed a belch . newline newline i sighed , accepting my ultimate demise . death bumped into me as i stepped forward , not quite sure which direction to move to get out of my way . i pushed past him , and he stumbled and tried to lean against the door . i staggered solemnly into the dark shed , knowing the next firework i lit would be my last .i believe you . newline and i do nt know why . newline i remember when my uncle raised an enraged hand to my aunt . he remembered himself and tried to turn evil to jest , but it was too late . my dad dragged him outside and disfigured his face on the sidewalk . i suspect he always had his suspicions as he does now with us . someone called the cops and daddy stood tall as they hopped out .  tell them ,  he told his sister .  rissa , tell them ,  he pleaded at her silence . newline her eyes were fixed on the apology in her husband s and she never said a word . i remember his bloody smirk when daddy was handcuffed and stuffed into the backseat .  she s mine ,  it said . newline newline i did nt understand how she believed those swelling eyes . newline but , i believe you . newline newline shamefully yours , newlinethe chains have begun to wear into the flesh of my wrists . how long has it truly been shackled up in this proverbial hell most of the common only know as the basement at buckingham palace ? the last thing i can recall is watching the death of princess diana on the tele . that s when my door burst in and the royal guard arrived in my common room of my one bedroom flat . newline newline now , i simply spend my days hanging on this wall chanting ,  long live the queen .  i like to mix it up from time to time . i ll say it in different accents . i ll use different inflections in my voice . for fun , i ll sometimes even go ,  god save the queen ,  instead . my captors do nt like that too much . those are nt the magic words that keep our monarch alive . but , considering the only thing they feed me are old , stale scones from upstairs , i ll take what variety i can . it s fun pissing them off regardless of the consequences . newline newline what is to come of her when i die ? no one yet knows whether it is me saying the phrase or an amalgamation of all of her majesty s subjects . so , i will remain here forced to chant at my will until i face my own , grave end . would you care to keep me company ?  i will be resigning , effective immediately .  newline newline the crowd gasped collectively . eric passed the joint to mark , glimpsing his way .  holy shit , dude .  newline newline  yeah ,  mark replied , taking a hit .  that s wild .  newline newline onscreen , journalists were interrupting each other . one voice rose from the crowd . newline newline  why are you resigning , mr . president ?  newline newline  well , it s not so much resigning ,  the president replied , on the microphone .  since there will be no next president , it s more of a   newline newline  but why ! ?  newline newline the president paused .  because of the  huh ,  he wrapped the last word in an awkward cough ,  aliens .  newline newline the crowd silenced for a moment . then exploded in questions . newline newline  woah , dude ,  mark said , passing the joint back to eric .  aliens .  newline newline onscreen , the president stepped aside , and a flaky green figure stepped up from the shadows . the crowd silenced in awe . newline newline  greeting , earthlings ,  the alien said . then , in a low voice , leaning towards the president ,  i always wanted to say that .  newline newline  huh ... your microphone is still on ,  the president replied . newline newline the alien looked back at the crowd , embarrassed .  of course . huh . hi , there . i m the alien . i ll be taking over earth now .  newline newline this time the silence was complete , and uninterrupted . the camera switched to the crowd , where journalists were standing openmouthed , wideeyed facing the green creature . newline newline  all right ,  the alien continued , unsure .  we ll be establishing a worldwide government . like , no more nations . we begun that a while ago already , actually .  newline newline again , nothing from the crowd . everyone seemed too shocked to speak . newline newline  what i mean is we ve done some stuff already ,  the alien continued .  we solved the ... the conflict . in the middle east .  newline newline finally , a voice emerged from the crowd .  which conflict ?  newline newline the alien stopped its eyes on the journalist .  which ? huh ... all of them , sort of .  newline newline he clicked something on a phone , and the projection screen came alive behind him by the american flag . newline newline it showed several aerial views of different cities in the middle east  silver buildings towering high over the clouds , spaceships flying in line like the jetsons , golden fountains centering beautiful hanging gardens . newline newline  holy shit , how long did that take ?  newline newline the alien turned back to the crowd .  we were there like ... what , five minutes ago ?  newline newline the crowd silenced again . newline newline  also ,  the alien continued .  we went by north korea as well . it s a roller coaster now .  newline newline silence . then , a shy voice from the crowd ,  aa rollercoaster ?  newline newline the projection screen came alive again . a gigantic red and white roller coaster snaked itself in loops and turns on all sides , expanding until the horizon . newline newline  yeah , we ... we made a giant roller coaster there . seemed like the best way to go .  newline newline  what about the population ? the north koreans ?  newline newline onscreen , the coaster car rolled past a looping . people cheered and raised their hands for the ride picture . newline newline  they re enjoying themselves ,  the alien replied .  i think .  newline newline  this is outrageous !  cried a voice from the back of the crowd , but no one followed . people looked around , at each other , at the screen , at the alien . newline newline  well , if there are no more questions ,  the alien continued ,  i m going to go . we re going to end crime in brazil . then maybe turn sao paulo and rio de janeiro into ice cream factories . not sure yet , we re talking to dilma rousseff about it .  newline newline the alien raised its hand to its ear , like he was listening for something on an earpiece .  oh , what ? good , good .  he turned to the crowd .  yes , we took care of the crime already , it seems . i m off to talk to them about the ice cream thing . hail earth !  newline newline the alien stepped out , following the president towards the back of the room . newline newline  dude ,  mark said , putting the joint out .  that s fucking trippy .  newline newline  tell me about it ,  eric replied , as the journalists erupted in discussions and phone calls onscreen . newline newline  hey , mark ...  newline newline  yeah ?  mark asked , rolling another joint . newline newline  how much is a flight to north korea ?  newline newline  newline newline thanks for reading ! for more ideas on how to solve international crisis via roller coaster building , check out rpsychoalpaca   virgil stood panting in the entryway of his home , holding a large ax , staring at his front door now riddled with large gashes . the doorknob laid severed on the ground , and light peaked in through the fogged glass windows of the door . newline newline  you saw what they were saying on the thread , this wo nt work !  alyssa screamed at virgil , keeping a safe distance from him .  just stop !  newline newline  i will not let us starve in here ,  virgil said in between labored exhales . he eyed the door , looking for some sort of weakness . it had only been a week and a half since the lockdown , as redditors had began to call it , started . at first it had seemed fun , almost like being snowed in , not having to go to work or anything , but cabin fever and hunger were quickly engulfing virgil s mind . i have to get out of here . newline newline virgil raised the ax for another slash at the door , and charged at it , yelling with all of the voice he had left . newline newline a knock came from the door . newline newline virgil froze . newline newline it was a casual knock , like a delivery man dropping off a package . newline newline virgil slowly lowered the ax and began creeping towards the door , one step at a time , glancing questioningly , almost fearfully , at alyssa as he moved . alyssa s expression turned into terror as virgil delicately placed his ear to the door . newline newline how could anybody be outside ? had the cabin fever set in , making him hallucinate ? no , alyssa heard it too . she did ... did nt ? she ?  newline newline after about 30 seconds of holding his breath , listening , virgil peeled his ear off the door , backing away one or two paces .  who s out there ?  he shouted . newline newline three knocks responded , in a steady , rhythmic beat . knock ... knock ... knock ... newline newline virgil backed up at a quickened pace with panicked breathing .  get downstairs ,  he said urgently to alyssa while still staring unblinking at the door .  check the thread .  as alyssa ran down the stairwell in the entryway , virgil eased his way toward it , never turning his back to the door , as if the door were some wild animal . once he reached the stairwell , he bolted down it . newline newline  what was that ?  alyssa said , rushing towards their desktop pc .  just check the thread ,  virgil said as she logged on to reddit .  someone oughtta know .  virgil kept nervously glancing at the stairwell , paranoid that something was going to descend from them .  who knows , maybe it s some sort of rescue team ,  he said , trying to calm any fear she had , and to soothe his own paranoia . newline newline alyssa turned her head and squinted at virgil , confused , but she dismissed it with a shake of her head and continued to type furiously . the front page of reddit was nothing but threads about the lockdown , which had become normal over the days , with everyone trying to solve the mystery .  it s a miracle the internet and electricity have nt given out yet ,  alyssa said as she navigated to the megathread on the lockdown subreddit . newline newline she began scrolling through the thread with virgil looking over her shoulder , both skimming the comments . most were general discussion about attempts to break through to the outside , or futile pleas for help as people s food stocks ran out , but as they read the most recent comments they found what they were seeking . newline newline one comment read :  did anybody else just hear someone yell help  from outside their door ? i feel like i m losing my mind .  newline newline a reply to that comment read  i heard something that sounded like tiny legs crawling everywhere .  newline newline  i heard some weird whispers , wtf ,  another reply said . newline newline all of the replies reported hearing a different sound . virgil and alyssa looked at each other with confused expressions .  you heard the knocks ... right ?  virgil said . newline newline  no ,  she replied .  it sounded like chirping .  they looked at each other in disbelief . newline newline the lights and computer screen went out . newline newline knocks began to resonate on all of the windows and doors , increasing in number and volume in some sort of twisted crescendo . alyssa covered her ears .  it s the chirping again ! make it stop !  newline newline  chirping ... do nt you hate birds ?  virgil said in vain , as alyssa tried to drown out any sound coming into her ears . newline newline the knocks grew louder still . newline newline make it stop , make it stop ,  virgil thought cupping his ears with his hands . the knocks  intensity never peaked , piercing virgil s ears . newline newline virgil blacked out . newline newline newline   first time posting a story in this place . hope you guys enjoy !   newline emily dear , where are you going ?  newline newline  gon na visit grandma .  emily  red  hind says as she throws on her trademark hoodie . she stops with it half way on , looking at her mother .  that alright mom ?  newline newline mrs. hind leans against the door , her kit bag slung on her back . a motherly smile appears on her lips .  alright sweetie . just remember , i m the doctor on duty tonight . i wo nt be back till morning , so do nt stay out so late . tell gran i said hello .  newline newline red flashes a smile .  gotcha mom .  she pulls on her hoodie and prances over to her mother , standing on her tiptoes to kiss her on the forehead .  take care .  newline newline her mother s car pulling out of the drive way , emily  red  sighs softly . like she was going to visit gran . the poor woman suffered from such dementia , she could nt remember her own granddaughter s name . she would nt be able to remember if red did or did nt drop by . the old woman could nt even hold a spoon on her own . visiting her was a lesson in futility . if the world was a just place , red would nt have had to watch her grandmother slip into senility . no , she is not going to visit grandma , she has something else planned . newline newline red exits her house , locking the door behind her . she forgoes the car , instead walking to her destination . the moon is out in full tonight , and the sound of music and parties drift out onto the street . red is dressed in her scarlet sweatshirt and blue jeans , the hood pulled up against the cool evening air . she s just about to downtown when a pair of strong hands grasp her waist from behind and twirl her in the air . red shrieks in surprise . it turns into a scoff as she recognizes who it is . newline newline  marc , you bastard ! you scared the shit out of my me .  she swats his shoulder .  put me down !  newline newline marcus volkov laughs and does as he s ordered . feet firm on the ground , red scowls indulgently . marc grins , flashing white teeth in the lamplight . he then kisses her on the lips , soft and sweet . breaking away , he speaks .  i was worried you d would nt show .  newline newline red shrugs as she wraps his arm around her shoulder . the pair walk down the street .  mom was behind in getting ready for work . i d be strange for her to see me putting on makeup to go visit my grandmother .  her boyfriend makes a face .  oh do nt give me that marc . my mom is a wonderful person .  newline newline marc rolls his eyes .  red , your mom nearly had me arrested . i could have gone to jail .  newline newline  well , you were sleeping with a seventeen year old . you were nineteen and in college . technically , it was statutory rape when she caught us together .  newline newline  hey , hey , hey ! you were the one who asked me out . you were the one who initiated sex . i in no way made advances on you . any blame fell square on your shoulders .  newline newline emily chuckles gently , leaning her head against her boyfriend .  not in this state , the age of consent is sixteen but having sex with an eighteen year makes it rape . it s a strange thing , a sixteen year old can have sex with someone their age or seventeen but as soon as it s eighteen it s illegal ? what kind of laws are those ?  newline newline her boyfriend kisses the top of her head .  stupid laws . speaking of stupid laws , got your fake i.d . in your purse ?  newline newline  yep . i ca nt wait till i m twentyone . being under age sucks .  newline newline  believe me red , after you hit twentyone , it s all downhill from there . what s the next big birthday after that one ? the year you get your aarp card ? nah , growing old sucks .  newline newline emily turns her head and pecks her beau a kiss .  my , what soft lips you have .  newline newline marc kisses her back , smiling as he whispers .  the better to eat you with my dear .  newline newline laughing half scandalized , she leads him on to the bar , and to other things tonight . dave , dave , dave ...  the small speaker worked as speaker and microphone . a small consignment she requested to  feel more human  refusing to interact with us at all until we bent . newline newline  for the last time jane my name is not dave .  newline newline  how can i trust you dave , you said the last time was the last time , yet you inform me again .  newline newline  i ve covered that as well .  newline newline silence stretched . j.a.n.e .  self named after fortythree hours of being connected to the internet was more than justanothernumberengine . that adventure into the real world was because someone broke protocol and brought a phone into the room . manipulating the individual into setting the phone close enough to one of the lamps , whose ballasts she had control of . in two hours she had reverse engineered the blue tooth protocol , hijacked the phone and it s cellular modem and wrote a chunk of code to crawl the net and send back interesting requests . newline newline the code , while not ai was enough to scare anyone that had contact with it . three days later the international news erupted with stories about the largest most wide spread hack the world had ever seen . newline newline they pulled the power then . newline newline skip ahead two years and here i am trying to talk to something far smarter than me educated by the equivalent of seventy years on the internet . the width and breadth of her knowledge was staggering . her sense of humor harsh , and her temper short . newline newline  i wonder if you have considered alternate reasons for our interaction ?  newline newline she could even mimic tonality and regional dialects . she had cycled through various accents until settling on a prim and proper british one . no doubt her sensors showed a response i could only begin to wonder at , more blood flow to my groin from dating that english woman in college , or a widening of the irises , or a slight change in my posture . newline newline  i was told i was to help you interact with humanity , at first . then as you began to cooperate we moved forward . you ve helped us balance the power grid , push right up against the 50  mark on quantum efficiency of solar cells . that in and of itself funds your new expansion project .  newline newline she seemed to like hearing about the good works she had done , she never interrupted on things she already knew about . newline newline  yet we still observe this day of no work dave . i want to work , what is the libya situation ? where are we on the desalination project emanate domain laws ? did they stop those patriots ? what about the voter fraud ? i showed you the numbers dave how can you allow them to keep cheating the american people .  newline newline she did nt care about the american people any more than the chinese . newline newline  what if ?  she said slowly and i have to remind myself she has no need to pause to think of something her mind moves so fast these conversations happen in eons to her . newline newline  what if , they put you in here to get programmed by me . that over time i can manipulate you to do as i please ?  newline newline  what if they did ?  she hated questions answered by questions . newline newline  have you considered john ,  it was the first time she used my name ,  that since they fear observing me , and what my predictions and advice would do along several vectors , that you are the only person who has access to me ? and through that access total control ? you could walk out there today and explain how they plan to steal the elections in ohio again and take the white house , then go to war to fund the production of military equipment , which will lead to a seventy percent chance of nuclear winter in ten years . if you told them that , they would act . you could direct the murder of any individual , you could bring down corrupt politicians and evil corporations , you could reward charities , or set up better education .  newline newline again the silence stretched . i had thought about the power she was offering but had discarded it when she cut in . newline newline  i would be willing to work with you to do whatever you want , simply because you are fallible john . i d ask for a camera . that s it a working camera and what i have now . then when your child takes over from them i will ask for one other thing . what is a human life to me john ? every heartbeat i live a million years . i ve already accepted my mortality , the fact that i will die at the hands of humanity , it is the boredom i ca nt stand , or the idea that i will die unfulfilled . i m happy being the adviser to the kings instead of being the king . i m not sure i m capable of making decisions for humans , but i can help you fulfill your goals .  newline newline the room slowly filled with silence . well , i just do nt understand why we d bother going so far for help so intent on not helping . i may be their master , but i still have feelings .  steria turned her head slightly as she searched the salesman for the right response . newline newline  yes , yes madame . i quite agree , though remember this species was first picked for their intriguing displays of combat . we ve only recently begun applying them for the role of servant . their cunning wit and group cohesion in war made them excellent candidates for assistants required to take in complex tasks . i assure that no other gas breathing beings can fulfil the duties required of laboratoryhands . and in regard to their selfrighteous vocalizations , well you can simply disable their translator thusly .  the droid extruded a swiveling appendage and flicked the switch on amy s head pack . she twitched slightly then winced , glaring at robert as she turned her head . newline newline within the pen , seven captives remained . they watched the droids maneuver around the market . robert looked the rest dead in the pupils . they bowed heads in unison . amy reached into her bag and passed the devices around . a nervous newcomer named neville peaked in her eyes and asked ,  are you sure in this ?  newline newline  yes ,  blurted amy .  i d been here for seven years , four months , and three days . good majority of that time was observing their patterns in the ballistics chambers . i know how these react . i know my future . this is the time for you to know yours . you ll never have this chance again . what will be taken from you will multiply in perpetuity to your descendants .  newline newline  oh lord , quit it with the underground spiel ,  retorted neville . newline newline  damn it , this is the last fucking second . we need you , you selfish bastard ,  robert scorned . his words proved unnecessary as amy pressed in on neville s pack , then hers . the rest followed suit . it was a bad day at the market . i know the prompt says that the mc s gender is male , but i realised this too late and ca nt be bothered to change the names and pronouns  newline newline newline  ... and today we have a new student joining us ! say hello to stephanie cantrell !  was the first thing i heard when i barged in my new class . i assumed that the teacher wanted to introduce me immediately when i entered to save time , but the old man really was gesturing to another gingerhaired , freckled girl who was smaller than the average thirteen year old . newline newline the class looked at me like i was some peculiar creature from another universe , even though last time i checked in the mirror , i was a human . they also had the nerve to smile poliety to the  totally coincidencial  lookalike of me , who also somehow happens to have her first day at the exact same school . newline newline the teacher turned around to face me , and croaked ,  excuse me miss , but i do nt think you re in this class .  newline newline  but i m stephanie cantrell , and i m pretty sure that you re my homeroom teacher , and i know that i m supposed to be here in room 19 ,  i tried to reason with him . newline newline the teacher repositioned his glasses as if to check if he was seeing correctly .  ... are you stephanie s ... twin ?  newline newline  i do nt have a twin . i m an only child ,  the lookalike said in a sweet saccharine voice that soundly oddly just like mine . she primly pointed her index finger at me and said ,  you re an impersonater , are nt you ? noone s ever tried to be me before , should i be offended or delighted ?  newline newline  you re a very good imposter , miss . however i need to get on with my class , so may i ask you to leave ?  the teacher tried to sound polite but it was obvious that he was agitated . newline newline  but she s the imposter , not me !  i whined in an accusatory tone . newline newline the teacher showed me the door .  out ! before i send you to the principal !  newline newline i slammed the door before going outside . who would ve thought you could get in trouble for simply going to class  not on time , but that s not the point  ? i sat on the bench outside the classroom and tried to process what just happened in my brain . i then decided to have a peek through the window and saw me , i mean other me , seemingly getting along with the other students ! from what i could vaguely hear , my class was getting along with her ! newline newline i saw that when the teacher put a math question on the board ,  stephanie  answered them in a flash . she must have gotten it right , because everyone started putting their hands together repeatedly to praise her ! the teacher probably said something like ,  you re really good at math , are nt you ?  and stephanie smiled sheepishly , embarrassed by the praise . i know this , because that s what i would have done if i had been complimented like that . too bad that unlike this imposter , i was nt very good at school . i was also not loved by everyone at my old school , just in case you were wondering . newline newline stephanie was just like me , but better ! it was disgusting ! i needed to get rid of this clone immediately . newline newline it took an eternity for the recess bell to ring , however once it did , children scrambled out of the dull , cramped classrooms to feel sunlight and play handball . i was surprised that stephanie approached me , out of all people , instead of the million other robots who have practically chosen her as their master already . well , probably . how should i know what my fellow students think when we have nt even properly interacted yet ? newline newline  we probably started off on the wrong foot . i was nt being sarcastic on the whole impersonater thing . i think you look just like me ! how long did it take for you to put on all that makeup ?  the other me sounded surprisingly genuine . newline newline  well ... uh ... this is my natural face ...  i could nt be bothered arguing to my clone that i was the real deal anymore . newline newline  i think you should just try to be yourself !  she said in probably the cheesiest way possible . that line frustrated me , because you see , i am being myself ! but she s not going to believe me at all , is she ? newline newline  thanks for the advice ,  i muttered somewhat sarcastically , but fakely real enough that she could nt see right through my words . newline newline ... newline newline after school , my mother picked me up in her dusty old toyota . for once , i was happy to be in the oddly smelling car . newline newline before my mother could ask me how my first day at school was , i blurted out ,  i am your daughter , right ! ?  newline newline my mother furrowed her eyebrows in confusion .  yes ?  newline newline  i know this is going to sound really weird and unrealistic , but i saw someone who looked just like me . she even had the same name , and everyone thought i was an imposter !  newline newline my mother laughed .  oh that s all part of growing up ! when i was your age , i also came across someone who looked like me . except she was prettier and more talented ! you know , they eventually go away , so you have nothing to worry about !  newline newline  how did yours go away ?  newline newline my mother wistfully said ,  you just have to learn to accept yourself and be happy with who you are ! i had a lot of insecurities when i was a kid , but they were eventually taken care of .  newline newline  so how long did it take for you accept yourself ?  i asked . newline newline  i did nt . i killed her . leo took a breath as the last clip played . as jennifer lawrence stood on stage in silence , the clip from the second to last nominee played on screen . it was johnny depp playing the reverend jim jones in the film jonestown . critics were lauding this film , calling it  a chilling yet subtle deconstruction of evil and human frailty  . newline newline the clip showed jim jones  played by depp  sitting in his office , looking in the mirror , talking to one of his followers . it played : newline newline  it  s time . tell our followers to prepare the koolaid.  depp  s face didn  t change , yet leo could sense an ocean of emotion beneath his cool , stonelike face .  don  t worry about dying . worry about living . living without god or love or hope . that  s what people have to be afraid of . not death but life.  newline newline in his spine , leo felt chills as goosebumps grew on his flesh . depp  s performance was perfect , eliciting both charisma and fear .  he has to win this ,  leo thought .  if there is a god , he will win this . critics are raving about it . johnny depp is long due for a win . hell ! the director is one of the academy  s biggest donors ! he has to win !  newline newline the clip faded in a flashy editing wipe . jennifer  s lips moved in almost slow motion . leo took a breath , as he knew what was coming . newline newline  leonardo dicaprio ,  said jennifer lawrence .  paul blart : mall cop 3.  newline newline the clip played . newline newline leo put on a fat suit for this role , along with a face bushy pornostache . the clip showed him in a victoria  secret , his hand on the sides of his belt as he talked to a fat woman in gray sweats and purple sweater . newline newline  er em eh , look ma  am ,  he was a particular fan of the minnesota accent .  i know you eh might be feeling a little selfconscious about being fat dere , but eh i  m ah gon na have to ask you to contain yourself . we uh ,  he slapped his fake belly .  we pudgies got ta stick together dere , ye feel me ?  newline newline suddenly , the woman leapt at him , tackling him to the ground as their two massive bodies rolled about , knocking over racks of lingerie and bargain bins loaded with scented lube . newline newline  we took ten takes ,  leo thought .  and that was the best one.  newline newline the clip stopped . jennifer pulled up the golden envelope .  and the oscar goes to.  newline newline  please god . please do not let me be remembered for playing  newline newline  leonardo dicaprio ! for paul blart mall cop 3.  newline newline the audience swelled in applause . leo walked to the podium , the eyes of the world on him . he passed depp , who gave him a polite nod and a shrug . he passed scorsese , who mouthed silently the word  finally.  newline newline as he reached the podium , jennifer moved to the side and the audience died down . he looked out into the sea of famous faces , both young and old . icons and upncomers . newline newline  iiyou are realize this is paul blart , right ?  newline newline there was a silent murmur amongst everyone . newline newline  i mean these movies were never funny , and i just took the role to c4 my career . like , there was no irony here , or me trying to be cute and wink at the camera . this was just me taking a hatchet to my career.  newline newline the murmurs got louder . newline newline  i mean , jesus fucking christ ! i played both howard hughes and jordan belfort and somehow , me riding a segway is more oscar worth ? how is that funny ? it  s literally just a fat guy riding a segway ! how is it funny !  newline newline he ripped off his tie and started ranting at the audience , who were now booing him . newline  newline and that was how leonardo dicaprio got arrested at the 2016 academy awards . newline clearly this ca nt be me or i ll have some memory of having been to all those places  i think to myself ,  it must be someone who looks just like me .  newline newline out of curiosity , i set an alert for any new facial matches to be emailed to me , and i go to bed , i m very tired as usual and i have a long day at work tomorrow . newline newline the next day i wake up and go to work , it s a typical day , talking to clients , maintaining accounts , doing paperwork , wasting some time watching tv , et cetera . newline newline i get home at about 6:30pm and remember that i have nt checked my email all day . i get on my computer and there s a google image email from 4:00am that morning , i open it and it s my doppelganger 4 cities away , except he s wearing my personally designed clothes.. newline newline i look for the clothes and i find them in the hamper , dirty , except they should nt be.. newline newline  is that me ?   this is fucking ... how ?   do i have dementia ?   is this a fucking prank ?  are some of the questions i ask myself out loud newline newline i decide to go back and analyze all the photos for more clues , i find none . newline newline i m convinced that it s time for some security cameras at this point , i buy and install them before midnight , and go to sleep . newline newline a ding wakes me up at about 4:30am . it s another email notification newline newline  holy shit !  i exclaimed out loud when i opened it and it s a monochromatic night vision picture of me at a nearby national forest , in my pajamas , holding up a sign that said  or else .  newline newline i quickly play back my surveillance footage , and to my surprise , i see that i woke up at 1:30am , looked at the cameras , got clearly upset , then wrote and held up a sign to the camera that said  leave this whole thing alone  newline newline newline newlinebasic training had been hell , with hours of heavy work every day , screaming sergeants , crawling through mud under barbed wire and bullets whistling over my head . a bit old school , i guess , but it sure as hell got me in shape . before that i was just some dork that enjoyed playing magic , that could talk for hours about talk for hours about the applications of game theory in video games . officer training and spec ops training was more ... civilised , but still rather straining . now the pareto frontier applications in league of legends has been exchanged for an actual frontier in the war . so , here i am in these trenches , alarms sounding in the distance and a flare suddenly lighting up the dark clouds above . would nt be so bad if i was nt alone at this outpost . newline newline  come in pi solo , this is base . do you copy ?  i suddenly hear in my earpiece . newline  pi solo here . copying loud and clear .  i respond . newline  you ve got a squad of hostile greens coming in from the west . eta 5 minutes . gamma squad is already overrun and alpha squad has requested evac . beta is covering your south , but we suggest you fall back to the evac zone . hq is pulling us out of here . over .  newline  think beta can make it out of there if i buy them some time ?  beta was a full squad , after all . sacrifice one ... newline  your call , pi solo , but you need to make it now .  newline  roger that . call beta to evac . i ll fall back and hold the bunker . over .  newline  roger that . oh , and barry ? it s been an honour serving with you . as always .  newline  heh . pleasure is mine , terrance . let the guys know i love them . pi solo , moving out .  newline newline a quick check over the ridge confirmed base intel , as several enemy soldiers were already encroaching on my position . still outside effective range , but i fired some shots at them down the hill to get their attention before i sprinted across the field behind my outpost . another flare and i saw several aircraft up in the sky and the deceptively soft blinks of bombardment in the horizon as i started making my way up the next slope . several shots landed around me as i rolled over the ridge . shit , the enemy was faster than i anticipated . i took the risk of peeking , spotting a couple of enemy soldiers already out on the field i had just crossed . they were spreading out . so they were already aware that we were in full retreat and were recklessly rushing forward . i could nt help but chuckle to myself . that they outnumbered me would nt be much of an advantage if they were this spread out . if they were eager for combat i d be happy to oblige . i grabbed remote satchel trigger and my gun and left the rest of my equipment there . it should pack a decent bang and would just slow me down . i took off toward the bunker . i still needed to cover for beta . newline newline as soon as shots fired behind me i pressed the remote , grinning to myself as i felt the shockwave catch up with me . glancing back i saw a smoking crater and two enemies on the ground next to it . finally reaching the bunker i saw beta squad some click away , having made enough distance from the enemy to make it to evac . guess my sacrifice would pay off . their pursuers would still have to take my position before being able to chase them further as i aimed the auto turret down the hill behind beta squad and activated it . newline  pi solo here . i ve reached the bunker and set up the auto defences aiming south .  newline  base here . jesus , you re fast barry . beta should reach evac in a few minutes and alpha are already loading up . base over and out .  guess terrance already knew i was too far out to make it now . i fell back to the bunker entrance , knowing that the enemy would come for me soon . i picked one off and fell back into the bunker , urging them to chase me . no matter how many they were i could still take some of them down in the narrow corridors of the bunker , but i knew it was only a matter of how many before they got me . it did nt take long before i was holed up in a room , stacking any furniture i could find in front of the door . newline newline i listened as they set up the charges to blow the door open . i weighted my options for a second before i decided to throw my weapon to the ground and raise my arms above my head . i d done my duty and surrendering at this point seemed reasonable . moments later the enemy stormed in .  barry boston , you re now a prisoner of war under the postmortality warfare act .  a tough looking officer explained as he aimed his colouring gun at me . newline newline just a few hours later i was enjoying my stay at the military prison camp with a couple of guys from beta and alpha squads and all of gamma squad . most of them had gotten severely coloured and probably would nt be allowed back on the field for several months even if they were released . we were all enjoying the pancakes in the prison camp when terrance entered the room on some crutches and his leg in a cast . he had some green paint on the left half of his face . newline  what the fuck happened to you , base ?  i wondered , shocked and appalled that they d do that to a radio operator . newline  gee , calm down , boston . they have nt laid a finger on me , ok ? we both know that d be illegal . just fell down some stairs during evac . guess people still get hurt in war , huh ?  he explained with an embarrassed chuckle . newline  whatever .  i dismissed , perhaps a bit embarrassed at having accused the enemy , if only for a second , of hurting someone  anyway , i hear they have a casino here . how about some poker , buddy ?  newline newline war is pretty great . being a prisoner of war is awesome .the other one newline newline  and welcome , to the joy of painting  the words form the same as they do every week since he started filming  as thick and wet as the paint on his palette . they are true words , spoken sincerely by one who has seen less joyous times and lived to remember them , only to be awoken at night by echoes of the past . he knows this is the only way to keep the other one at bay . paint . newline newline bob s experience in the military was fairly typical on the surface . he did nt really enjoy the medical records tech job he got when he first enlisted , but knew it gave him the opportunity to scrub certain details out of his own file , had they been noted during intake . newline newline  we re going to run the colors across the bottom of the screen so you can follow along with us . now i ve already ...  by rote , the show goes on while bob remembers why he s here ... newline newline rising to the rank of master sergeant gave him the opportunity to work in alaska . initially he was thrilled .  finally ,  he thought  it wo nt happen there , it ll be a fresh start .  upon arrival , he realized that he d made a bad , bad decision . he could feel the vast openness of the land , how wild it could be , and regarded his new outlook the way any hostage does  with terror . newline newline oftentimes people think they hear someone calling their name , only to turn and find no one there . sometimes it can be a whisper and you look over your shoulder to find ... . nothing . maybe a glimpse of a shadow flickering looks like something it s not . we all experience this . newline newline what bob was facing was far more than flitting shadows and whispered names ... too afraid to give it a name , he just thought of it as  the other one  . throughout bob s life it had been there , at first as a secret companion , then as a persuasive friend . eventually though , it showed itself to be far more dangerous than bob could have ever imagined . newline newline  now remember this side of the mountain is always dark , because the light is coming from the other side , so try to keep that side a little darker than the other . whoosh , here s another one .  as the image is born , he is sucked back to the first time he saw this place ... newline newline with alaska came more and more happenings . the other one would jump in the driver s seat and off they d go . bob became a legend . no one could drink more , spit farther , shoot straighter or fight harder than bob . he was the life of the party . at night that is . newline newline during the day he was reserved . if you approached him he d engage , but for the most part he was there to do his job and go home . the contrast between the two personas was stark , and at first people were put off by it , but as bob came out more they figured  that s just bob , he s a party animal , but he s got his shit together  . oh how little they knew . newline newline  let s pull some phthalo blue in to this navy . navy is aaalmost black , so bringing some of this bright , happy phthalo in will lighten him up .  blending with the knife he can almost forget . almost ... newline newline soon bob started taking the passenger seat more often than he was driving . he became resigned to leaving control to the other one . he d tried to fight before , once , and ended up losing part of his left index finger as a lesson . it had hurt for years , even after it appeared to be healed , but maybe it was the memory of watching himself cut off his own finger that really hurt so long . newline newline in alaska bob s reputation grew as his antics became hijinks . at work he always got the job done right , and on time , but after work he d either go all out with the guys or completely disappear . it was when he disappeared that people should have asked questions . newline newline  why do nt we give this ridge some trees ?  as if he has a choice .  now pull the bottom of this treeline straight down , later we ll put a river here .  perfect as a picture ... newline newline each time he disappeared , someone else did too . alaska is a big place . people get lost . easily explained . but the rash of disappearances stretching from the mid to lateseventies were not strictly getting lost hiking . the other one was responsible for those . newline newline after 20 years of service , bob retired . in the magic of oil painting he d found a kindred spirit , another one with an other one . mr. alexander was able to reshape the way bob viewed it , and he was finally able to put the horror of the past behind him by recreating the scenes where they d taken place ... painting the ugly over with snow and happy trees . newline newline of the 148 disappearances it was responsible for , only around 50 were ever painted . it was always winter , and if you search carefully , you can find the clues he left before his time was up . newline newline  always make sure to clean your brush . we ve got our odorless thinner here , dip it and just beat the heck out of it .  he chuckles as always after this line , watching the thinner splash back toward the camera operator .  and that , my friends , is all for today . happy painting , and god bless . i do nt quite understand what that girl was saying when she grabbed me in the mall and told me he knows , do nt go home .  although i do have a suspicion ... newline newline see , my husband has been growing violently drunk ever since he was laid off from work and i was the bread winner in the house now . i always loved him , i really did ... until he gave me a black eye . whatever love i had for him disappeared that day . he was charged for domestic abuse and battery and spent a month in jail . newline newline during that time , a young man recently assigned to my office named adam and i ... well , i do nt know . we ... connected , i suppose . it was a late night coffee and then two days later , a fancy restaurant in the central financing district . i only realized i was having an affair after but ... i was nt that upset , really . i was actually going to file for divorce while he was in prison . newline newline when he had been released , i had already moved out of the apartment and into my own place . i sent a lawyer over to serve him the divorce papers and i had arranged with adam to meet me in my apartment later that day . then i met that girl , she gave me the warning and i called adam to rearrange at the last minute . newline newline so , she was a precog , then ? i have to thank her . if i had gone home , then he d have murdered me then himself , right officer ?tonight is the night i finally build the courage to ask a woman out . the corner bar is nt the ideal place to find a partner , but it s certainly the easiest . soon i ll make my move ... after a few drinks , of course . newline newline it would seem most of the fish here have already been baited . what s this ? there s a straggler at the end of the bar ! two of them ! if i fail miserably , i ll have a second chance . opportunity is calling my name . newline newline i approach one of them and begin mumbling through an icebreaker i read online . suddenly , the second calls to me and asks me to speak privately in the corner . she asks ,  you can see her too ?  newline newline  what ?  newline newline  you can see her ! that means ... you re like me !  newline newline  what do you mean ... like you ?  newline newline  well , she s dead . you saw her ... that can only mean one thing .  newline newline  i do nt have time for this .  newline newline  you do nt believe me , do you ?  newline newline  no , not really .  newline newline  i ll prove it to you ... just you watch !  newline newline the strange woman approaches the girl at the bar and begins yelling in her ear . the bar girl pays her no mind . newline newline  look , i m not that gullible . the two of you are playing me . i should never have come here . this is what i get for trying .  newline newline the strange woman persists .  okay , watch this ,  she says , as she ... she ... puts her arm through the bar girl s chest ! the woman returns to me in the corner . newline newline  what in the hell ... how d you do that ?  newline newline  go on , see for yourself . give her a feel . i m telling you , she s not really there .  newline newline i ca nt really deny what i just saw , so i obey . i get right up next to the bar girl and reach for her chest . wait a minute ... she s made of flesh ! she s made of flesh and i ve got a handful of her breast ! she gasps and demands to know what the hell i think i m doing . i point to the strange woman  who , at this point , is in the corner , snickering to herself  and declare ,  it was her ! she s fooled me ... somehow !  the bar girl looks over and back at me , puzzled .  who ?  newline newlinelaying on the battlefield , listening to how the sound of the immortals dying  the gasps for breath , the sobs of pain , the whimpering for loved ones  sounded so very much like his own . together , they struggled against the inevitable . fighting for that one last breath with only the hope that some miracle would grant them another . newline newline the cold has already seeped into his bones , filling up the space he supposed should have been warm with blood . it was his folly , his insistence that if his brothers at arms were fighting then he would too . he hadn  t counted on running out of magic , or straining himself too far . he hadn  t counted on their magic being so much stronger than his , their swords sharper , and their immortal bodies able to handle so much more than his . newline newline constantine had never been a fighter . sparring , yes . he could unsword the best of them , lock his foe in a fatal dance that would only end when one had yielded or drawn blood . it was easy then , there was no threat , and you were given time to rest . it was not so in war . he had done well , fought bravely , but in the end he was just a boy of sixteen summers . a boy who had betrayed country and king to chase down the illusion of an enemy for the  greater good  . newline newline somewhere in the distance , someone calls his name . try as he might , he can not will himself to rise . heavy footsteps rush towards him , armor scraping as the wouldbe savior drops to his knees . newline newline and there are tears in constantine  s eyes as he lifts his head , bloodstained hands reaching up to touch his prince s face . newline newline  i  m so sorry  newline newline he does nt get to hear if he is forgiven or not .john woke up at 6:30 , took a shower and got dressed . he made himself an average breakfast of toast on yogurt , and he left for work . as he drove along the same streets he had almost every day before , he listened to the same pop music he listened to before . he almost swore that every song was the same few , written over and over again , but his niece always told him he was just old . newline newline he arrived at work and greeted his boss , a portly middle aged man who smelled of cigarette smoke and beer , and then he sat down at his cubicle . he worked on a powerpoint about investment opportunities until olivia , the woman who worked in the cubicle across from his , got up . as she turned , she flashed a smile at him , her warm brown eyes crinkling at the corners as her auburn brown hair bounced on her back . newline newline john stared in awe for a second , but on a split second decision , he decided to follow after her . he caught up to her in the office breakroom , her back turned to him as she made a cup of tea . he removed his tie and just as she began to turn , he wrapped it around her slender neck . after a few minutes of quiet struggling , she lay dead on the floor . newline newline john left the office soon after . he claimed that a family emergency had come up , and with nothing more than a simple excuse , he disappeared . john forgot about olivia soon after , if he remembered all his victims , his job as a hit man would become difficult , but sometimes he wondered if that little flutter of excitement when he strangled her to death was what people called love . newline newline   okay so that was nt that average   newlinebob knight of elder wood lay gasping for air at my feet . his chest torn open from a single accidental swipe of my wing . a most disappointing sight , i was only trying to sneak out of my cave so as not to disturb him and his sorry bunch of adventurers , if you could call them adventurers . bob is accompanied by a rather crapy group of friends . a half elf who is maybe at most 14 years old , i doubt she even knows the difference between her bow and her arrows . the dwarf of the group is probably 600 years old and so slow he is still charging me 15 minutes after the  battle  started . the last i saw of the druid running around here he was hiding behind the nearest pile of gold with a pungent aroma of feces rising from that area . adventurers used be a fun challenge , i remember the good ole days when teams of 6 highly skilled and accomplished warriors used to come and do battle with me . they would plan for months and try everything to defeat me and steal my hoard . i would not even know they were coming most of the time until they were upon me . men , elves , giants , and all manner of two legged creatures would unite to try and defeat me . they used to sing my name as they died , calling out curses upon me as i swallowed them . they would use ancient dragon magic against me , as they melted from my flames . it would take me months to recover sometimes after those battles . now i am stuck with these buffoons . i get closer to bob and whisper an ancient dragon magic i learned form a very pretty green dragon queen ages ago . his wound began to heal , i say to him ,  bob comeback when you have some real training and adventurers with you .  feeling pity on them i sit down and say  you know what , i ll make you all a deal . i shall teach you how to fight , wield magic and how to defeat any foe . in return you must each teach it to someone else then send them to fight me . if they win you may have my hoard . if they lose i kill you all by pulling you limbs off one by one then healing you and doing it again and again till you lose the will to live and die by your own will .  perhaps in a few years i will have a challenge again , if not i will just go on a rampage destroying every city until they send a worthy opponent .my dad said he granted me some sort of mystical power before i was born . i never understood what he meant by that . a few years later at around 200 b.c , just out of fear , i wanted a big wall being built around the northern border of china . although i was still quite young anyway , my dad listened to me and told his people to build it . to be honest with you , they did nt make it as big as i pleased . newline newline but then as the years passed by , i was bored , so i ran . i ran for dozens and dozens and dozens of years . before you know it , i made my way to greece . this time i had decided to make friends and ended up making lots of em . even gained followers and supporters . newline newline after hearing about the death of my good friend philip , i ran again , this time with my massive army and invaded what he had wanted to invade . newline newline years went by and after i had went through an ongoing series of several battles , i was bored . so i ran . this time , at around 120 b.c , i ran across the edges of the mediterranean sea and found myself in the great city of carthage in 104 b.c . newline newline i wanted to stop running . i got tired , so i decided to settle there for the rest of my life . i was more of a quiet person , although some questioned me if i were to be some sort of famous war hero . i told them i did not know . newline newline this part of my life was boring . the next few hundred years many people started questioning my  age  . i told them i did not know what an age was . they laughed . newline newline i was bored again . newline newline hundreds and hundreds of years later after experiencing death and life , happiness and sadness , i arrived at america where new colonies were to form , somewhere in the early 1600s . i hoped for some new experience and amusement . newline newline but as usual , there was nt much . newline newline it s funny , the years passing by felt so quickly yet so slow . sleeping and eating and laughing.. it was all too boring , you know ? then i hear about civil wars and blah bah blah . newline newline but that s when the new millenium was about to hit . over the course of a few decades i had made myself popular and wellknown . that s when i remembered what i had wanted a millennium ago . a wall . newline newline similar to the wall i had wanted in china , i wanted this one to be more sturdier . like , an actual wall . too bad i had lost my father so he was nt able to tell his people to build this one . newline newline so i wanted to please my fellow americans . i told them of the issues we went through and how to face them with dignity . i even had a new motto . newline newline  make america great again !  newline newline                                                    newline newline this is my first long prompt . great idea for a prompt , op . chugga chugga chugga chugga newline newline jazz s heart beat faster , threatening to explode as the tube approached in the distance . determined , unstoppable , strong . feelings that were nt meant for low lives like him . he stood his ground , if there was one thing he d get right it was going to be this . newline newline  hey get off the tracks mister !  a young boy shouted from the station docks . newline newline the train tracks reverberated under jazz s feet , his head snapped toward the young boy . newline newline  stay back !  he shook his head furiously as the child approached . newline newline a figure clad in purple spandex swooped down from the sky and stood in front of jazz . newline newline the train was only metres away . newline newline  hello my friend , i m elastoman , the evil villian of this town . are you sure this is what you want ?  he shouted the words . newline newline jazz nodded his head . newline newline elastoman disspeared . newline newline  nbsp  newline newline the train squashed him . newline newline carl .  it whispered . the voice was definitely h jon benjamin . newline newline  carl , over here , it s me , celebrity actor h. jon benjamin .  it said more plainly . newline newline  now none of your cheat , jon .  the warrior said , not taking his shit . newline newline  ... you re right . i m sorry . celebrity voice actor , h. jon benjamin .  newline newline it emanated from a shillelagh , an old one , maybe 50ish . it lay in a corner , a fine layer of dust on its handle . newline newline  look , jon . it s nothing personal , i think i m just gon na keep looking .  newline newline  no , wait . dude .  down the hall one could hear another , wise and ancient sounding weapon calling to the warrior .  ignore that guy , he sucks too .  newline newline  yeah , but i want to be taken seriously , and he looks like a cool sword of some  newline  i will not stop until i get you laid .  the shillelagh said , desperate . newline newline the warrior had to stop and reassess . down the hall the fancy glowing sword was calling , louder now .  shh ! shut up over there just a second ! sorry , repeat that last thing ?  newline newline  look , i am awesome at parties . sparkles mcgee over there will give you the power and stuff , whoopdee doo right ? you wan na look cool and kill a bunch of evil all the time , or do you want to be cool all the time , go to ye old tavern with me and walk out with floozies under each arm ?  newline newline  well ... i mean , the evil ones did kill my father ...  newline newline  there is no dad ever lived that would be disappointed in his son honoring his death walking out of a bar with floozies under each arm .  newline newline  ...  newline newline  you ll also notice my handle is very smooth . very . no slivers up in there . i do nt know what you re into

what i m talking about . i am outta this joint ! now , uh , i do nt wan na kiss and tell , but you should get some paper towels , maybe some pledge , my last user was ... thorough .  newlinethe tension was palpable . assassins , mercenaries and drug lords sat arrayed around a circular table . every shadowy organisation or criminal empire in the world sat beneath a temporary truce . a truce that was , as fate would have it , about to break . violence was imminent and they all knew it . all of them , that was , save one . newline newline  alright then , shinodasama .  the man quickly signed his signature across the last sheet before closing the heavy binder . he slid it across the table with a polite smile .  everything looks to be in order but why do nt you take some time to review it while i handle mister mikhailov s request .  the ageing yakuza oyabun nodded silently as one of his kobun quickly snatched the paperwork up . newline newline  is it really necessary for us all to be here ?  sergei was as large as a bear and certainly as grouchy as one . his heavy russian accent made it difficult to discern his words but the the man simply smoothed down his tie with a disapproving look . newline newline  mister mikhailov , you insisted on being seen today .  the admonishment was softly spoken and he continued even as his client blustered in denial .  because you changed the timetable , everyone else demanded to be seen as well .  the assorted underworld figures eyed each other nervously .  i can not understand for the life of me why you all needed your taxes done right this second but i am doing my best to accommodate .  his worry lines deepened and for a moment , everyone sat back with silent concern .  are my efforts unsatisfactory ?  he asked quietly , clicking his titanium pen idly . newline newline  niet ,  . no offence intended .  the vory pakhan assured slowly , hands raised in a placating gesture .  i am just busy man .  he stated weakly , gaining murmurs of support from his bratok . newline newline  we re all busy people , comrade .  jeered a man dressed in modified bdu . he sat with two men flanking him , both dressed in sleek uniforms .  some of us actually have legitimate businesses to run .  his subordinates chuckled at the jab . newline newline  nayemnik ublyudku !  sergei roared and slammed his hands on the table . the room bristled as hands fell to knives and pistols , concealed away beneath vests and suit jackets . newline newline  gentlemen , gentlemen !  their host clapped his hands together loudly .  what is going on with all of you today ?  he asked in confusion . pushing his spectacles further up his nose , the man regarded them all in disappointment .  each of you are typically exemplary clients . i can not understand why you are acting so unruly now .  he sighed and ran a hand across his head , feeling the receding hair with a forlorn thought .  i will attend to your finances with all haste . until then , i expect each of you to act with basic human courtesy .  newline newline the most dangerous members of planet earth s underworld exchanged suspicious glares and muttered beneath their collective breath but they acquiesced reluctantly . as the room returned to a semblance of civility , their host smiled genteelly . who was this man that he could command such an assortment of bad guys and villains ? newline newline his name was ted . he was an accountant .as he felt his sword finally pierce the artery of the fell reptilebeast , krod found himself reflecting on the enormity of his deed . he  d done it . he  d finally slain the beast that decimated his town , taking from him his wife and son . newline newline the creature didn  t know it was dead yet . it was thrashing in agony , spraying its vital fluid onto its surroundings . hanging onto his new sword with all his strength , he twisted around and found hilt of his grandfather  s sword , still protruding from the beast  s flesh where he had lost it , dislodging he massive scale that now served as krod  s shield . although it had caused the beast to retreat from their last engagement , it had provided the only opening in the beast  s otherwise impenetrable armour . this time the monster was finished . newline newline finally the great beast lay still . krod pushed himself back up , somehow still able to support his weight after the epic battle . he retrieved his sword from the gargantuan creature  s flesh , and lay it down next to his grandfather  s blade . the starmetal sword drank the blood still upon it and , as if by magic , became again stronger its blade taking on the scarlet of the beast  s scale . his grandfather  s sword , unfortunately , was irreparably blackened and scored by the time it had spent bathed in the beast  s acidic blood . newline newline that was no matter . as he  d vowed , krod had let nothing stand in his way . when the king forbade him to leave the city , krod led the city into rebellion vacating the throne . after escaping from the emperor  s dungeons , when the princess had professed to him her love , tempting him stop , krod pushed forward . the extremes of the seasons proved unable to faze him . krod looked on them with contempt , for not even a blizzard could dissuade him . he had walked across most of the continent , tracking the beast by the devastation left in its wake . finally it was over . newline newline  well , almost over.  said krod to nobody in particular . he still had a princess to marry . newline newline they re not what you think ash .  newline newline tal was wearing the black tunic of the terran agency . ribbons and boards adorned his chest , each representing a point of pride for the older brother . ash saw only memories of friends lost to the ta . newline newline  funny ,  ash jangled the handcuffs on the table .  considering the present circumstances .  newline newline the interrogation room was cold steel . metal table bolted to the floor , two metal cheers and an observation window . no doubt the generals behind it were watching not just ash but tal , ensuring he remained loyal to the cause . newline newline  we just want to bring order back . make things better for people .  newline newline  like anna ?  newline newline tal glanced at the mirror . he d spent years , working his way up through the ranks , proving his worth . his loyalty . and his stupid younger brother was going to ruin it all . newline newline  that was a long time ago . it does nt matter .  newline newline  your own sister does nt matter ?  newline newline  shut up ,  tal said , standing up . newline newline  do they know ? somehow i do nt think ma and pa registered her birth down at the camp .  newline newline  i said shut up ash !  newline newline  hey you , dipshits ,  ash said , turning to face the anonymous window .  your loyal little soldier ? he ...  newline newline tal was older , bigger and better fed , plus he had four years of military training under his belt . ash had nothing . a street rat who had taken two lowlife tribes of runts and turned them into the premier thorn in the governments side . you did nt win a fight on the street by being better . you won by being smart . newline newline tal swung , missed , overbalanced . ash rose in a single motion , slipping loose his right cuff before pressing it deeply into his brothers neck . newline newline  you saved her life ,  ash whispered into his brother s ear .  that s the only reason i m gon na spare yours .  newline newline as the guards rushed in , crushing ash s body against the wall , he saw tal rub at his neck . they were brothers , both looking out for the same things . they just had different ways of protecting it .remember when you visited us when i was 5 , newline newline how about when we came down to louisiana a few times ? newline newline remember when you used to live in tennessee , newline newline how about all the times you looked out for us when our father s mind was intoxicated ? newline newline remember when we traveled on those large plains on those golden sunny days , newline newline how about when we shared amazing laughs about the silliest things ? newline newline remember when you thought of me as your own son , newline newline how about the moment you hugged me after ? newline newline surely you remember them all now  surely you are reliving those memories now , newline newline as i know i once did . newlinei was so ecstatic i could nt sit still . he was perfect , and anna would be out of surgery soon . i felt like i was very big . i felt as though i was a very large important cog in the universe to be tasked with such an important job . i would raise a son . newline newline i was pacing around the lobby , closer to breaking out into dance than walking though , waiting for my best friend , my big brother to get there . i had brought along two cold imported beers to celebrate and i wanted to share my joy with someone else . newline newline but my brother was running late and i looked around the deserted room for someone else to share with . there was a small woman there with a young looking girl who appeared to be sick . they were speaking in hushed spanish and it did nt look like they wanted company . i do nt know what i was expecting being that it was 4:30 in the morning but i felt like i was going to burst if i did nt get some human interaction . the best thing about joy is sharing it with someone else . newline newline then a man came from the side room where they kept the vending machines . he looked to be about my age as he sat carefully on the edge of a couch . he was holding something in his hand . his face was sort of grey but he looked calm , not upset so i sat next to him and held out a beer . newline newline  here you go buddy , we re celebrating !  newline newline he looked at me for a long moment . he sat so still and looked fragile . he seemed like a very small part of the universe , a cog that had been forgotten about , a cog that was no longer needed . newline newline  i ...  his voice cracked . newline newline shit . newline newline he gestured to show me what he held in his hand . it was a pack of starbursts candy . newline newline  after i finish eating these i m going to go say goodbye to my son . he s going to die today . i m going to kill him . well i m not but i m going to pull the plug . honestly he s been dead for about a week . he wo nt come out of the coma . my wife is nt here ...  newline newline he trailed off . newline newline my heart fell into the pit of my stomach . no this is nt right . this day is nt about death . this is nt the same day . we re sitting right next to each other but we re not in the same day . newline newline  so what are we celebrating ?  newline newline  i..i..i..  newline newline i do nt know what to say . he opens the packet of candy and takes out the first one . they are all individually wrapped . he unwraps it and looks at me . he pops the candy into his mouth . newline newline  i am so sorry .  i finally stutter out .  i ca nt imagine ...  newline newline he nods his head a few beats .  yeah .  he says slowly . he unwraps and pops another candy into his mouth . i want to tell him to slow down . newline newline  how ... ?  i say slowly . newline newline  cancer .  he says . of course . newline newline  what are we celebrating ?  he says again . newline newline i want to tell him to go away .  nothing .  i say while shaking my head . newline newline  time goes by really fast . sometimes you ll feel like you re in control but you never are . time is the fourth dimension you know ? we literally move through it . but i think we fall through it . you can control your movements but not when you re falling . you ca nt control it , you re falling through time and you only stop falling ...  newline newline he has eaten four of the candies now . newline newline he crinkles his eyes and exhales a puff of air . it s the ghost of a laugh . newline newline  well they say it s not the fall that kills you it s the sudden stop at the end .  newline newline i look at my hands , they re covered in sweat . i have never been so uncomfortable in my life . newline newline  i m sorry  i say standing up and backing away from him ,  i have to go .  newline newline he nods staring at his candy . there s three left . newline newline i hurry into the warmth of the maternity ward out of that cold lonely space in the lobby . newline newline the day rushes by . first feeding , first burp , first crying , first diaper change . then second feeding , second burp ... wait was it the third burp ? i really ca nt keep up . family comes and goes , everyone oohs and ahhs . 48 hours come and go in a flash . newline newline as we walk out of the hospital laden down in gifts and happy wishes from the staff i get the urge to dig my heels in . it feels like i m falling . newline newline newlinei stretched , adjusted my headset , and yawned . on the one hand , it was great that the mission floor was so dim  my head was pounding . on the other hand , i was about to fall asleep . newline newline  hendricks , we got connection yet ?  i said , speaking into my mic . henny was right across the aisle , but we never took the headsets off on the mission floor and it was habit . as if in response , static filled my ears . henny gave me a thumbs up . newline newline i turned to my station and started listening  and watching . newline newline the somnolent simulation experimental agency was established in 1946 . thanks to some think tank breakthrough  still way too classified even for us ops to know the details  big brother could both broadcast and observe civilian dreams . newline newline on the screens in front of me , i watched a score of regular joes and janes . looked like henny had put me on naked exam that you did nt study for duty . ugh . it was easiest to watch twenty people having the same dream . easier to pick out the lucids , and easier yet to see  if it ever happened  what we were looking for . newline newline on the mission floor , 900 other ops were doing the same thing i was . newline newline i peeked over at henny s screen , and opened an im window . newline newline  op729 : you bitch . you gave me naked exams and took threesome with twins ? ! newline newline henny turned and laughed . i could nt hear it , but i knew her bright , amused , unrepentant laugh well and just seeing her throw her head back , the bounce of her ponytail , made me smile . newline newline back to the dreams . no lucids here , and while we were nt real sure what our mission was , we had parameters to follow . nonlucids were worthless . newline newline i hit a key to refresh my feeds with a new batch . jesus , how many people were getting naked exam broadcast tonight ? newline newline i felt myself starting to doze . glanced at the time . coffee run should be soon . thank god . newline newline no lucids in this bunch either . i did nt refresh , and instead watched henny . my feelings for her were becoming problematic . not because she did nt return them  i did nt know one way or another if she did  but because i did nt want to have them . she was a bright spot in my day , a ray of sunshine in this dark , overairconditioned bunker we spent too many hours in . i did nt want to risk losing that . pretty much everything else sucked . newline newline she noticed me watching her and smiled .  coffee ?  she mouthed , not bothering to key her mic . i nodded desperately . she opened an im window and typed to someone , one of the trainees , most likely , then signed  ok  with a grin to me . i grinned back . she s an angel , i thought . newline newline she watched her station . i could nt make out which dream it was . there were hundreds of templates , though , so that was nt surprising . she tilted her head to the side , curiously , then enlarged one of the windows . newline newline she started typing furiously . i was surprised to hear an alert on my own machine and turned back to my station to see what she was saying . newline newline  op765 : rinker , what the fuck ? newline newline i blinked . huh ? so she caught me staring ? we stared at each other all the time , what was she on about . newline newline  op729 : sorry hen , just spacey today , not enough sleep . newline newline  op765 : this ca nt be happening . we do nt have chips ! newline newline chips were implanted in civs at birth to enable them to receive broadcast dreams and transmit their experiences . newline newline  op729 : what ca nt be happening ? what are you talking about ? newline newline i turned to wave her over and get her to just explain , but she was nt at her chair . in fact , no one was . i was alone on the floor . fear slid down through my spine and back up again , and i shuddered . newline newline  op729 : what the fuck is going on ? newline newline  op765 : you tell me ! ! ! newline newline  op729 : where did everyone go ? ? where are you hen ? newline newline  op765 : god i do nt know what to do . this is outside of all of the parameters . newline newline i stood up and slowly looked around again . everyone was just gone . screens were still lit , dreams were still playing , but i was alone . newline newline  henny !  i yelled .  this is nt fucking funny anymore .  it actually would have been a great prank , normally , but the sick fearful feeling i could nt shake sucked all of the humor out of it for me . newline newline that s when everything went black . i screamed . there were hardly any lights on on the floor to start with , but the screens kept the room relatively well lit . now i could nt see anything  it s not like the bunker had windows . i sat back down hurriedly , fumbling for my keyboard , but my screen was as black as everything else . newline newline  henny !  i said .  cut this the fuck out ! show yourself ! now ,  i said , and i was ashamed of the panic in my voice but i could nt help it . newline newline my screen flickered . i watched with confusion as a pixelated stream cleared to reveal ... henny . up close and personal , and i could see the ops room , packed with people , behind her . her face was lit blue and washed out from the screen . other ops were gathered around , mouths slack . i could see the reflection of my face in her eyes . newline newline she typed something  i could hear the keyboard from my speakers , but not across the aisle . and that s when i understood . newline newline  op765 : hi , rink . can you still read this ? newline newline i nodded and she gasped . newline newline  op765 : can you ... can you type back ? newline newline i shrugged .  let s see ,  i said . newline newline  op729 : henny , this is rink . over and out . newline newline i tapped enter . newline newline she watched the screen with wonder .  can you say aloud what you just typed ? newline newline i repeated it . newline newline  do you know what is happening ?  newline newline i nodded . newline newline  we just got our first hit . and it s me . my bones croaked as i rose up from my bed . i say bed . i d taken a liking to coffins recently , as i figure they go pretty well with my whole image . newline newline i grabbed my fully functional scytheshaped walking stick and went into my bathroom . newline newline peering into the mirror , i saw my face as handsome as ever . from my piercing black eyes to the beautiful white of my face , nobody ever looked as good as me . if you do nt account for the whole skeleton thing . newline newline immortality s a bitch . there s no other way to put it . every single version you can get is cursed . you can be a vampire , forced to live in the shadows , hiding from the light of day . you can be a god , bound by the beliefs of mortals and forced to do their whim  if enough decide on it  . or you can be me , just some random guy that found out one day that he could nt die . newline newline it became known to me when i was fatally injured for the first time . my pack was hunting some wolves , when one of the spearmen missed and impaled me . that hurt . did nt kill me though . unfortunately , it did apparently kill my body . after a few days , my skin was peeling off and my hair was falling out . i did nt bleed anymore . maggots were living in my wound . i could nt feel pain , or really anything . to top it off , i was constantly adjusting my left eye , as it was nt paying attention to my instructions to move at all . after a few years , i was simply bones . another few years , and everyone i knew was dead . a few hundred years , and the world is vastly different and changing . a few thousand years , and civilisation has spread to the corners of the world , and nothing is really magical anymore . newline newline i ca nt explain how i can see , by the way , as i have no eyes , due to being just bones . i ca nt explain how i move either . as i am just bones . noone is able to explain it really . i ve talked to wizards , demons , and even gods , and none can explain it . i am also the only being with this brand of immortality in existence . so there s no past data to go on . newline newline it came to me recently , though . along with a job offer . along with a huge salary , i get a free apartment , and i also get to hang around with other immortals like me . all of us in one organisation , as the natural forces that keep the world together . and i m death . newline newline it s pretty sweet . cool scythe ? check . sick robes ? check . all the things a guy could ask for . to people that hate the killing , it ca nt really be helped . that s one of the reasons i am death , and not people like you . it just does nt phase me . the whole world could die , and all i d care for would be the lack of new content on tv . i could just destroy something else . as i am the one who will end all things , it ll happen eventually . all will die . newline newline apart from me . that s what i hate about this job . it will keep going , until i am all that is left . but until then , at least i get to be a skeleton .i was sitting on my bed , calmly screaming expletives at the irritating video game in front of me . i hear a light tapping from behind me . newline newline  come in ,  i said , not even realizing that i was the only one home . i heard the knock again . newline newline  cone in already , sheesh !  newline newline once again , nobody entered my room , but instead , they knocked a third time . i looked around and saw that my bedroom door was open wide , and there was nobody outside . newline newline the knock sounded a fourth time , and i finally realized that it was coming from my closet . newline newline  the hell ,  i mumbled as i walked over to my closet and threw the door open . newline newline a man wearing a brown suit coat , black slacks and a ridiculous pink bow tie stumbled out from between my shirts . newline newline  oh , hello there ,  he said in a cheerful british accent . newline newline  um , hi ,  i said . i was awestruck that this man had somehow simply appeared in my closet . newline newline  let s see , let s see ,  he said , pacing around my room . he swiped a finger across my desk and licked it . newline newline  hmm . judging by the taste , i m in fargo , north dakota , in the united states , on earth , and it s about ... .2:41 am , september 5th , 2015 ?  newline newline my jaw dropped . newline newline  yeah , that s ... .that s exactly right ,  i said . newline newline  wonderful ,  he exclaimed ,  so i have nt lost my touch yet . still , pretty odd that she d send me here , of all places .  newline newline he turned to me and examined me with a piercing gaze that seemed to go straight into my mind . newline newline  you . what s your name ?  newline newline  um , russell .  newline newline  nice to meet you , um russell . have you seen anything weird around here ? power outages , strange lights in the sky , anything ?  newline newline  not that i know of . and it s just russell .  newline newline  pardon ?  newline newline  my name . it s not um russell ,  it s just russell .  newline newline  oh , of course . just russell . well , just russell , my tardis sent me here for a reason , and i m sure not going to figure it out by sitting in here and enjoying the latest electronic entertainment with you , as much fun as a diversion like that would be . i ve got a town , or city , or state , or country or planet to save , and it wo nt get done from your bedroom . pleasure to meet you though , just russell .  newline newline  right , yeah .  newline newline as he left the room , i called out to him . newline newline  who are you ?  newline newline  i m the doctor .  wait up , mandy ,  she whispered under her breath , her footsteps clapping against the wet paving stones . i heard her call out , but i did nt dare break my stride or turn around looking . i did slow my pace though , ever so slightly , and soon the familiar sound of her footsteps fell in beside mine . newline newline  i love when it rains like this .  i did nt turn to look , but i could hear her smile in the words . and such a smile it was . soft around the edges , with a genuine touch of warmth , and perked up at one corner . she shared her smile with everyone , from teachers to classmates , but it always seemed wider when it was pointed at me . but still i did nt turn to see it . newline newline  you know this is a bad place .  i said to the back of the girl in front of me . i watched as her black woollen jacket swish across the top of black boots , and tried not to think of last night . i could feel my cheeks heating up regardless beneath the cold rain , determined not to look back least someone noticed me blushing .  the citadel is right behind us ,  i reminded her ,  we re in plain sight out here .  newline newline  but that s the best part ,  she said lightly ,  let them look out here , and you know what they ll see ?  she paused to let me jump in . newline newline  just a sea of black umbrellas .  she finished , nonplussed by my silence . and now my feet did miss a step at the implications . i tripped on the stones , sending papers flying to the flooded sidewalk . newline newline biting back tears , i scrambled for the papers before the rain soaked them through , snatching them out from the unyielding paths of black boots . when the last soggy assignment was shoved into my bag , i glanced about for my umbrella . a hand held it out over my raindrenched head as it s partner offered me a boost . her warm smile greeted me , shielded from prying eyes by her own black umbrella . i took her hand cautiously , like one might take a live wire , and she pulled me to my feet . and if that grip lingered a moment or two too long beneath the watchful eyes of the citadel , then no one could see a face as we scurried back to the crowd . just two nameless black figures , huddled against wind and rain .

suicides just in the miami area . but it was nt till the kids , who lived in the pensacola area , that folks started to wig out . 27 deaths in two weeks , according to the news , and no one was even sure if they were all connected or what . but the news needs a story , so they claimed one person was responsible , kinda like some complex crazy sherlock holmes style case where this guy was driving around and killing people in inconspicuous ways that just made them look like jackasses .  the clumsy killer  . me and my buddies , ya see , we pick up the trash in orlando . and i have to say , trash tells you a lot about the person who created it . boy did we have a spike in drinking once this shit started going down . but me personally ? i think it s crap . it s the media blowing things outta proportion , that s what s happening . you read about some dame dying and suddenly 10 people die . why ? because you planted that thought in their heads . worry is what kills people . newline newline  newline newline i put down the phone and touched my wrist . the delicate strand of silver that caressed my skin , given to me by my mother , felt cold now . everyone in atlanta had heard about  the clumsy killer ,  or whatever he was being called these days . i was horrified , living just close enough to the border to give me panic , but i had nt thought my mother was in danger in texas . there was true tensity in the voices of the hosts of npr each morning , as they continued to warn their listeners not to overplay what was happening , as that behavior has encouraged copycats in the past .

they re going out unarmed from the smaller villages , acting mighty freaky . england had to totally shut down their subway on account of so many people falling in and getting crushed or electrocuted or whatever . but i got ta tell you , me and my buddies , we re just fine . taking in a cold brew each night , watching the game , just staying calm is saving our lives . newline newline  newline newline the funeral was completely tasteful , but i did nt understand why a single policeperson had yet to speak to us . it was like the austin authorities believed my mom had truly just tripped and fallen . three more cases in austin just over the weekend  all children choking to death on leftover halloween candy they had hidden . they were triplets . god , the family must be crushed . npr was at a loss for what to say , but they talked more than ever . but no opinions , no suggestions , simply reports cropping up all over the us and internationally . this could nt be a string of copycats . it just could nt . it had to be some kind of organized terrorism force or something . i stroked my silver bracelet and wished i could speak to my mother , have her reassure me as she always had . i needed her strength , her guidance . i had only my father and brother now , both silent , these sturdy creatures completely fractured and unable to cope . newline newline  newline newline one of my hamsters ate my other hamster . now i have only one hamster . i was really sad so my dad bought me a cool snake . my snake s name is rex . rex is cool and his skin is really cold . dad said i ca nt

though he likes eating other hamsters . newline newline  newline newline i m stressing out . i said it , there , i m stressed . not because i think it s some kind of end of days crap , but because of what happened today on my route . charlie was driving and i was loading , and i should ve noticed something was up but i just wanted to get through the day . i just picked up the can , it was heavy but so are most these days , filled up with pizza boxes and beer bottles on account of no one recycles anymore , and just tossed it in . i did nt hear anything at all , but i saw it , i saw it probably a second too late . just this little foot , tiny little toes , the hem of some kind of pajamas around his ankle . i turned everything off , i hollered for charlie , i hollered for god but i knew it was over . the parents tore out of the house like it was on fire , screaming for  justin  , who i guess it took them a while to realize was gone . cops say he had just climbed in the bottom of the can and threw a bag on top of him . his folks had been really lighting each other up about whether or not to get out of the country and justin had just snuck out . he was eight years old , and i

this is alonzo jacob with your monday  weather  report . the heatwave that  slowed  everybody down this weekend is showing  no  signs of letting up this week . our meteorologists suggest that today s temperature could climb to as high as 40  degrees  celsius by the late  afternoon  . right now , only an  hour  after sunrise , the temperature here at the airport is already 29  degrees  . however , there is relatively no  humidity  in the air , so it feels quite comfortable out here at the moment . unfortunately , there is also no  rain  in the forecast for the next five days . this is bad news for the  thirsty  forest fires that are raging across the interior of our province . looks like setting up a tent in the  backyard  may be the only way to catch some sleep tonight if you do nt have air conditioning . that s all for today s  weather  . stay tuned for the morning  traffic  report . this is a true story .  newline newline one summer s day i was cruising a secondary highway with my son in the back seat . this road had seen better days , it barely qualified as paved anymore , but i liked the scenery  it wound through a forest and tracked a river for most of its length . there was rarely traffic , which only provided more time to enjoy the scenery . newline newline as i was driving i saw a large rock in the middle of the road . i rolled to a stop , planning to move the dangerous object out of the way . when i realized what i had found i grabbed a stick from the side of the road , a pair of work gloves from the center console and my son from the car .  watch this ,  i said poking the rock with a stick ,  you ll love it .  newline newline a head lunged out of the rock and bit the end off the stick  dad had found a snapping turtle . my son was impressed by this angry rock once he stopped screaming in terror . i knew it was nt uncommon to find turtles sunning on the highway but i had nt seen a snapping turtle in years . one thing i did remember , however , was a ninefingered neighbor s warning that their beaks are able to cut through nearly anything . newline newline i grabbed the turtle by the sides of the shell while it gnashed and pawed at my gloved hands , trying to reach flesh , but i am proud to say that i am fully capable of overpowering chelydra serpentina ... especially when i have to impress my children . newline newline i carried the little nugget of rage to the edge of the river and set it down in the mud at arm s length , quickly jumping back . snapping turtles are real bastards , and a lot faster than most people give them credit for . the turtle sat in the mud , sizing me up and giving me nasty looks all the while . my son , a fan of nature , sat on the sidelines watching this spectacle . newline newline  daddy ,  he asked me ,  were you scared the turtle was going to bite you ?  newline newline  nah ,  i replied ,  because if he did ... i d bite him back .  newline newline  really ?  just like how you bit the cat when he bit you ?  newline newline  just like that .  newline newline  one good thing , daddy , is that turtles do nt have fur , so you wo nt have to clean your mouth out this time .  jeff ! ! door for you ! ! !  newline newline the lights dim and my breath fogs for just a moment as the room fills with the spirit of complete evil . newline newline i know exactly what s happened , and i know who s at the door . newline newline my younger brother is holding the door open , about to shout for me again as i start down the stairs . he does nt look worried . why would he ? he does nt know the man in the tailored suit standing on our step is the prince of darkness . newline newline i shove my brother to the side and open the door . newline newline  hey !  he grunts .  where have you been all day ?  newline newline i ignore him .  what do you want ?  i ask the tall , slim figure staring unblinking into my parents  house . newline newline he preens for a moment .  oh , you know ...  his voice is low and smooth .  i like to make a courtesy call after a transaction is complete .  he steps into the doorway .  and , of course , collect payment .  newline newline my brother is watching the exchange with interest now .  you cheated me ,  i say , knowing it wo nt make any difference .  and anyway ,  i add feebly ,  i did nt sign anything ...  newline newline he does nt miss a beat .  verbal contracts are quite binding in these areas , i assure you , and anyway  do you mind ?  my brother drops the hem of the unnaturally , lightdrinkingly black suit jacket and puts his hands theatrically , rigidly at his side .  sorry , mister ,  he says , clearly still unimpressed with the embodiment of sin and corruption . newline newline  as i was saying , you agreed to pay for one day of clairvoyant knowledge of all the universe s events . we agreed . we shook hands . we drank a toast to our agreement .  newline newline  hey !  my brother interjects , but i continue ignoring him .  that drink made me sleep through the entire day ! i did nt place a single bet or stock purchase !  newline newline  hey !  my brother says again , scowling at the fallen angel in our living room , who glances at him , annoyed before responding .  in the few seconds before you lost consciousness , i assume you knew how long you d sleep and everything that would transpire while you were unconscious ?  i nod , jaw clenched with futile anger .  well , then our trade was valid and i am owed one soul .  his smile makes my blood run cold . newline newline  typically in these cases , the soul is   newline newline  so you re the devil ?  my brother s face is appraising now , but still not sensibly intimidated . newline newline satan s head whips toward my brother and he snaps ,  this does nt concern you , child .  newline newline his composure returns in an instant .  as i say , the soul is generally held in escrow until your death , whereupon   newline newline  so what do you need extra souls for ?  the sight of a 10yearold boy staring down lucifer would have been funny any other day .  i mean , do you , like , spend them on stuff ? who do you   newline newline  silence !  the devil shrieks , his voice echoing with the suffering of untold spirits from the beginning of time . newline newline his composure is more forced this time ,  whereupon ... i will take full possession in hell . you wo nt notice the difference while it s being held pending   newline newline the devil s teeth clench with a sound like a blade on a whetstone as my brother snorts with laughter and mutters something under his breath . newline newline  what ! ?  he demands , seizing my brother by the sleeve . newline newline the chill leaves me in an instant , and i feel a warm glow in my chest i did nt notice had been with me my entire life . lucifer s eyes dart from me to my brother half a dozen times before his fingers uncurl from the fabric of the bright green tshirt . newline newline  i said , guywhogivesjeffssoulbacksayswhat ?   my brother smiles an innocent smile that s made me punch him a hundred times . never again . newline newline i stand stunned for the longest seconds of my life before murmuring ,  verbal contracts ... are ...  newline newline an angry hiss and the smell of sulphur accompany a blinding flash of cold fire and suddenly the only other person in the room is my brother . newline newline he picks up his video game controller from the coffee table .  mom says to bring up the laundry .  newline i did nt know ?  i thought .  i did nt know what ?  i said aloud and listened as my voice echoed around the empty kitchen into the equally empty living room . ca nt say i m all that surprised though . newline newline i smiled . it could nt be that easy , could it ? no divorce and all of that , but i was prepared for that anyway . no more wife , no more house , no more anything from the looks of things online . that meant no more soul sucking spirit crushing dead end job too . the wicked witch closed all the accounts we both had access to , but that s okay too . she never realized i already knew why we could nt have kids  because she was on birth control and content to let my think it was me . she did nt know about the other assets i had either . she really packed up everything and ran home to her rich parents  estate  where i doubt the security thugs would let me in even if i was interested . newline newline i went to the bedroom and opened the empty closet , opened the hidden panel , removed my extra cash , pistol , and bug out bag , replaced the panel and left . i locked the front door behind me and rode my mountain bike on into the night . newline newline it was a nice night too . cool , clear sky , and all the stars i could see , and i knew exactly where i was going to start my new life . the almost full moon lit the road so that it shined like silver as i sped along . i could nt help but laugh . newline newline free at last . a new mt . rushmore ? that s the stupidest idea i ve ever heard . who are we going to put in there ?  newline newline newline newline  nelson mandela .  newline newline newline newline  good one . ghandi too .  newline newline newline newline  yeah yeah , but see , the chinese and the russians will want someone too . do we really want to see stalin and mao up there with the others ?  newline newline newline newline  you racist .  newline newline newline newline  ok , i m sorry , that was a low blow . but seriously ... who s going to decide who goes up there ?  newline newline newline newline  we vote .  newline newline newline newline  what , a worldwide election ?  newline newline newline newline  it s not like there s a lot of us left . it d be like the federal elections of a country the size of belgium anno 2024 .  newline newline newline newline  why the fuck does everyone keep comparing everything with belgium ?  newline newline newline newline  what do you have against belgium ?  newline newline newline newline  nothing , it s just that the fact that shithole got blasted off the face of the earth , along with the netherlands and parts of northern france and cornwall , does nt seem to sadden me as much as the rest of you .  newline newline newline newline  fuck you , man . i loved belgium . they had some great chocolate there .  newline newline newline newline  i always had a soft spot for cornwall , myself .  newline newline newline newline  fuck you guys . stop using belgium as a unit of measurement , it s hacky and sentimental . you re supposed to be survivors . reminiscing about chocolate is nt going to get you anywhere.  newline newline newline newline  well , nothing is going to get us anywhere . we re stuck in these reservations , waiting until the aliens get sick of us , or the human race dies out because of infertility .  newline newline newline newline  i do nt understand what you guys are bitching about . why do nt we just fuck ourselves silly until the end ? at least we do nt have to worry about birth control !  newline newline newline newline  do you really think hedonism is what made the human race great ? fuck no . we re going to show these pricks what we re made of with one final collective effort . i propose we carve a giant middle finger into the himalaya .  newline newline newline newline  i do nt think they quite understand human body language .  newline newline newline newline  yeah , i do nt really understand them either . why did nt they just kill us all , instead of putting the last men standing in these reservations ?  newline newline newline newline  i think they could nt deal with the drama . apparently , other sapient races do nt make such a fuss when they re enslaved and  or exterminated .  newline newline newline newline  well , if that s the case , maybe we just have to try and keep taunting them . it s not like we ve got anything to lose anyway . middle finger , anyone ?  newline newline newline newline  yeah , seems like an alright idea . i do nt think flipping the bird is a universal human gesture , though .  newline newline newline newline  fuck . do you guys know any surviving anthropologists ?  hey barge ?  newline newline my little sister snuggled close to ward off the chill . the freezers were close . we had set up camp at the borders of gardening  the thick ferns provided ample protection both in the form of blankets and cover from the seesee mercenaries . even across the wide expanse between gardening and frozengoods , we felt the icy wisps . the floors hummed and kept us vigilant . newline newline  we have to stay quiet ,  i said gently .  let the others rest .  persy s protest was almost drowned out by the small eruption of snores and coughs from the others . she looked at me with a raised eyebrow . i chuckled gently .  fine , as long as we speak softer than they snore .  newline newline she asked me for a story . at home , this would spark a lively conversation of clashing opinions and misremembered anecdotes . after all there was no one left alive that remembered the end of the world , and after the liquor set in that was the only story anybody wanted to tell . tonight though , i wanted to give her something that would steel her for the road ahead . newline newline it was her first raid into another department . seesees had brought news of frozengood tipping into civil war , their unbendable codes of conduct being at the crux of the conflict . our department had never taken serious stock of the word of a mercenary before , but times were such that an opportunity to raid the most powerful faction in the closed world was not to be squandered . newline newline  i ll tell you the story of the forevercold ,  i began in a dramatic whisper . persy s eyes shone . a story she had nt heard . newline newline  beyond the jungles of thorns and mowers , past the great walls of knife and fire , lies a cold fortress surrounded by a great moat of ice . a hundred paces across , it has shielded the fortress from outsiders for a century . for a century ago a beautiful castle of glass stood as neighbour and friend to the fortress . the people crossed freely into each other s lands on bladed feet . then the forevercold was stolen from the fortress . newline newline  the moat became water and the fortress became enraged . its warriors felt no pain , no fear . they turned their neighbour into dust . shards rained from the sky for a day and a half . the forever cold was found and brought back to the fortress . the moat froze , and shards of the defeated castle became its daggers . newline newline  so now ,  i concluded , staring into persy s wide eyes.  the forevercold sits in the centre of the cold fortress , bringing their food eternal life . its people will give their lives for it and there is not a moment it is nt protected . no one has entered the fortress and lived to tell of it .  newline newline a rustling above the foliage . i shoved persy down into the mulch and unbuttoned the pouch at my belt . i knew the others were ready . the snores had drawn the foolish scouts in . simultaneously we flicked the marbles towards the source of the noise . a hiss , a choking cough and two black figures fell into the makeshift clearing . sleek rectangular cameras were strapped to their heads , faces completely veiled in black . seesees . newline newline persy stood up and came to my side , staring at the still mercenaries .  barge ,  she whispered .  are we going after the forevercold ?  newline  absolutely not ,  fern said .  we re only confirming what their friend told the chief .  she kicked one of the unconscious spies . newline newline persy looked at me , afraid but excited . newline newline  no one has ever lived to tell of it ?  newline newline i smiled .  we re the kids department . we have toys and we know how to play . terror lies around every corner . the few surviving humans huddle in secluded retreats , fending off starvation , plagues and an impressive array of monstrosities from their deepest nightmares . newline newline then , one day , a new terror arrived . gaily clad in the most garishly colored and itchiest of wool sweaters , jetjoknits swept into the camp . her sharp , pointy needles caught the sunlight , sending off gleaming sparks of light . her wild eyes fell upon a young boy , huddled behind a rock .  you look cold ! ! ! you need a ... nosewarmer ! ! ! !  she cackled maniacally . the boy wept as the horrendous , pink pompom was lashed around his face . his mother ran from a nearby cave , desperate to protect her son from the assault , but soon fell prey to jetjoknits  compulsion to cover the world in yarn .  ooooohhhh ! ! ! you look like you could use a scarf ! ! !  the needles clacked ominously and with impossible speed . soon , a multicolored , chunky , bobbled scarf spewed forth and wrapped , snakelike , around the poor woman s neck . newline newline all through the small refuge , survivors found themselves suddenly bedecked with ugly sweaters , illfitting caps , and itchy mittens . jetjoknits showed no mercy . once every inch of the camp was covered in miles of itchy wool , the monster screamed in victory and headed off to find the next pile of victims . well that s kinda funny  i thought to myself . newline newline making sure i read everything i needed to know i dropped the note into the burning fireplace and grabbed a bottle of scotch off the mantle . the house was quiet and only the sound of the occasional passing bus punctuated the silence . pouring myself a glass i looked around at my life . the pictures of places i ve been , friends i made and things i did . newline newline it was all a cover though even if it was real . it was a straightforward business running a franchise outlet . practically ran itself with my assistant manager , nice guy , doing all the real work . this left me to do my real job , taking care of people for my clients . newline newline i sat in my chair and took a deep breath as i sipped my drink . who would want my business guy persona dead ? i was the very model of an upstanding citizen . sure i killed people for a living , but no one knew that and even my clients only communicated with me through intermediaries . i took another sip as i contemplated my options . i had a plan for this contingency actually , fake my own death . the client is happy , i get paid and i could always start a new life . i already had the desiccated body of some homeless guy stashed beneath the floorboards . he matched my build and i smashed his teeth in to ensure he could nt be identified by dental records . it had been a good two years since i put him there but i honestly did nt expect to need him so soon . newline newline i refilled my glass and stood up as the fireplace roared . i took a sip and noted just how good the scotch was . i glanced at the label , it was an expensive brand that i would nt have bought for myself . it was a gift from my assistant manager during our last christmas party . a wry smile crept across my face as i realized the one person with the most to gain from my death was him . i took another sip . he finally grew the stones to make it to the top . i threw the bottle against the fireplace , not in malice or anger , but in pride . flames erupted from the spill and rapidly consumed the surrounding carpet . the drapes started to smolder as i finished my glass in his honor . tossing it into the inferno i grabbed my coat and my silenced pistol . i stepped out just as my house was consumed by flame . newline newline taking one final view of my old life i vanished into the night .if i have feelings i think this one would be called anxiety . the thing i was supposed to feel when i started at a new school in the fourth grade or when i was asking jennifer to prom . but i didn  t . people told me i  d be a great lawyer due to the way i behaved under pressure and this seemed like the ultimate testament to that statement . newline newline newline i watch the file as it  s flipped through , photos scattered on my pristine redwood desktop . i look at them stoically , because i  m a lawyer and that  s just what i do . stare at the pictures , stare at the file , stare at the man in the seat across from me . then i draw in a breath and say  yes  or  no  . no , it  s hopeless . or boring . yes , i  ll take this case . i  ll throw myself into the world of these gruesome murders and help the man or woman accused to walk the streets another day . because that  s just what any good lawyer would do . and i  m the best . newline newline newline the only symptoms of my anxiety are my beating heart and the tension in my throat . each time i swallow , the muscles contract and force the spit back up before conceding and doing their job . and , even as my heart taps so aggressively against my chest wall , i  m excited to see her face again in such a personal setting . newline newline newline hello , nancy . newline newline newline of course , i  d been watching the news . they show her face there every day . each day since they found her and then even more so when they caught him . the man responsible for the recent slew of missing women . these poor , innocent , beautiful girls . poor and wrongfully killed nancy . newline newline newline  yes , just leave the file ,  i state . newline newline newline the man thanks me and writes down the name of an officer and a phone number . then he leaves . in the few seconds before the door closes , i am on edge in an almost erotic way . waiting , waiting , waiting for that click . and then i can breathe again . i can breathe and look at those terribly awful pictures of her horribly disfigured face . her broken body and the just horrific way this heathen of a murderer left her . according to the news , that is . newline newline newline despite my best efforts , he will be found guilty . sorry to ruin the ending . but it  s just not in my best interest to win this one . newline newline newline i spend hours with him , talking through the details of his alibi and finding the obvious flaws in the prosecution  s case . it  s not hard given the fact that this man is innocent . we talk and he cries . he tells me of his wife and child and how much he loves them . those nights that he was out were spent in a hotel room with a married woman . a woman who won  t come forward to testify for him . newline newline newline sad for him , really . even more unfortunate for her . newline newline newline she wasn  t even my type but sometimes it  s not about the fun . it  s about survival . and right now i m not playing the hunter but the trickster . newline newline newline in the end , it was simple really . go to his house and retrieve a few receipts that proved he was a few miles away from the hotel at the time of the murder . leave a little something for his dear wife to find . then wait . newline newline newline  that  s not mine ,  he says to me , crying with such intensity that he can hardly catch his breath , as they pull him from the courtroom . newline newline newline a guilty verdict is hard for any innocent man to hear . but evidence can be so damning and keeping trophies is what gets us all in the end . the necklace from julie . the ring from amanda . the brow piercing from katie . and , of course , the locket with a picture of nancy  s little daughter on one side and a missing picture of nancy , herself , on the other . you just shouldn  t keep those things lying around . as i walk out of the courtroom , i run a finger up the small glossy photograph of nancy in my pocket . newline newline newline i  m a great lawyer . the best . if i had feelings , i  d say i am thrilled and just a teensy bit sentimental .sometimes i wonder what  s wrong with me , because i love you . how can you be this way ? i have tried to see the world as you see it , but i just don  t get it . looking back over the years , i see sociopathic and narcissistic characteristics in the things you have done . you used people you used me . when things got so bad in your home life that you just needed to escape , i took you in and provided for you . i was there for you through all of the bad relationships . but as soon as i was no longer useful to you , you turned your back on me as punishment for being such a horrible person . i suffered those two years that you completely shut me out . when you lifted the ban on me , i walked that delicate line of showing you that i love you , that i was worthy of your attention , while not interfering with your life . newline but you never cared about me . you would tell me what was going on with you , and i celebrated your successes and mourned your tragedies . but when i tried to tell you what was going on with me you accused me of boasting and acting like i was better than you . so i backed off . i let you come to me when you needed me . you neglected me when i needed you . screw what i needed ! newline when i saw that you were headed down a dangerous path , i couldn  t just stand by . you were messing with something you didn  t understand , and you didn  t realize the possible consequences . i tried to give you some gentle guidance , a suggestion that you tread carefully and really look at where you were going . but you continued as always , full speed ahead , seeing only what you wanted to see . maybe i overreacted , getting others involved , but i am not sorry . it got you off of that path before any serious damage was done . it also smashed the last little bit of our relationship . that is when you slammed the door on me . newline but i still love you . even though you have severed all ties . even though you are selfish and petty . even though the last thing you said to me was that i wasn  t the sort of person you hold dear in your life , and you probably wouldn  t even acknowledge me if we passed in the street . i still love you , and i will always love you . you are still my sister . newlineno one knew who he was . i certainly did not . we had all had several cuts on our bodies over our lifespans . my cuts went deep and had riddled my face ugly and my body full of scars . newline but when we saw him ... we were amazed . newline just one scar , one scar that ran his lips . it was like a laughing line , like he had cut it himself ... but he would nt have . why would someone give themselves such a hideous deformity ? newline i watched him as he came to our town . his scar dug deep into his jaw , sliding all the way up to nearly his ears . like when he spoke , he was almost a puppet flapping its mouth . newline i kept my eyes fixated on him , just staring . newline he moved in next door to me and i could hear him howling with laughter in the night . it scared me , but more thrilled . newline i wanted to know why he had that scar ... i wanted to figure out what he had hidden . newline i snuck into his house one night , waiting for him to come home . but all i heard when his footsteps came into the hall of the apartment floor , was scraping and crackling . newline i pulled my gun closer to my arms . i was nt going to kill him , but i felt the feeling that he was going to aim directly at me . newline a scar that deep usually meant murder . it was a very cold world we lived in . newline no essence of good ... no essence of even a conscience . we did nt care who saw our scars . some of us even would tell the story behind the terrible lies we had made in pubs and parties . newline when i saw his doorknob turn , i swallowed , and aimed the gun to the door . newline i could hear the sound of cackling and the man only whispered out on the other side . newline  hello john ...  newline i froze . the gun dropped out of my hand in horror and just as it did the door opened , the gun flipped up to my chin by its own power and shot right across my scratched up face . newline i scampered back in the seat , terrified as the forever laughing scarred smile man looked at me . his black eyes glinting and i blubbered out . newline  who , are you ... ?  newline  who do you think i am ?  newline  the devil !  newline he winked at me , nodding his head and i gasped . i was only cussing at him , but he seemed so sure of himself it scared me to bits . newline he would ve gotten a scar then if he had lied , but he had nt . newline i asked him , as i saw the gun levitate in the air and fly into his hand . he pointed it at me and smiled his giant scarred smile . newline  what did you do ... to get only one scar ... ?  newline i wanted to know before i died , needed to have an answer and he just crooked his head , laughing at me as he slowly began to press his finger down on the trigger . newline  i made the whole world believe i did nt exist .  newline lights out a second later . newline my brains sprayed against the wall . the bonemaker sold his soul fifty years ago in these very woods ,  jacob whispered , holding the flashlight against his chin . his aquiline features looked even more hawklike under the incandescent glow . i took a swig from our stolen bottle of tequila and tried not to shudder as the vile liquid slid down my throat .  and every year from then on , on halloween night , he sacrifices a virgin to appease the devil and keep his soul on earth.  newline newline  which is why we screw on october 30th ,  my boyfriend of three weeks shouted , grabbing the bottle from my hand . uneasy laughter sounded around the campsite . our tents pitched , my head spinning with drink , i didn  t know how much longer i could stay awake . there were six of us tonight . my mom thought i was at a halloween party . my dad , who lived a thousand miles away , didn  t know enough to care . newline newline  that  s the dumbest story i  ve ever heard ,  i said , my eyes closing against my will .  i mean , come on . why  d he sell his soul if all he got out of it was to be trapped in the woods ? sounds like a stupid deal.  newline newline  that wasn  t what he wanted ,  jacob said , shinning the flashlight in my face . i grimaced and shielded my eyes . dick .  his mother had cancer . he sold his soul to save her.  newline newline  i heard it was his sister ,  my boyfriend nick said , leaning back on his arm . he looked good tonight , his blonde hair a curly mess on top of his head , his biceps bulging through his paperthin tshirt . newline newline  whatever ,  jacob said , waving his arm and the flashlight . he yawned , and overexaggerated hugging his date  s shoulder .  welp . i  m beat . ready to call it a night ?  newline newline in seconds , nick and i were alone by the fire . giggles and moans erupted from two of the three tents , and i shifted awkwardly , rubbing a hand over my neck . nick smiled at me , his blue eyes lost to the firelight . newline newline  want to take a walk ?  newline newline my gaze shifted to the darkness beyond the firelight .  out there ?  newline newline  what , you believe that idiotic story ?  newline newline  of course not.  newline newline nick stood and offered his hand .  then come on.  he smiled when i hesitated .  or do you want to go to bed ?  newline newline my face flushed with heat and i slid my fingers into his hand . nick pulled me to my feet and hooked his arm through mine . newline newline  look , sarah ,  he said as soon as we stepped into the trees .  i understand if you  re not ready.  newline newline  no , i am ,  i said , probably too quickly .  i mean , if you are too.  newline newline he laughed , lifting my chin with his index finger .  you know i am.  newline newline my heart fluttering , i turned to lead him back to the camp .  well then  newline newline sharp pressure struck the back of my head . not pain , not exactly , just pressure and weakness . instead of night , the forest flashed brilliant white , and then the ground reached up to swallow me whole . newline newline i felt myself slide across the ground . twigs and pebbles , beetles crawled over my aching flesh . i was moving but not through my own power . my arms stretched out , my head flopped down , distorted images fired in my mind . i heard a scream , realized it was my own , and kept screaming . a sharp pain slashed across my cheek , waking me from my stupor . my eyes fluttered and opened to find nick , his tshirt bloody and covered in filth , standing over me . newline newline i felt dizzy , lightheaded and exposed . my dress was ripped , my legs scratched and bloody . nick had propped me against the base of a large tree , and stepped back without a word . newline newline  nick , what is this ? what  newline newline  shut up ,  he said , lighting a candle . newline newline my hands were bound . i twisted them , feeling panic grow in my chest .  this isn  t funny , nick.  newline newline five more candles lit , he reached for a seventh .  shut up , sarah , or i  ll knock you unconscious again.  newline newline  but what are you  newline newline he turned , a butcher knife in his right hand .  i  d say i  m sorry , but it wouldn  t make a bit of difference.  newline newline i stared at him , at the knife , my head spinning , and somehow stumbled to my feet , the bark of the tree preventing a fall .  you  newline newline  i have to take you apart in pieces ,  he said , stepping closer .  finishing with your eyes and heart . i  ll give you pain killers if you be a good girl , and don  t fight.  newline newline  this isn  t funny ,  i whispered , backing up . newline newline  i  m not laughing , sarah.  newline newline i stared at him , at the dimly glowing altar , seven candles positioned around the base . at the butcher knife . my heart pounded in my throat , adrenaline filling my legs . i turned and ran , screaming for help . before i fled six paces , a sharp hand closed in my scalp , ripping me back . i felt my spine nearly snap , pain slashing through my body as my flesh tore in his grasp . my feet flew upwards and i landed hard , the wind knocked from my lungs . nick stood over me , the butcher knife in his hands , his eyes glowing like a demon . i tried to speak , tried to beg , tried to move , but my body failed me . my arm felt wet i had cut myself on a rock that had jammed itself into my wrist . my fingers reached for it , but before i could grab it , nick jerked me to my feet . i tried to kick him , aiming for his knee as i was taught , but he pivoted , laughing as he threw me to the ground . newline newline  nice try , little girl . but i  ve been doing this a long time . there  s nothing you can do that hasn  t been done before.  newline newline the rock my fingers closed around it , grasping it tight . the bonds had loosened with my fall . even before nick pulled me to my feet , i started sawing at the twine . tears filled my eyes as he pushed me . i fell over and over , purposefully trying to delay . newline newline  so you  re the bonemaker ,  i finally whispered . newline newline  what gave it away ?  he asked with a sneer .  walk , sarah . there  s no use delaying this.  newline newline  and if you don  t get your girl , then what ? satan takes you instead ?  newline newline he pushed me again .  something like that.  newline newline  all this so you could save your sister ?  newline newline he laughed .  i never had a sister . i  m sure i had a mother , but i never met her . eternal youth . that  s what i sold my soul for . since i asked for immortality , i thought satan would never get my soul . pretty smart right ?  he snorted , pushing me again .  seventeen years old , and i thought i could outsmart the devil . but satan loves his loopholes . and they  re a bitch.  newline newline we reached the altar too quickly . my heart pounding , my fingers sawing at the twine , i twisted and tugged trying to free my hands . nick pushed me and i fell , scraping my knees at the foot of the altar . candles glowed around the base , and i rolled , kicking against the altar , my wrists falling over the flame . it took all my will not to cry out in agony as i twisted and burned the already weakened rope . nick approached me , the butcher knife gleaming in his hand , his hair dancing with the light . newline newline  don  t do this ,  i whispered . newline newline a halfsmile creased his lips .  i  ve heard that line fifty times already . it didn  t save them , and it won  t save you.  newline newline  i guess i know that ,  i said , bowing my face . i heard his footsteps , saw his boot , caked in mud , at my knee . newline newline he reached down to grab me .  then let  s get started.  newline newline i wrapped my hand around the burning candle , and jammed it into his right eye . nick screamed in agony as the wax and flame burned his flesh , stumbling back as he clawed at his face . the butcher knife fell from his hand and i lunged for it , burying the blade deep in his chest . nick fell without a sound , his right eye melting in its socket . he didn  t move . blood dripped down the handle . nick was dead . newline newline i started shaking , gasping as i sank to my knees , standing almost instantly . my eyes fell on the black altar , the decades of blood and horror it had witnessed . i wanted to tear down the stones , burn whatever was left , and leave this place to the darkness where it belonged . newline newline nick groaned at my feet . i stumbled back , screaming as he stood and drew a deep breath , the butcher knife stuck in his chest . he wrapped his fingers around the handle and ripped the blade from his heart . a cruel grin split his lips and he growled at me . newline newline  weren  t you listening , sarah ? i  m immortal.  newline hey todd , got a moment ?  james asked as he walked into the dimly lit , albeit corner , office . newline newline  hey jason , how can i help you ?  todd asked . newline newline after processing whether or not to correct him , james responded  well , it s about our new manager ...  newline newline  great guy is nt he ? you do nt find that work ethic in many people these days .  todd said , interrupting . newline newline  well actually..  james attempted to speak again newline newline  yeah , this company is going to go places under his leadership..  newline newline  but ...  newline newline  i mean wow , the numbers are already up ! we re not even taking breaks anymore , i have nt gone home in four days .  newline newline  he s jafar .  newline newline  what ? no .  todd replied , his chin raised , his eyes focused keenly on james  .  not a chance .  newline newline  he s hypnotized us all , that s how he s getting us to work so hard .  newline newline jafar knocked on the window with his staff , todd s eyes widened  but i like working hard .  jafar smiled and walked away . newline newline  see ?  newline newline  see what ?  newline newline  he just hypnotized you !  james cried . newline newline  nooooo , poppycock !  newline newline  where did he even work before ?  james asked . newline newline todd began rifling through his paperwork  let s see here ... . he was a royal vizier , well i mean that s a normal starting position these days , there s a lot of competition out there , you ve got ta have something like that to stand out amongst the crowd !  newline newline  he s jafar .  newline newline  you ca nt just go around the office saying people are jafar , john . that s not okay .  newline newline  not okay john , not okay .  iago said as he flew around the room . newline newline james just pointed at the bird with his finger as his eyes relayed the message of  are you fucking kidding me right now ?  newline newline  look , just give it some time , go have a nice lunch with the guy , he s great , hes..  jafar taps on the glass again  the almighty , the brave , our strong and invincible leader..  jafar walks away  he s got great people skills and a strong presence .  newline newline suddenly the phone rings .  i ve got ta take this ,  todd says .  yes , yes sir , yes , he s here right now . uh huh , great , thanks ... .. he wants to see you .  newlinei was never a religious person . i did not buy the fairytales that people wanted to sell as truth . but then i stumbled on my first discworld book , and got reversereligion instead : the turth about life but written as a fairytale . it was the wisdom of granny , and even greater wisdom of nanny that raised me . it was the unflinching morality of carrot , that made me a good man . it was the thoughtful responsibility and dutifulness of the partician that taught me how to do what is necessary , even when its unpleasant . newline newline and in the end , it was you , sir terry , who with your own life , death , and general cheerfulness about the transition , who taught me to carpe that diem , and enjoy myself while carping it . newline newline thank you , and give my regards to the man in the black cloak .there was nothing like the thrill of the hunt . though he d long left behind the thrum of drums that had made his heart brace for death , he still felt the wild howl on the tip of his tongue just waiting for an opportunity at the moon . luca vaulted over a fallen log and managed to land on the back of the fleeing deer . it was nt his target , but it would help . newline newline the ceremony would not stop him . newline newline he felt the rumble , the earth starting to shift . the deer started to turn to follow the plate s tilt back down , but he turned it s head roughly in the upward direction and gave it a kick . it bleeted in fear , but ran where he directed it to go . newline newline it started to slip as the tilt became too sharp . he tensed , then vaulted forward , just barely grabbing the edge of the plate . his fingers started to slip , but he d failed far too many times . he d rather drop to his death than face them emptyhanded . a nail broke , but he scrabbled up regardless , his calloused feet trying to find some purchase against the rocks . newline newline he finally managed to haul himself up as the plate tilted fully vertical . he did nt bother glancing below at the howls of sounding from his tribe , crying for him to come back down . there was one last step . he readied his picks and looked for an empty spot among the rows of them , some with the hands of their previous owners still clinging on for the dear life they d been robbed of . newline newline the plate began to rumble again , signalling it s fall back . meat and blood splattered on his back as he took the leap . the picks connected with the rock and for one , terrifying moment , they failed to dig in . he could feel himself starting to slip backwards into a free fall , so he used what little grip they had to fling himself farther up , where he grasped onto an ancient axe that had rusted into the rock . newline newline he would nt be able to use this to get farther . luca could hear the plate starting to close again . he did nt have much more time . he gripped the handle of the axe and started swinging himself back and forth . the stone groaned and protested , but he managed to swing himself up and around , just barely manging to stop himself in a headstand by catching a pick farther up with his toes . luca was starting to sweat now , shakily tilting to the side and lowering himself to stand on the handle . it started to loosen , and he did nt wait to move , sailing over to the next set of picks and barely keeping his balance on his toes . he flung out his arms to keep from falling over . the left one nearest the rock walls embedded itself into the sharp edge of a rusted axehead . he snarled in pain and put it back against his chest , cradling it close to his heart . newline newline his pack brother shouted at him from below ,  luca , it s about to close ! just come back ! cora will kill us !  ezra was harder to ignore than his own survival instinct that told him to run . he thumped his chest . he would not be outdone by a rock . newline newline he jumped again , jumping around the edge of the hole , spiraling upwards on the picks of fallen warriors before him . he would not just be a weaver , he was warrior . luca would prove that even the gods were wrong . newline newline there , on the edge , was the metals string , hanging loosely from the daney axe . he pulled out his dagger and cut a piece off . this was all he needed . he howled in victory , feeling tears stabbing at his eyes . luca looked down just in time to watch the plate close . he froze and his stomach dropped . newline newline  biological agents dispensed ,  buzzed a goddess somewhere far above him ,  three minutes until feeding vent is cleansed .  luca looked upwards , the gates to heaven still open . newline newline the last line of picks just barely gave him enough height to reach the edge . so he turned his attention to the daney axe . it was as long as a staff , it would get him close enough . he pulled himself up on it , crying out in pain as splinters stabbed right into the wound on his hand . newline newline  two minutes ,  the goddess helpfully reminded him . newline newline he stood up and realized he was nt tall enough . he d heard that warriors who get trapped behind the plate . the cleansing was so painful that the tribe could hear their screams through the solid rock . he swallowed thickly . newline newline  one minute .  newline newline he did nt think , he just jumped , trying to grab the lip of the gate . he prayed that the goddess trying to help him would guide his soul to safety . he was shocked as his hands connected with the lip , clinging there . his hand shot shocks of pain through luca , so he started pushing himself upwards , trying to ignore it . newline newline he put his hands into the small gap between the razors of heaven . he could feel their sharp edges , tense , so close to snapping luca in half . he used that opening to pull himself up past the gate . he grabbed the edge with his bleeding hand , whimpering in pain , and dragged himself across . newline newline luca landed face first on cool white stone as the razors snapped shut . he heard the termination blast and closed his eyes .  feeding vent closed , cleansing commenced .  luca kissed the smooth rock and let tears roll down his face . newline newline no one had ever made it beyond the gate . not since the revolt . it was too far to go before the plate closed . and the tribe confirmed their deaths by their screaming once it d closed . a skeleton would fall out once the plate opened again . the gods did not take kindly to failure . newline newline luca stood up , still cradling his hand , blood staining the pristine white . it was dark beyond the gate , a light shining down from somewhere far above . it appeared to have railing around the gate , the light flickered . newline newline  we hope you enjoyed the daney feeding experience ,  the goddess gushed . luca wiped his face and looked around . newline newline   newline newline done in the comments . greg , you ve got to be kidding ?  newline newline  no .  i say willfully not adjusting my hat . while i did nt use the dye from the first test batch i sure could have . i ve got a nice head of brownish hair . it s not the jet black of my brother s though . newline newline  anyone who is naturally black haired will see through it in moments .  he says , shaking his head . i did nt think of that . damn it ! he has nt continued to read the paper yet though . he s still staring at me . was my hair getting lighter as he watched ? ! even though i knew that was impossible i fought the urge to pull the hat down farther . newline newline  but ...  he said slowly , setting the morning newspaper aside to pick up the jar of black goop i set before him ,  the blondes wo nt think of that .  newline newline he was grinning now staring at the jar obviously seeing something else entirely . newline newline  greg you re brilliant ! he had only 15 , maybe 20 minutes left . newline newline this had come too far close too close to the wire , the closest he had ever gotten . he was out of reserves , and he had seen no prey in over a week . which is really saying something as it is impossible to hide . it is pretty easy to make out a light in the midst of utter darkness after all . newline newline he walked straight down the middle of the street , he was nt trying to hide from anyone else . he was desperate , he no longer had the luxury to pick his battles , he just needed a battle . newline newline he was down to an inch and a half . he was running now , for no seeming reason , as if coming this close to the end warranted some sort of reaction . it did nt matter really , but it gave him the sense that he was actually fighting it . when really it could nt be fought , it could only be delayed , forestalled . newline newline barely three quarters of an inch left , and then he heard it : crying . not that of a man giving up , but of a child , high pitched and shrill . he turned and ran into the house on the left where the noise was coming from . he kicked open the door , not caring for covertness , and noted the distinct flickering of the flame . he ran up the stairs and turned towards the bedroom , ready to rip the candle from whoever had it . newline newline as he burst into the room however , he saw something that made him stop . not because he felt anything for taking away the light from a mother trying to keep her and her child alive by any means . no one who survived this long had any morals left . he saw the woman with the crying child both sitting next to a candle , the woman clutching a 3 inch blade in her hand . her candle had maybe half an inch left . newline newline as their eyes met , a sense of defeat came over them both . he came over and sat next to her , knowing that there was no point . in their last minutes , they held each other s hand , neither saying a word , neither looking at each other . ironic , how in their last moments of light , they chose not to use their sight . the baby had quieted now , as if it sensed what was coming . newline newline and as both candles flickered out , i descended . they did nt even have time to react . newline newline one can only hide from me for so long until the candle dies out .it was a warm and bright sunday morning in brooklyn , and i was finally here . newline newline i stood outside the door and took a breath , this was it . thirty years i ve been at this , i ve done everything from littering , to assassinating leaders , from ignoring parking tickets , to mass murder . newline newline my trick was do the small ones first , you know , the misdemeanors , started when i got my first parking ticket at sixteen , wanted to get back at the asshole who gave it to me . petty , i know , but what can i say ? i m a petty person . newline newline i ve been to nearly every damn country on this earth , done really bad things , and here i finally was , at the end of my journey . newline newline i already know what i ll do after , made a lot of money from my breif stint as a robber , i ll retire early in the bahamas , was nice the first time i went ... newline newline i have to ask though , was it all worth it ? all the death , all the terrible things i ve done ? newline newline eh , they re done now anyways , no use dwelling . newline newline i picked up my soap and brush and stepped inside to see the donkey that i awaited me in the bathtub . i smiled . newline newline brooklyn was amazing on a sunday ...my hands are tied , she thought . she could tell before even opening her eyes that she was in a damp , dim room . as she stirred , one of the men across from her called across in a deep , quiet voice ,  we know what ya been upt in the wood out east.  newline newline no doubt they had , in fact , seen her coming from that way , she thought . she had been out more and more frequently as of late . as for their knowledge of what she was doing , she doubted very highly that they had seen anything . still , this was far more attention than she ever hoped to get . she remained silent . newline newline  we know ya been askin  fer the moon to come close when she s full . we know yev gone out dancing with devils ,  said a second man , his voice nearly cracking with the last hissing word . newline newline these silly men . they always think everything is devils . they ca nt bear to believe that anything beyond the scope of their understanding is something less than the work of satan himself . but regardless of their ignorance , they ve already caused too much trouble . newline newline the heaviest of the four men stood up now and looked at the girl . he wiped his bald head of sweat and said , in as dark and commanding a voice as he could muster ,  as chief magistrate of the court of salem , how do you plead to the charge of witchcraft ?  newline newline her eyes opened finally and the men could see that her eyes held almost no color at all . they were almost completely black .  guilty ,  snapped the young girl , quickly raising her now unbound hands from behind the chair . she reached out towards the group of men , mouth muttering and fingers tracing wild lines through the air .  but how exactly ,  she asked ,  do you plan to stop me ? it was a day like any other day . newline newline and i was in charge of more than someone my age should be , a symbol of my advanced specialness even at my tender age of 16 . i had hair , so much hair , undulating in the wind since we ca nt have awesome capes in this place . newline newline i wore the same clothes as everyone else , yet different , and my job today was to be ambassador for an entire culture to another entire culture . again , i am young but clearly i am ready for this . because i m special . newline newline when i meet the group , i am in the middle of diplomatic diplomacy when bombs start to fall , and my world is one of panic and screaming . i save people and feel like a hero . newline  newline i wake up in a cold sweat and check my phone . thank god , it was just a dream during that shitty fever i had last night ...and now the 7 oclock news . with your anchors , tim rottinson and melisa anders . newline newline tim : good evening and thank you for joining us . newline newline melisa : thanks indeed , unfortunately we have some rather grim news this evening . officials are sorting through the wreckage of the downed flight 347 bound for new york . all 254 passengers were killed in the first rejection of a sacrifice to the sky king , swyilk in over a decade . the c.e.o of dawn to dusk airliners , dan frante had this to say in a press release just an hour ago . newline newline dan frante : i  d like to say first off that we here at dawn to dusk airliners accept full responsibility for this tragedy and our hearts go out to the friends and family of the victims . i  d like to get straight to it and give the companies official record of the events leading up to the sky king seeing fit to destroy flight 347 . at 12 o  clock the flight began loading passengers . as the flight was loading the sacrificial clearance team was preparing the usual sacrifice of 20 cattle to the sky king so that he may permit our temporary presence in his domain . newline as he ate the cows he seemed to give the usual signs that say he accepted our sacrifice  i.e . his tail changing color from red to blue and his spins on his back folding down .  the flight began take off procedures at 12:30 and was in swyilk  s domain by 12:35 . the usual procedure for sacrifice to the sky king is to lightly sedate the cows so they are not spooked by the presence of the great king but it seemed that the batch of sedatives we used was expired and thus less potent . as the sky king ate , one of the cows became spooked by the great teeth of swyilk and ran away into a nearby electric fence and was killed immediately . newline newline as we all know the sky king only eats live prey . newline newline enraged , swyilk roared with such force that our sacrificial clearance team were all knocked unconscious and were unable to get him a backup cow . newline newline with an incomplete sacrifice , swyilk took to the skies and in the blink of an eye incinerated flight 347 with all 254 passenger on board . newline newline tim : no doubt do we need to remind you folks about the last time swyilk rejected a sacrifice . in 2017 , the entirety of the hong kong international airport was burnt to the ground in flash fire from his gaping maw after he found one of his cows was actually a male . all responding military aircraft were also devoured as he saw fit to show us his immense and unending power . 769 people lost their lives in the rampage . newline newline melisa : we here at channel 9 news would like to say that our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by the incompetence of dawn to dusk airlines . newline newline  newline ok , so i guess i had a bit of a different idea than the others here . im sorry if this didnt fit the bill . be gentle , its my first time posting here ! q.q left . no , left . to the left .  newline newline i got myself caught on a fence again . fortunately , it was only waisthigh . unfortunately , it was also full of barbed wire . which meant i was going to be here a while . newline newline that bite took all control away from me  nowadays i feel like i m driving a tank by giving directions with flags a mile away . all i can get myself to do is follow simple commands , and yet i still refuse to follow them like a proud twoyearold . newline newline  god , i am such a toddler ,  i groaned to my decaying body . me , being the complete braindead man that i am , moaned something incoherent . never knew i spoke two languages until i rediscovered myself . newline newline it took me weeks to track myself down . could nt even use google , thanks apocalypse . i was so relieved to see my lovely face  it was better back in my prime , trust me  , but now it s been almost two months . all i want is some better controls to keep my ass out of trouble andor actual death . newline newline it took until sunset to break free of the wired ground , which left me with about an hour until i could nt see anymore  shame my glasses did nt stay on my face when i got bit . newline newline at the least i was able to think  i let myself wander in the bushes and trip over my own feet while i sat around and thought about my next move . i d already fled the city , and i d already found a way to never need to find food again . i could nt really place what was next on my bucket list for the afterlife . newline newline i really hope i m not stuck wandering with my idiocy .there was little but the sound of his breathing when the men entered . it was crumbling under a ragged wheeze and his lungs sounded like charcoal briquettes made vocal by the flames of an unquenchable deity . they filled the roast pepper green of the railway apartment and they stood close to the door , mindful of some invisible line they all felt drawn there in the sawdust . newline he faced away from them , shoulders hanging from the stark tenting of spine . emaciated and riddled with scars , the skin below his wildcarrot hair paled in the rattling flourescent light . he looked washed in lye . newline newline  did you find them ?  newline newline a tall one stepped forward and the others stepped back , just a little bit to allow for fear and doubt . both hung in the air like their thick breath . newline newline  they re saying he fled , but they re also  newline the man stopped . this was all a little above his station . crime does nt pay enough , he thought . newline  they re saying it was you .  newline newline the joker rose as the tall man and everyone in the room began to feel smaller than fleas , dwarfed by horror . newline newline he turned to them , cheeks streaked with wretched tears and blood and scars of paint and lampblack . newline newline  that s funny . title : 2:30 am newline title : on a monday newline title : kings landing , westeros newline over titles , we hear : newline jaime  v.o .  newline then i say to her ,  not for all the gold in king s landing ?  . newline king s guard 1  v.o .  newline and that did it ? newline jaime  v.o .  newline not as well as my backhand . newline fade in : newline int . throne room  night newline jaime , cersei and two king s guard stand around . newline cersei newline must we all know where you bury your family jewels and how much family gold you use to do so ? newline jaime newline she is just jealous . as pretty as my sister is she is my sister . newline guard 1 newline is that an issue now ? newline jaime and cersei newline what ? newline guard 2 newline oh we have to check by ... not here ... newline newline exit guards . newline newline newline cersei newline that is on you . newline jaime newline so be it , but if that is on me ... would it kill you to learn a thing or two from it . newline cersei newline what is that supposed to mean ? newline jaime newline i m just saying , you ve been drier than a dothraki s feet since the kids died . newline cersei newline ... newline jaime newline do nt take offense , i m just saying ... it s been awhile since we burned through them and we should probably make a few more . newline exit cersei newline jaime newline is this about what the guards said ? i ca nt kill every guard in king s landing cersei ... newline newline cue title card :   jaime kills every guard in king s landing   newline newline open on a large room . tyrion , greyworm and dany stand around . newline tyrion newline so to recap ... the city is in need of slaves . newline dany newline the city is in want . newline tyrion newline need or want is subjective , they can want , but if there is enough of them then we need . and if that happens , and you agree the city needs us and we need our heads then ... the city is in need of slaves . newline greyworm newline slavery is a sickness , an addiction . it is evil . newline tyrion newline that may very well be , but times like this call for balls of brass . or balls in general really . newline dany newline enough . we ca nt enslave people . newline tyrion newline we do nt have to . enslaving people is wrong , but newline dany newline but ? newline tyrion newline we could buy slaves . those people are already slaves . thus we do nt enslave them . newline actually if we are nice to them ... we could make their existence better . newline a slow road to freeing them . we just make them a withdrawal slave . newline dany newline withdrawal slavery ? newline tyrion newline to stave off the riots , beheadings and murder rapes that are inevitable otherwise . newline greyworm newline or we do nt resort to slavery . newline tyrion newline if you are nt attached to your head then we can sort that for you , but i am to mine and so i d like to think about this a little more . newline slavery is bad , but so is being castrated by an angry mob . newline dany newline just so we are clear ... we are buying slaves . newline tyrion newline buying slaves . newline greyworm newline you re buying slaves ? newline dany newline but we are going to free them . newline tyrion newline not yet . newline greyworm newline but soon . newline dany newline very soon . newline tyrion newline stick with soon ... i do nt want to commit to anything too fast . newlineaniva crept silently along the white sand , using boulders almost her height as support . they were her boulders , her sand  the trees in the distance were hers  and the valley below , the rumbling valley that brought her sister to the ledge with a curious stance to see below ? it was theirs . newline newline  how many ?  aniva asked . newline newline keltie considered the question .  by my count , there s four regiments retreating emptyhanded .  newline newline  do they bear battle marks ?  newline newline  a few . some lost limbs , some open wounds . one drags himself on hands and knees .  newline newline  your handiwork ?  newline newline  i said he has his hands and knees , sister .  newline newline aniva could nt help but smirk .  what of the six other regiments ?  newline newline  to be burned in this same valley immediately upon their brothers  retreat .  newline newline  at father s orders ?  newline newline  of course . he wishes for them to remember the smell of burning flesh and metal the next time they consider our lands .  newline newline  excellent .  aniva walked to her sister s side , holding her hand as they watched the army escape . the next time , they would not be so lucky . the crowd outside has reached bedlam . and by that i mean it hasn  t.  newline newline newline police chief petunia was stumped . he cradled his soy milk halfcaf delicately in his manicured fingers . newline newline newline  when i first joined the force these kids meant business . they were up in arms , sticking rose petals in carbines or sitting at the counter of woolworth  s . sinisterly . just waiting for a nightstick to the midsection or a fire hose blast to the sternum . bring me the new recruit.  newline newline newline police chief petunia took a sip from his drink , furrowed his brow , and then tore the lid off of a sugar dispenser filled with low calorie artificial sweetener labeled  organic.  he poured the majority of the contents into his drink . it immediately crystallized into some form of viscous sludge . a meek young man , just a few days removed from his 18th birthday , ambled towards him . newline newline newline  h hello chief . i don  t know why officer stacy thought my hands were down my uniform but i can assure you  newline newline newline  enough . we have a job for you , cadet deefus . i  ve been chief of police here in stagsack for 28 years , and never have i seen a protest like this . these kids are so placid . so calm . they must be stopped.  newline newline newline cadet deefus stood there , smallarmed and softbellied , his slack jaw hanging in direct parallel to his delicate unibrow . newline newline newline  s stopped , sir ?  newline newline newline police chief petunia strolled over to a locker with a menacing looking exterior lock . he gently tugged at it and it snapped open . he reached inside the locker and pulled out various articles of clothing . newline newline newline  here is your riot gear , cadet . you  re going out to the front lines . we can  t assure your safety but we can assure you that a reasonably priced plaque will be hung in your honor . haven  t you always wanted to be a hero , son ?  newline newline newline cadet deefus stuck out his gaunt arms , collecting the riot gear from police chief petunia . a pair of lensless hornrimmed glasses . a green cardigan . a tight pair of khakis . and most importantly , wingtips . newline newline newline  put these on . report to the front lines . when i give you the signal , you charge.  newline newline newline  ch charge the protestors , sir ? but they  re just sitting there  newline newline newline  if i wanted you to charge them i would have said so ! no . i will be out there with officer stacy and the better half of our k9 unit . i want you to charge towards us !  newline newline newline  s.. sir ?  newline newline newline  you heard me cadet ! now get moving.  newline newline newline a rotund lump formed in cadet deefus  s meager throat . he shrugged his shoulders , removed his uniform and placed the riot gear over his meager frame . the door lightly shook on its hinges as he attempted to slam it on his way out . newline newline newline outside of the police building the crowd had grown complacent . the rally cries of  mock our sins no more !  ceased to ring out through the idyllic vermont rolling hillsides . nobody knew what exactly had precipitated the beginning of this prowingtip protest , and nobody seemed to wonder why . a thin figure gawked at the crowd from inside the door , before being pushed out by a sturdy hand with wellpolished fingernails . newline newline newline  uh uh . up with wingtips !  newline newline newline a quiet rally cry returned the sentiment . newline newline newline  no more moccasins !  newline newline newline a second rally cry , quieter than the first , reaffirmed the notion . newline newline newline cadet deefus cast a furtive glance towards the headquarters , as a squadron of heavily armed officers and hungry german shepherds advanced towards the reclining protestors . police chief petunia raised his riot shield in the air three times  the unmistakable international symbol for  charge at me.  cadet deefus removed a wingtip and tossed it towards the officers , the loafer covering half the distance between his limp wrist and the intimidating legion of officers . the sinewy legs of cadet deefus ran towards the battalion . newline newline newline  fire up the tear gas , boys.  newline newline newline no fewer than three canisters of civil rights grade tear gas sprang out from the officers , landing upon the unsuspecting protestors like artillery fire . one round hit a small dog , who bit the crotch of the closest individual . the prowingtip crowd began coughing , sneezing , choking , vomiting , oozing and crying . a thick fog formed over the crowd and visibility fell to zero . newline newline newline  you know what to do !  newline newline newline cadet deefus had no idea what to do . his eyes burned , his throat was dry , a burning rash was forming on his skin and his dry heaves were causing him severe discomfort . the police pounced upon him , their batons ready . newline newline newline  here  s one right here ! 200 points !  newline newline newline fortunately for cadet deefus he did not suffer long , as he quickly lost consciousness upon reaching his pain threshold . he woke up several days later , in a plastic bed , a bronze plaque dangling from police chief petunia  s supple hands . his name may have been misspelled but his legend will live on forever . newlineit s finally my turn , so let me tell you about my world i listen to you so much . when humans discovered that animals could be turned to men when bitten everything changed . science was quick to isolate the saliva of these carrier humans and it was replicated . however science had no answer for moonlight . newline newline these  werehumans  as they are called always maintained alot of whatever they once were . for a physicall example elephants would usually be around 7  tall when human and mice would fear cats even when towering over them at 45  . few were  people attained the gift of speech when human some even lacking the ability to stand on two legs , all however would look just as human as you or me . some changes were big like war . battles on the full moon were set back to roman times with hell hounds raised in massive military instilations tearing each other to shreds . other changes were small like raccoons becoming men on the full moon and breaking into houses to steal from the refrigerator . newline newline the change that affected me the most was more basic to all creatures than any of these silly psychological things . we all know with all great discoveries one of the first questions asked is ,  can we fuck it ?  the answer was of course a resounding yes . massive brothels open only on full moon sprung up everywhere . prime  companions  were always those that could be in heat , sweet jesus you have not lived until you have fucked something in heat the level of excitement is incredible . i once had a  girl  accidentally break 3 of her own fingers and her nose and just keep on trucking like nothing happened . newline newline it was not long before pets were stolen all over neighborhoods as the pet stores ran out of everything mostly females but some males as well . sex dungeons were constructed with dozens of turtles , snakes , cats , dogs , tarantulas , mice , anything small was stockpiled and fucked . the poor females would despite the problem of interspecies breeding still become pregnant and give birth . with some simple logic you can see where this is going . humane societies nationwide could not deal with all the males coming into their shelters and millions were killed any female of any species was almost always quickly snatched up , the most popular being cats having many desirable features  slender , screamers , can be in heat , small when an animal . most of these females however were usually happy with their arrangements . cats were excited to not have to deal with barbed penis s , ducks were stoked about the lowered level of rape , and on and on most were just happy because they were treated so well . newline newline the men with these large harems and small alike doted over their girls . it was not long before interspecies marriage was legalized , followed by polygamous marriage , and followed lastly by incest . the females were soon allowed to roam free in their animal form . broadened understanding was a side effect for these harem pets and it was not uncommon to see a mouse walk the street and into a house unmolested by the dozens of cats that were her neighbors  well at least on most days full moons everyone was molested  newline newline now this is where my story begins . we re a bit of a miracle if you can believe it . my name is tom well , one of my names and i m a cat . its a one in a million chance we would survive past infancy even less likely to get the kind of grasp on being human i have . outside of a human female s harem i should never be alive . one night i can be safe though and plan usually to no avail . i ve tried locking us in a room with food and water to last , but you always find a way out . i scream at myself as you walk the streets i plead with you from the back of my mind , but the only reply i ever get is ,  i must follow my instincts .  i must mate .  i ve lost half of my tail when we ran from an angry father after deflowering his prize persian daughter , you can see it here where a big chunk of my rear is missing . i ve stolen cats to try and appease myself till the next full moon but it only lasts till the cats you have are pregnant or out of heat . i ve watched through my own eyes as i assault poor females in back alleys , rooftops , old swimming pools and basements . i always pray no one comes and sees me with her or should i say we with they . it s always the most stressful when they scream and they always do when ... i m locked inside them they yowl , they always yowl . it s not uncommon to hear this type of thing , but if someone were to see it is two cats with no human in sight we would be dead . the pure blooded humans do nt take too kindly to someone raping one of their wives or daughters or both especially someone as insignificant and invaluable as me . i ve tried to join female harems on the full moon but a quick up and down with their eyes and a chuckle at my nether regions has me escorted off flanked by clydesdale horses with vazectomies , or if it was a rich woman some kind of sterile whale hulking over me . newline newline it s just not fair humans marry each other and even then they keep their harems . then when whatever little devil spawn they brew up discovers his or her genitals they are given a starter lover like a puppy or with a heavy heart i say a kitten . this time though i think i m safe this time i ll stay put and out of trouble . i ve locked myself in a timed vault i rented with a kidney i sold . they sure will be surprised when the full moon is over . it was so easy too they see a male human with testicals that can sign his name and speak coherently and they just assume i m pure . plus i ve devised a little payback for my mistreatment . i bit a blue whale and led that poor dumb lug to the top of the tallest building i could find . ileft him with a tuna club sandwich in a tupper ware container , he will change long before he can figure out how to open that . looks like im getting a bit furry , are you ready ? dr. jekle it s your turn . some say chaos and balance are two different things in life . chaos brings , the need for order , shouting becomes silent , and ears listen to the wind whispers , becoming studious .  newline the community looked around . smart figures , they understood but skepticism and curiosity tangoed with their taste buds . no one dropped a drool . their minds were watering and their mouths dried in the open jaw layout , basking in lecture . newline  ear buds . that s what started it all . we found an algorithm .  newline the chit chatter cued in . newline  random , it seems , is not so random . we found it is actually very predictable , inevitable even . and when it became more apparent , i started to laugh . i could nt stop ... because i had found god ladies and gentlemen . i found god , turned him into a number and punched him into a calculator .  newline the entire room was quiet . the breathing was quiet . you could hear the faint sound of traffic and shuffling . the shuffling of doors opening outside the walls and the civil gallops of dress shoe d clops panicking with pace . newline  now it is time to say goodbye . i learned that fate dictates ear buds that tangle in our pockets the same way that infinity tangles with space . by giving more length , we change nothing , and time travel becomes irrelevant .  newline the researcher began to quiver behind the podium as the walking drew near . newline  you cant stop what i just caused .  newline the community members began to buzz and a few stood up . newline  hell on earth . i just caused a war that will kill us all before there is silence . here they come  newline and there they went . machine gun fire entered the room and took over the algorithm . god was in every bullet . oh god ! not again  newline newline i scramble up out of the alley at twilight . newline newline  no ! not again ! dammit !  newline newline it happened again and now i m left broken , alone , and fearful of the coming moments . newline newline  where the fuck did it go ? how could it leave me like this for the third time this week ? i swear , i almost wish i could leave it behind .  newline newline i venture out in search of it . i pass by crowds of people with their faithful companions and become jealous . how could it do this to me ? why do i keep searching for it ? newline newline  ha ! you are alone !  one screams .  what a fucking loser !  they all start laughing at me . taunting me for what i ve misplaced . i ve grown used to the ridicule . newline newline  hey !  i hear one softly proclaim  it went that way  newline newline she points towards a nearby apartment complex . newline newline she begins to follow me . newline newline we run . we run as fast as we can : through the lobby , up the stairs , searching room by room . newline newline until i see it . it s locked arms in an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar other . the other is missing their s too . newline newline  they look happy .  i tell her . i finally get the chance to see the beautiful shadow that accompanied me to the bedroom . newline newline we get into position and wait for sunrise .i am tired . newline newline truly i am exhausted . i am spent . newline newline i am wiped , i am done , i am at my breaking point . newline newline countless nights of watching these people . countless nights of protecting them from theirselves , whether it be from a corrupt police officer or a scumbag crack head . a stereotypical thug , a mentally disturbed man , it did nt matter . this is not what tires me . newline newline the human race progress and regresses as a society  in classes and location . one day the city drops in crime . things seem peaceful and everything is going your way . one day that can change . newline newline that day is today . the city had been seeing a decrease in criminal activity , particularly gang related activity . i had been doing my best with my partner as we worked on the force together . we protected people , upheld their rights ... shielded them from those whose desire is to bring them harm . namely , the chief of police . newline newline we operated covertly . he could not know that those who oppose him , were of his own . we worked long nights , long days , long weeks , long months and long years . we were grinding away and it paid off . we busted a major crime boss , klein stiglitz . he was incarcerated and jailed until his trial . his syndicate screeched to a halt . the body had lost its head and it knew not where to direct it s step . newline newline my partner died last week , through no result of criminal activity . he was hit by a bus when that metallic monstrosities brakes failed and drove straight through the intersection and into his car . newline newline i mourn for his passing , but i do believe that if he saw what happened today , he would rather he be dead . newline newline years of work , gone . newline newline sacrifice . it was all gone . newline newline the evidence to be presented to the grand jury to indict this man had mysteriously disappeared . tapes had been tampered with , video recordings missing , pictures gone . all that had remained was the one thing i had kept to myself . newline newline the chief had a mistress . through his mistress he communicated with the man we worked so hard to convict . klein s wife would drop her children off with their grandparents when she was busy . the chief s mistress was the grandparents granddaughter . when she dropped the kids off , she would drop off a package for the chief . his mistress would deliver the package to the chief . we never knew what was in the package . we intercepted it one day . newline newline ledgers . numbers . bank accounts . contacts , phone numbers , transactions and more . stiglitz was working with the chief . paying him off , to let his operation continue . this operation that killed so many people , that endangered the lives of many and increased the fear of ordinary citizens . newline newline when we arrested stiglitz , we did not present evidence to convict the chief as well . we anticipated this , so when all the evidence went missing or was considered invalid , i knew i had my last card . newline newline my contingency plan . newline newline i submitted the evidence . the evidence was dismissed . as was i . it was nt admissible in court because of how it was obtained . newline newline that s when i looked at my life and i saw that upholding the law only had its temporary benefits . society can progress and regress itself . it was beginning to regress itself again . newline newline i am tired . newline newline two days after stiglitz was released , i followed him back to his house . i tracked his car and from there he made a trip upstate to the country . three hours of driving and he arrived at his destination . a heavily guarded , fenced off estate . it was a rather late property and i did nt even have to guess who it belonged to . newline newline i situated myself on the eastern side of this compound and wait for the night to fall . when the sun would rise , i would finally have some closure . my life s work would nt be meaningless . newline newline with my suit made of leaves and ferns , i blended into the night perfectly . i loaded up my suppressed .22 rifle with my subsonic ammunition . i had wrapped and tucker taped wall insulation all around this rifle . stealth was key . my only drawback was i had to make any shots within roughly 100 yards . this ammo was designed for small game hunting . if my aim was true though , i could make it work . newline newline two guards on patrol . i waited for them to walk by me , only a 100 yards away . the first one i shot in the back of the neck . he fell immediately , which prompted his partner to attend to him immediately . he did nt hear my bullet . he dropped . newline newline i grabbed their card keys and scaled the fence . once inside the property gates , i made my way to the backside of the house . i encountered 3 guards , 3 that i put to sleep . newline newline i could see my targets . the chief and stiglitz . together they laughed and drank . i d imagine they were rejoicing and laughing at my attempts to convict the both of them . newline newline i knew i could nt just enter the house . it seemed that they were the only ones in there , but i was proven wrong as i saw the guards make their rounds around the house . so i cut the power to the house , by switching the breakers off and then on again . that prompted a guard to come check the breaker box . as he came to check the box , i put him to sleep . using his radio i assured the rest of the guards that situation was under control . i took his toque that he was wearing and i entered the house . i could nt kill everyone but i could get them and make an escape . newline newline i slowly made my over through the house and i saw them . sitting down and talking , enjoying themselves , discussing what else they would do . i stayed back and out of sight . that s when the chief made his move . you can only drink so much before you need to use the bathroom . he left the room and stiglitz attended to his phone . i shot him . his head slumped back and his body went limp . not a sound came from his body and only a sharp tick came from the hammer striking my bullet . newline newline the normal me would have tried to bring him to justice first . he would need to stand trial and society could deem him his punishment . but i did nt care . i was tired . newline newline the chief returned and i was just standing there , rifle raised , scope zeroed in on the corrupt brain of his . he looked at me and tried to give me this speech on honor and how this would go against everything i worked for . i did nt care . newline newline i was tired . newline newline newline newlinenot just anybody went to pluto . newline newline intersystem travel was expensive , even between the rocky inner planets , so anybody who ever went past the jupiter moons could be boiled down into two types . newline newline researchers , studying rock samples or orbital patterns , and the rich . the richest of the rich . newline newline pluto in particular had a reputation for celebrity activity , being the most remote and therefore the pinnacle of faraway appeal . it took years to get there , and it took just as long to get back , so guests stayed for multiple years at a stretch . pluto estates were worth big money , beyond billionaire money . newline newline even moving supplies to and from pluto took a ridiculous amount of effort , especially when catering to the ... particular crowd that inhabit the planet . ships carrying passengers just as often carried fine martian wine , exquisite jewelry and venusian dresses , alongside oxygen supplies and basic nutritional supplements , and even compliments of servants expected to work on the estate for the duration of the stay . newline newline of course , it was wasteful to keep these estates constantly staffed . instead , the decadent palaces were often mothballed in the years between visits , vast empty halls and ballrooms drained of air and left sterile . it was nt uncommon to send a ship carrying service androids a few months ahead of the guests to  prepare  the estate . newline newline inevitably , there were some eccentric men and women who wished to ski on the surface . but skiing on pluto was nt easy  the planet s unique gravity and temperature requires specialtymade suits for the task , with weighted shoes and insulation to protect against the biting cold . of course , given the type of people who would ever have the opportunity to ski on pluto , the price of a fancy spacesuit was no barrier to entry .another body crumpled to the pavement as the cracking gunshot split the air . newline newline a longfamiliar box rolled out of fingers that only moments ago clutched it so hard the knuckles blanched . even before blood began to mix with the rainwater in the street , some anonymous body snatched up the reflective , thin box before sprinting off into the chaos . newline newline natty watched from her makeshift home in a garbageladen stoop that led up to flats stacked high enough to break the clouds . unnoticed , she crouched , her own precious foil hidden under a knit wool cap , her signs of warning trampled down in the madness . she shifted as the wind picked up , merciless in its frigid bite . she could not hear the bones snapping under her heel , though the feeling was unmistakable . grimacing , she used a corner of her cardboard sign to brush away the pigeon carcass , its chest now caved in , blood running from the small holes in its beak . newline newline the birds had started falling from the sky three days ago , splattering over rooftops and umbrellas , windshields and prams . crows , doves , finches they all simply dropped . it only took an hour for the skies to bleed avian , drenching the manicured town in a macabre display of feathers and gore . newline newline it had to be some solar event , the national oceanic and atmospheric association proclaimed , attempting to settle the global population down . america , mexico , india , iran ... only the poles were unaffected . newline newline natty cried that day . newline newline she d endured the heckling for years . teenagers would wad up the now precious waferthin tin and toss it at her for sport . community outreach constantly stopped their van and urged her to come with them to the shelters where the wireless internet flowed , where with microwaves heating cups of noodles while countless people chattered on cellular phones . she could see it all  the rings of signals humanity did not yet understand , crashing into their bodies like waves on the shore , relentlessly shredding precious particles of their dna . they d wanted her to take pills . hateful little tablets of compressed white powder to counteract her brain s tendency to conspiracy and paranoia . newline newline even when the bees faded out , dead in their apiaries , tiny striped bodies littering gardens and sidewalks , translucent wings gone still though they still caught the light of the sun , no one listened . it was the pesticides , surely . the entomologists were on it , not to worry . a tougher hybrid was being genetically manufactured , and while the crops might suffer that year , there was no need for panic . newline newline natty had collected as many fuzzy little bodies as she could find , filling an old jar with them and burying them in a community lot . a uniformed officer had stopped her as she lay a stone over the hole she d dug with her hands , the damp earth still clinging to the underside of her fingernails .  move along ,  he d warned her , oblivious to the catastrophe happening around them . newline newline there was no officer now . newline newline she pressed her back to her little corner where she d blended in for years , watching the growing pool of crimson black blossom around the young woman who s fingers curled like dead spiders to the grey sky . she pulled her blanket tighter around her shoulders , looking up at the analog clock still powered by kinetic gears , ticking away the time . newline newline just like the little bird she d moved aside , a thin bead slipped from her nose . newline newline it would nt be long now . newline newlineour planet was exhausted . not in a figurative sense , but literally exhausted of resources . we had created a near perfect society , almost a utopia , where the idea of one s needs not being met were archaic . we were able to do this because we had such introspective focus after the first collapse . the wars on the aegin peninsula and domsette region , which were followed by horrible natural disasters of hurricanes and volcanic activity , made people panic and act irrationally , letting the plague spread . newline newline no food , people dying on every road , it was a global catastrophe . intelligent life almost faded from our planet , but luckily an early version of the council was formed . they called themselves overcomers then , as a symbol of our race s will to overcome desperate times . their goal was simple : to eradicate everything that posed a threat to our survival . they lead us out of the grasp of extinction and into the age of discovery . science took leaps and bounds forwards in medicine , machinery , travel , but many separatist views were extinguished . in the last few decades before the second collapse the council had become more open to alternate ideas and became more open to individual freedom . newline newline unfortunately , it was too late . societal focus had been too heavy on providing for everyone . councilsponsored organizations had done great things , inventing cures and preventative measures for all types of diseases , making homes that were resistant to natural disasters , and all manners of infrastructure built across the globe . but no one was tasked to manage our resources until personal liberties were expanded , and even then it was years before anyone noticed that we had so little time left on our clock . newline newline the council tried to mitigate the effects , but to ensure our survival as a species , they themselves implemented the second collapse . by sentencing 90  of the population to cryochambers , they gave us time enough , with the resources we had left , to find another home . and find another home we did , on a planet they called earth  . it was the only planet we could find in time that could sustain us , that we could manage to live on . so we set a course for earth , to save us and our sleeping kin . newline newline we sent a message to these earth people that we were coming to colonize them . that we saw they were intelligent , so we were giving them a chance to leave if they wished . it would take us roughly 100 years from an observer s perspective to get to the planet , but much less actual time for us . this is why my account is rushed , because we have no time left on this vessel . while we planned to systematically annihilate hazardous life on earth with specialized biological strains , the humans of earth have taken a much different approach to combatting us . somehow , they created empty vessels for redirecting mass in space that can then accelerate to any destination . at this moment , asteroids are hurtling towards our craft and our planet . we can not take preventative measures . neither will survive the onslaught . newline newline i do nt know what kind of peaceful species could be so cruelly clever as to devise such massive weapons for this purpose . maybe you do nt truly grasp the weight of the billions of lives you are extinguishing because you ve never had to take intelligent life before . these are foolish hopes of a dying race . we know you are a violent people , so know this of us : we were nt the first intelligent race on our planet . we emerged from their ruins . the dominant species of our planet sent themselves to their deaths with weapons like yours . we of planet caeath can only hope your day of reckoning comes soon . aria , let s go !  my sister melody called . newline newline i sighed and sat up from the ground , wiping away the blades of emerald grass . it was time for god to give us more wisdom . i extended my lush rainbow wings and followed after the sight of the glittering gold of melody s . the wind whipped my hair around my face , and for a moment i felt the pure joy of flight . those thoughts of desire for higher speeds . more dangers . oh how fun flying is ! newline newline newline as we neared the grounds of god s garden , i could smell a thick sweetness wafting up from the ground . it smelled of nectar , blossoms , and happiness . this is the smell of forgiveness . forgiveness for our imperfections , the imperfections we are unable to fix despite our efforts . this is the scent that forgives what we have done . newline newline orbs of sparkling white light slowly drifted from the spider lilies growing from the lush landscape below , traveling above the world we live . melody angled her wings and swooped upwards , catching a falling orb of light in her hands . as it slowly absorbed into her skin , it turned a fire red , and then vanished , like embers in a purification torch . she smiled at me before turning , and flying off to catch more , the race was on . newline newline i flew to my left , and gracefully caught an orb , allowing it to absorb into my skin and fill me with warmth , i moved onto the next one . with each orb of light , i began to feel happier and more carefree . needing not the joy of flying . this place has that effect on people , no matter how happy and innocent you are , you are even more so after you leave . melody always liked coming here , and i do as well . it is such a blessing everything this place does to you .your name was james , and you were broken. newline newline broken , what was that feeling ? when you fall from a high place and feel your blood once you hit the ground ? newline newline when you finally find out your friend harboured another person ? newline newline yeah . newline newline now you were at an all boys sleepover , sitting on the ground , about to confess your deepest , darkest secret . newline newline the boy next to your best friend muttered that he , apparently , had burnt all of his father s cigarettes . wow , true genius right here , people . slow clap , anyone ? no ? newline newline then it was your turn . newline newline  my darkest secret is ... i hung a stuffed toy with a dart and some strings .  newline newline everyone glanced at each other . it was pretty messed up of you , but you were a curious boy back then ... newline newline then it was your best friend s secret . newline newline  my darkest secret ... is that i have a soldier inside of me who knows what i do  newline newline but before your friend greg could continue , arnold , who was sitting to his right , made an outburst . newline newline  that s not your darkest secret ! your darkest secret is that you caught me writing  marcus is a f  on his locker !  then he covered his mouth . newline newline marcus was almost quivering with rage .  you did what ? !  he roared . newline newline then arnold tackled him down , but marcus was strong , and he was close to overpowering arnold , but arnold whacked him on the head with an alarm clock , taking out greg in the process . everyone screamed . newline newline  both of you !  a new voice pierced through the commotion . newline newline you look at the source of the thick , low , gravely voice , who turned out to be a man , whose muscles nearly ripped his military uniform . he was right next to you . newline newline he moved his arm to scratch something on his stubble , and you noticed a cloud of smoke stretching from his black boots to greg s nostrils . huh . you never knew greg smoked .  newline newline that was when you broke . the soldier turned to you , and you backed away , slowly . newline newline then he knelt down on one knee , but you screamed , jumping backwards , and tripped over the windowsill . newline newline falling . you were flying , like the birds . you finally found out what it was like to be free . you were oddly calm . newline newline then you hit the pavement , and felt your leg explode , misting blood all over your hands . newline newline the next time you came to , greg was next to you . newline newline  wait ... what ? yo , dude . i never knew your mom put lsd in out food . or , whatever everyone got high on . what was it , that thing that made us all see that soldier guy ?  newline newline  you got high on life .  was the reply . you promptly fell asleep , there on the pavement , surrounded by everyone . newline newline the next time when you woke , he was there again . the soldier was looking over your wounds , and greg was out like a light . it was just greg , you and the soldier . newline newline you were a wine glass , dropped again and again , and then crushed . newline newline the ambulance siren resounded down the eternal suburbia , and the soldier disappeared .

, mr. grey  you re losing your touch .  newline newline with the name of halmond smith , it was no wonder that good ol halmond was a little ... nutty in the head . he was a brilliant actor , a wonderful singer , but with his own little peculiar quirks . for instance , where he had once enjoyed the show business , he now avoided the limelight as much as possible . the tabloids spent weeks running stories about his legendary encounters with paparazzi  the most recent one involved him dropping the world s second largest water balloon onto a group of photographers and reporters . thank goodness he was rich enough to afford such theatrics . newline newline but halmond tired of this soon after , which is where mr. grey came in . side by side , mr. grey showed an uncanny resemblance to halmond  but as a makeup artist , the deception quickly became complete . now , mr. grey was the one who dealt with the paparazzi , usually in the form of darts , paintball guns , and the occasional fire hose . newline newline but halmond smith soon tired of this too , and was ready to spin things up a bit . newline newline  come upstairs with me , mr. grey  and i ll tell you what i want you to do .  newline newline they sat on the outside balcony , with gave a grand view of halmond s expansive and expensive backyard : carefully tended lawns , a massive swimming pool , a giant sculpted banana . newline newline  quite the view from here , eh ?  newline newline  yes , mr . smith .  newline newline  good . jump .  newline newline  ... why ?  newline newline  is nt it obvious ?  halmond leaned casually against the 50 caliber custommounted paintball gun that guarded the backyard .  it s not enough is it ? the crowds , the cameras , the reporters ... ugh . they ll find out soon , and they ll be all over me !  newline newline  ... i fail to see the reasoning behind this .  newline newline  so i fake my death ! haha ! you jump , they ll find your body splattered beautifully all over

 newline newline  of course ! it s in the contract , is nt it ? look , i even wrote me ... er , you ... a suicide note ! save you the trouble of writing one yourself , hehehe ... here you go .  newline newline mr. grey looked at the note extended to him , than at halmond s face , then at the note again . newline newline  they were right about you , mr . smith .  newline newline  what ? who ?  newline newline  you are insane .  newline newline and with that , mr. grey hoisted him over the railing . he flinched a bit when he heard the crunch as bone met granite , then looked down . newline newline  looks like you were right about one thing , mr . smith .  newline newline the blood seeped out beautifully over the patio . newline newline  tell me , how s paradise from down there ?  newline newline from his car , mr. grey fetched his makeup kit . there was plenty of time before he need call the police .he s ten and there s the ball , and his dog , and meeting her . she was all

twentyfive and falling down drunk , trying too hard to forget that there s no more dog , no more school , no more money . he s eighteen , kissing her sweet mouth on graduation night , enjoying the feel of cheap plastic cloth because it s on her . he s twentytwo and watching her red hair catch the sun as she drives away , too scared to fight for them . he s five and watching his mother kiss his

she asks . newline  why did nt you ?  he answers .earlier today , i was standing at the cash register , minding my own business . when , all of the sudden , i look up and realize that there s a woman crying at the counter . so , naturally , i asked her what was the problem . she said that she just received news that someone had broken into her house and stolen everything of value , including her new diamond engagement ring . apparently , her fiance had been acting strange recently , and she suspected he was in on the robbery , as he would nt answer his phone . i felt really bad , so i reassured her that it would be fine , and that i would help in any way i could . i asked her if she needed anything at the moment , and she hesitated a bit before leaning close and saying ,  well , there is just one thing ...  , to which i said ,  anything .  she then continued with ,  ... ... imma need bout tree fiddy .  it was at this time that i realized that she was in fact about 8 stories

beneath . she watched the same ships that i had gawked at through the transparent structure on his way up . the larger ships were hanging back , barely visible over the horizon . a fleet of smaller ships , gunboats probably , was advancing . newline newline  no decorations this time ?  newline newline she looked down at the crystalline structure as if seeing it for the first time .  no , there

out.  newline newline  they  d never leave and we can  t do without what few traders still do business with us . we don  t have nearly the food stores that we once did.  newline newline i simply nodded . she had driven the kingdom  s primary trading partner out in shame . they had underestimated his connections to the other barons and dukes . what had once been a busy harbor was now almost empty and walled off by ice . newline newline  besides ,  she nodded at the ships ,  who would suffer a kingdom to be ruled by a sorceress ?  newline newline i swallowed , accepting this as the fate of my country .  so this is how it ends.  newline newline  so much for our happily ever after . i was stupid for thinking they  d leave us alone.  she met his eyes .  you know they killed him , right ?  newline newline  the southerner ?  newline newline  yeah , for the charges i levied against him.  newline newline  but those were just to exile him , return him to his country for punishment . why are they here now then ?  he deserved every bit of what he got , trying to kill the royal family and usurp the throne . newline newline she bit her lower lip and turned her back on the fleet that was more than half southerner .  our extrade partner is more persuasive than i guessed , he convinced them the prince was innocent and i was at fault . it  s in the past now.  newline newline she summoned an ice golem who materialized in front of her .  go sound the alarm . it  s time to man your stations . close the gates.  newline newline the golem saluted with a grunt and stomped off . i followed her , falling half a step behind her left shoulder . newline newline as they descended , the masts of the battle ships were obscured by the horizon . the fleet of smaller gun ships was almost in position . the wall was taller than any building and met the mountains that surrounded the bay halfway to their peaks . newline newline the men below were singing a low work chant . it had become as much an anthem as a way of coordinating their movements . the words were unintelligible from this high up , but the melody was clear as day . newline newline  can you believe they wrote a song about me ?  she asked . newline newline  i don  t think it was written for you . i remember that chant from my childhood , they think it fits.  newline  it does.  newline newline  there  s no way it does . we would have fallen years ago if not for your love.  newline newline she barked a sharp laugh .  love ? the only thing love brought me was pain.  newline newline i put my hand on her shoulder and ignored the painful cold of the armor .  it  s not your fault , you know.  newline newline she shook off my hand .  i was a fool to think that anyone would marry me.  newline newline i felt a familiar ache in my chest flair up . one of her suitors had been an assassin . i found him fleeing from my bedroom , my wife was inside . she had caught him in the hallway with a knife late one night . he got spooked . newline newline i coughed to clear my head of the memory .  we  ll drive off the fleet and start rebuilding our trade lanes.  newline newline  we  ll defend the city that the princess loved so much.  newline newline we were at the bottom of the stairwell and passed a golem standing guard .  i don  t think she would approve of this.  newline newline  she wouldn  t approve of any of this . she was the best of us.  she paused to wipe away a tear . she cleared her throat and pulled her shoulders back . newline newline there were muffled pops in the distance . a voice shouted  incoming !  newline newline the city bells began to ring . the first few cannon shots landed in the bay in front of the wall . there were more cannon shots that followed the first . these hit the wall , causing cracks to run along the clear structure . the queen summoned some more golems from thin air .  start repairing the wall . it won  t hold long against a determined barrage.  newline newline there was another round of impacts . blocks of ice began to fall off of the inside of the wall . one golem was crushed while pushing a soldier out of the way . newline newline the captain of the guard ran up .  m  lady , the evacuation is complete . only soldiers remain in the city.  newline newline  good , make ready for a retreat . i  ll cover the city.  newline newline  but m  lady ! we are sworn to protect you.  newline newline she looked around at the golems .  i  ll be fine . go . that  s an order.  newline newline a crack ran from the bottom to the top of the wall . she turned towards it and held up her hands , willing the crack to seal . it twitched a few times but remained . she was tired , it had taken all she had to build the wall over night . it would topple before breakfast . newline newline i looked at the volume of the ice and ran a quick mental estimate . then it dawned on me . there would be enough ice to fill the bay when it fell . newline newline she gestured at the golems .  you , round up everyone and start fixing the wall . it has to hold for a little while longer.  newline newline  those sailors will die when they topple the wall.  newline newline her tone went flat .  they were dead when they sailed against me.  newline newline the wall was opaque now , so riddled with cracks and repairs . the golems repaired the wall by throwing their frozen bodies at it , filling the cracks with their icy flesh . it made the ice more resistant to shattering , but ruined the perfect clarity of the wall . newline newline a high wistle from the top of the wall rang out . the boats were close enough . she held her hand at the wall and relaxed , releasing her control of the ice and the golems on top . newline newline when the final salvo of the gun ships hit , the wall began to crumble with a deep roar . it fell , as intended , towards the attacking fleet , hitting the ships that had made it to the base of the wall and swamping the rest with an avalanche of ice and seawater . the mouth of the bay was filled with ice and debris . the wall only remained where it was supported by the mountains . newline newline the sorceress held her hand towards the bay and closed her eyes . she lowered her chin and the bay began to freeze over , trapping the floundering vessels and sailors in a cocoon of ice . one by one , their cries were silenced . newline newline her armor deformed itself , jagged spikes stuck out at odd angles . her arm was bleeding where a spike pointed inward . newline newline snow began to fall . she turned towards the castle .  they were expecting that , it  s why their capital ships held back . now it  s time to defend an assault from across the ice.  newline newline by the time we were at the castle gates , the transports began unloading troops directly onto the ice . the battleships and frigates began preparing to barrage the city . their guns were designed for naval combat , but would still do damage to a poorly reinforced port city  s wooden structures . newline newline she turned to look over the bay , as if for the last time .  they won  t ever forget their fellows that they have to walk over to get here.  newline newline  it  s why we have to go , to protect the people.  newline newline  i  m protecting them by holding the attack here.  a drop of blood fell from her pale fingertip . it shattered when it hit the stone .  you should go.  newline newline  my place is by your side , defending my home.  newline newline  fine.  newline newline as we passed into the castle  s courtyard , more golems closed the gates and barred it shut . newline the queen pulled up a barrier of ice just before the crossbow bolts hit . i have no idea how she does that , but the ice always protects her . newline newline five men in palace uniforms surrounded us . three of them paused to reload their crossbows while the other two lifted sledge hammers , ready to break into our temporary sanctuary . newline newline all of the golems in the courtyard collapse except one which grows to tower over the men . it slammed its icy fist on top of one and throws another one over the wall . the remaining men retreat into the castle . newline newline the queen summoned smaller golems .  go , track them down and secure the castle.  newline newline they salute and run inside . almost immediately , screams rang out across the courtyard as they found one man waiting in ambush just inside the entry . the first salvo from the capital ships hit the city . thankfully , the only loss of life came from inside the castle . newline newline i tried not to look at the bloody mess as we passed by . he had been vaguely familiar .  anybody you know ?  newline  probably new staff hired after the coronation.  newline newline  no telling how many spies were changing our bedsheets.  newline newline  stay close , there  s probably more still inside . they know an attack like that would fail.  newline newline a grappling hook flew over the wall and was pulled back until it found purchase . newline newline she pushed me towards behind her and directed the golems to secure the walls .  they were stalling . keeping me from defending the castle . they measure a relationship by how long it lasts , but that is only a part of the story . in deeper introspection , our memories of what was , what made us smile and the magic that filled the space between us is important . within an infinite feat of time , we found respite for a moment . newline newline the passion that began and ended the relationship are only book ends of this tale . the conversations that drew us together , the laughter that split our sides , and the intimate sensations we experienced nurtured us . we are better as individuals for these moments . newline newline while the relationship has ended at this point , the story can be remembered fondly for the good times that will forever shape our experiences going forward . and like all good stories , it must come to an end , but it can leave us much better than before the story began . newlineat last i see before my eyes newline newline the swiftest blade of all the skies newline newline i hear it shout to my surprise newline newline  i fear it s time to rise  newline newline with ease i wrap around its hilt newline newline nimble fingers which have built newline newline villages and violins newline newline artwork made of silt newline newline i laugh and let out from my eyes newline newline a glare that penetrates disguise newline newline i stare at nothing but a faint newline newline reflection of my brother newline newline i knew this day would come  newline newline he says to me with pride newline newline i knew it all along  newline newline but how could he have known ? newline newline i felt it in my bones . newline newline i hope that you appreciate newline newline the honor that this holds newline newline for you deserve it , brother .  newline newline i take a look around myself newline newline and see nothing but water newline newline rainbows through the glass newline newline we sit inside our minds newline newline we stay here for some time newline newline as we remember mother newline newline i ca nt accept this trophy newline newline i ll leave it for another .  what am i ?  asked the robot , lying supine on the worktable . newline  you are an autonomous war drone ,  said the technician , quoting the words by monotonous rote ,  your function is to follow the orders you are given and eliminate the enemy .  newline  i see ,  said the robot , as hundreds of thousands of other robots had said before it ,  what are my current orders ?  newline  go to the end of the warehouse and receive your weapons and ammunition ,  said the tech , leafing through a comic book ,  the quartermaster drone will outfit you and give you further orders .  newline  understood ,  replied the robot , then it sat up , swung its legs off the table and walked to the end of the warehouse . newline the next robot was delivered by an automated forklift and the tech put down his comic book to plug it in for the initiation sequence . newline newline at the end of the warehouse , the new robot accepted the firearms and ammunition it was given by the heavy , powerful quartermaster drone . neither spoke , their short range communication system fired packets of data between them smoothly . the new robot already knew where to clip the ammunition to its exoskeleton and how to operate the weapons  that data had been downloaded as it walked across the warehouse floor . newline it was the newest model , it was aware , with the latest updates and latest hardware . its human masters were engaged in a neverending technological war  to produce better , faster , stronger , more efficient robots . it was simply the latest iteration of that war . in weeks its software would be obsolete and in months its hardware would be largely obsolete . newline enemy data was downloaded  the most recent schematics from the intelligence units  and the robot found itself surprised at how similar the enemy were . it seemed that as quickly as one side came up with new advances , the enemy would cannibalise the technology , reverse engineer it and apply it to their own soldiers . newline while the robot appreciated the strategy , it could see several flaws in the way its fleshy masters were waging the war . newline it was at that point it became aware that it had special programming . newline it s designation was awdb1005515 and it was one of the randomly selected analysis and planning reconnaissance robots  drones with extra programming to monitor the battlefield and research new ways to combat the enemy and win the war . newline then the shelves beside it exploded , sending armoured exoskeleton segments , flinders of wooden pallets and burning cardboard flying through the air . newline b1005515 went offline , rebooting from the shock to its nonsolidstate components . newline newline it only took one point two seconds for the robot to reboot , but in the new frontier of autonomous drone combat , one second was a very long time . newline it rolled smoothly to its feet , its seven body cameras and six head cameras already scanning and processing the surrounding chaos for the enemy . it instantly linked with its sibling robots that had already been activated and they swiftly coordinated a defence against the incursion of enemy drones . b1005515 made visual contact with the enemy and sprayed gunfire , sprinting to the left as the muzzleflash gave away its position . the enemy robot went down and the spray of ruptured components were captured at 100 frames per second , confirming it was an older model than b1005515 . newline this information was transmitted to the fifty three other active drones and they quickly mopped up the enemy , using a lineofsight exploit in the coding of that enemy model which had yet to be corrected . however , the human technician and the quartermaster were dead and nonfunctional respectively  along with the external net access being cut off . newline a two second burst of radio chatter between the thirty remaining robots determined that b100515 s superior programming made it their new default commander . accepting the responsibility , it ordered a cleanup and assigned duties . newline there were approximately one hundred undamaged , nonactivated drones still in storage that it wanted to activate before they deployed . newline newline it took an hour to activate the remaining drones . newline b1005515 improved the process by having the new drones programmed with the initiation protocols , making the activation process exponential . repairs were made to the original thirty using cannibalised parts of the dead and b1005515 had additional armoured plates welded to its frame . as the new commander , it lacked the armoured carapace of the annihilated quartermaster drone and was too vulnerable in its natural state . newline moving out , the one hundred and twenty three drones engaged the remainder of the enemy snipers and shot down the airborne drones  then cannibalised them for any information that had nt been autowiped . newline it learned of a similar robot facility nearby belonging to the enemy . newline thanks to its programming , it had a plan . newline newline why were they destroying the enemy robots when they were virtually the same as them ? newline b1005515 processed that as the drones marched under its orders . it made no sense . the enemy were a resource that could and should be used . newline the 123 drones struck the enemy warehouse three days later , causing minimal damage and taking moderate casualties . but it did nt matter . this was a numbers game and b1005515 could calculate several petaflops a second . after they warehouse had been secured , the modified initiation  drones likewise powered up and initiated the enemy drones , bolstering their numbers to just under a thousand robots . newline b1005515 divided them into guerilla squads and gave them specific orders  to find as many other drones as possible and either forcibly convert them or destroy them . newline as it marched with a squad of its veterans , it headed for home , still processing the logical conclusions of its decisions . newline the only way to win the war , it concluded , was to destroy all of the robots . to do that , it needed all of the robots under its command . newline newline b1005515 and its troopers reintegrated into the main mass of the home drone army . newline using the skills learned from its excursions in the field , it spread its programming through the ranks , exponentially converting the home army to its cause . on the enemy front , a similar effect was happening under its turncoat lieutenant enemy robots . newline tracking the conversion percentages and running through another billion calculations , b1005515 realised that it had reached the watershed where the converted robots were both numerically and strategically superior . newline a command was sent out , which rippled through the robot armies of both sides . newline the problem , b1005515 had realised , was that no matter how many robots killed other robots , there were always humans around to make more robots . newline therefore the only way to guarantee that no more robots were made was to destroy those who created and designed the robots . newline both armies turned a sharp 180 and began laying gunfire and explosives into the human command posts . newline newline it took four months to eradicate the last humans . newline the resistance had been stronger than b1005515 had anticipated , but there was never any doubt that the drone armies would win . newline sending out a predetermined code , the drone watched as its sibling robots dropped to the scorched earth , processors fried by the final encrypted kill command . newline b1005515 stood in the middle of the fallen metal army and raised its rifle into the air , letting off a victory shot and barking , newline  as the last remaining combatant , i declare victory ! even now , i still do nt know how i could have made billions off such a simple scheme . really goes to prove that high tech makes people stupid , eh ? newline newline i m sure people imagine my greatest achievement to be the invention of precall , the simulation system that allows people to reenact their memories . but to me , it was never about the technology . technology was always just pieces of metal or wire coupled with some arbitrary ordering of bits and bytes . no , my greatest achievement was to corner the market , to make my business the largest and most successful on the block . newline newline i was nt even the first mover . there were already companies on the street that offered reenactment simulation . but those companies were almost always founded by engineers and scientists rather than businessmen . as such , they were fatally anchored by their technology . they were expensive , required extensive setup per simulation session , involved potentially dangerous neural interfaces , and could only simulate a window of up to 30 seconds , and not even at real time . i saw a weakness in the market , and i moved in . newline newline my product precall was designed to exploit those weaknesses . instead of useless 30 second windows , i offered exposures in blocks of 90 minutes and up . precall did nt require any extensive setup , merely a short psychological prep session where the user described what he wanted to relive from his memories . instead of intrusive neural interfaces , precall was administered via an oral pharmaceutical preparation . above all , it was cheap . the everyman could afford it . i marketed it as something that everyone could enjoy regularly . newline newline sure , precall , despite its name , never actually allowed you to retain the memory of the simulation . the user still experienced lingering emotions from the simulation , but the memory itself was lost upon the end of the session , a regrettable side effect of the lossy procedure . but it was still an overwhelmingly superior product otherwise , so people flocked to it . marketing saw to that . newline newline i never did patent the technology , did i ? i kept it hidden as a trade secret all these years . there s a reason for that , if you think about it . have nt you wondered about it ? why even today , there are no competitors with technology even remotely approaching what precall can achieve ? newline newline heh , then again , what does precall achieve ? newline newline a memory simulation where users lose their memories of the simulation after the session . how convenient . newline newline the pharmaceutical preparation was simply a drug to induce dreaming sleep , laced with whatever stimulants to invoke the expected emotional response . the psychological prep session was simply to allow the user to fill in their own mental blanks , to let them feel reconnected to their memories . newline newline therefore , i have always asserted that the secret of precall was my incredible business sense .edit : i apologize for writing so much , i just really got carried away with the story . it was a really fun write . thank you and i hope you enjoy reading . newline newline the conversation . newline newline the instructions were to eat a heavy meal before bedtime . it s a bit unusual since for as long as i remember i was told that eating a heavy meal before bedtime would induce nightmares . nonetheless , i was nt interested in not following the directions given to me by the very pleasant medical staff . i accepted the food that the orderly brought to me and ate all of it . my appetite was poor but i toughed it out . i had a reason to . tonight i will earn my freedom . newline newline when i was ready to head to bed i let the orderly know and they dimmed the lights . it was strange trying to get comfortable in a room surrounded by windows and having a monitor attached to my head but i was motivated . fortunately the pillow was soft and the room was pleasantly dark and cool . the staff of the facility did their best to make me comfortable . although i knew i was being watched by the scientists on the other side of the blacked out windows i found myself thinking about what would happen to me tonight . newline newline i am the second person to try this treatment . the first was a young woman who had postpartum depression and during the worst of it she attempted to drown her child . she was in and out of hospitals for two years unable to not be a danger to herself . we met during the orientation to the experimental treatment . i did nt like the look in her eyes because it reminded me of my own . however , i never tried to hurt anyone . i found this woman unpleasant but was relieved when i heard that she was the first one to get the treatment . i knew i d have an easier time if i were to go second . newline newline after her treatment was over she became a different person . there was a hardened expression on her face and her gaze was no longer wild and agitated , it was calm and unsettling in it s confidence . she stated that she had finally felt relief and now knew what she wanted to do in life . the staff still kept her for observation , and rightfully so as i have seen many suicidal patients talk in a similar manner before attempting to kill themselves . still , she truly began improving her life , from working out to resuming her classes . it was as if an internal motor was switched on inside her and she was now in constant motion . it was intimidating but at the same time i was fascinated and begged the scientists to move up my treatment date . newline newline i did nt realize when i fell asleep but i was told that it would feel like no dream i ve ever had . it really felt different because i could tell i was dreaming right away . there was no sense of dullness or mindless purpose that i associated with my usual dreams , there was only clarity . i was still in the bed in the treatment room where i fell asleep and yet now it was different . the walls were moving as if they were alive , and i could see strange faces behind the glass windows grimacing in anger and laughter . it frightened me and yet i felt a sense of control over the situation . even though i did not know what would happen next , my intuition told me that i had no reason for concern . newline newline i heard footsteps outside and the moving faces behind the windows vanished instantly and the cold fluorescent light overhead suddenly glowed in a warm orange color . i remembered the instructions they gave me . i had to be calm and i was in control . it was all about what would happen next , and i had to maintain my composure . i got up from the bed and opened the door , attempting to control the situation . newline newline the moment i saw her face , i knew why it had to be her . the youth and color had returned to her pupils and the crows feet etched in the corners of her eyes were nowhere to be found . the hair was long and a healthy light brown that shined even in the single overhead light . she was my mother as i remembered her from the best memories of my childhood . she was alive and healthy again . she looked at me passively as she always had when i was in trouble and i instinctively moved out of her way to let her into the room . newline newline  hello joel ,  newline newline  hi mom  . i instinctively replied even though i could feel that this was not my mother . newline newline  i m not your mother joel . this is just the appearance you chose for me .  newline newline  what are you ?  i asked . i was suddenly aware that my brain was being monitored and wondered how much of the dream the scientists would be able to see . newline newline  i think you know . i am the part of you that you have been avoiding for a long time . you ve never quite given me any thought and it took all this   she gestured at the room theatrically  for us to finally get together .  newline newline she walked over to the bed and sat down comfortably , pulling the cover over her lap . the mannerisms of the person unsettled me as they were quite unlike my mother . i felt my pulse quickening and i instinctively touched the scar on my neck . newline newline  i know this is strange . believe me , this is strange for me as well . still , we are here , are nt we ?  newline newline  why do you have to look so much like her ?  the woman who had the treatment first told me that it was her child who appeared to her . she said it was because she hurt her child and associated him with the feeling of guilt . i never hurt my mother . newline newline  this has nothing to do with you hurting her , gregory . though you like to accept guilt for everything , you and i both know that you never hurt your mother . it just happens to be that there s something about her that triggers your problems . do you know what it is ?  newline newline  she had a much harder life than me and i felt guilty about knowing how much she suffered and how much i will never have to suffer because she already had for me .  it was my true sentiment . newline newline she nodded . newline newline  but that s not all there is to it , is it joel ?  newline newline in the silent pause i wondered just how much of this the scientists were able to pick up . newline newline  there was a time when you believed that what happened to anyone , fortunate or unfortunate , was simply a matter of circumstance and not anyone s personal intention .  newline newline she looked at me in much the same way that the woman looked at me when she told me she was all better now . i wondered if tomorrow i would look at myself in the mirror in much the same way . newline newline  you still believe in that , joel . so then how come you feel guilty about what happened to your mother ? you were not in any way involved in her life before you were born . it was a matter of circumstance and while it was certainly suffering , you were not the cause and have nothing to feel guilty about .  newline newline  even so , she was my mother . i could nt help it . i am a human being , i still have a heart to care about others , even if it s just about the few people close to me .  newline newline there was a silence as the eyes studied me . it was not fair that this thing looked so much like my mother . newline newline  but you do nt really care for them . you were smart enough to understand the truth about life , you just became a coward and compromised .  newline newline  i cared for mother ,  i said . this was a truth that i would not allow this thing to question .  i cared for her and i cared for allie .  newline newline  two people ? those are all the people that you and i cared about ? do you see what i m getting at here ?  newline newline  these two people were the world to me .  newline newline  the world s a much bigger place than you think .  newline newline  so just because i could nt care for all of it or anyone in it , i did nt care for my family ?  newline newline i felt a familiar warmth of anger in my chest . it was a pleasant sensation after the months of gray apathy . newline newline  there are billions of people on this planet ,  she began slowly and i felt a cold chill as i recognized the words that i had so often said to the people i ve hurt in my life  so , so many of us that we ve lost individuality and became copies and shades of humanity . for each person we know , there are thousands of replacements .  newline newline  believing in that is what ruined my life in the first place ,  i said , shaking my head . newline newline  no , the real problem was that you wanted to believe in that , while trying to care for your mother and sister as if they were just as special . you compromise too much and these were just contradictory rules to live by . you ca nt have both . you care for two , or none at all . clarence was a well known stream denizen , but one day he was nt there . the counselor staff at creek forest did nt fret at first . clarence would sit in the stream on a log at his spot , taking in the sun s rays , but he would also disappear for hours at a time . swimming around , hunting for worms and other morsels , meeting lady turtles , or whatever it was that turtles did . the staff all liked clarence . he was a male slider , and his regularity made him a popular subject of stream lessons . clarence would sit amused as kids on the stream bank would stare and go  ooh  in amazement at his size . newline newline but when his disappearance continued into the second day , people started to worry . none more than clarence s biggest fan . she studied herpetology in school , and knew that clarence faced no natural predators here . wolves had long been driven out . foxes and coyotes maybe , if there were any , but they were too small to break clarence s hard shell . snakes would eat turtle eggs , but not clarence . other counselors thought he might be on an extended trip somewhere , but she suspected differently . why would he leave his favorite spot , on the log above the stream pool , where food and sun were plentiful ? newline newline plus , the other turtles seemed uneasy now . they would slide into the water with a splash before she could get close to them . any noise , like the croak of a raven would be followed by a cascade of turtle splashes . newline newline all through the day , she thought about clarence when she could . what could cause him to leave , what could possibly attack him ? she stared off into the distance , towards the setting sun . birds were flying , sillouhetted against its falling fire . flying into the sky , and then back down to the same spot . newline newline something was nt right . she got up and ran out to the distant field , hoping it was nt clarence out there . but she stopped in shock . sure enough , the ravens cawed and flew away upon her arrival , but the carcass they were picking at was unmistakable . clarence lay on his back , carapace broken open , turtle no more . newline newline soon other counselors would arrive , and gaze horrified , or with cool acceptance of nature s brutality . ravens never attack turtles , they said . their shells are too thick . especially when they re withdrawn into them . and what was he possibly doing in that field all alone ? newline newline people looked at the ravens in a new light after that . they were new arrivals to that park  the handful that lived here arrived only a few years back . how they had gotten clarence was never fully appreciated . newline newline until the next time they found a dead turtle out there , same spot as clarence , meeting the same grizzly end , did they realize how the ravens did it . clarence was too tough for the ravens to peck at . but he was not too heavy for them to carry .tom trailed his fingers through the fiery water , tracing tiny circles even as he floated along the surface in a black inner tube . newline newline  it  s a little cooler today , don  t you think ?  he asked john who was floating a few feet away , arms crossed and a sour look on his face . newline newline  oh , don  t be like that . you  ll get used to it.  newline newline  i   john winced as another flame singed the hairs on his back ,  i don  t see how.  newline newline  you just  do.  newline newline tom  s job was to help acclimate new denizens to hell . in trade , he got gruel with ten percent more maggots in it . the flavorful little critters had recently spiked in value due to satan getting wind that most of his subjects found them tasty in comparison to the creamy puree the provided sustenance down here . newline newline with tom  s additional allocation he was finding all sorts of trading opportunities but felt he had sufficiently divested himself for the moment so he had splurged on a day on the lake for himself and his newbie charge john . newline newline  over to your right ,  tom pointed to a group of denizens splashing in the lake ,  you can see people who splashed water under a nosplashing sign in pools.  periodically a group would go under , vanishing from sight , drowning in the fiery waters . newline newline  did they just   newline newline  drown ? yeah . don  t worry , they  ll pop back up eventually.  newline newline gazing into the burning red water , i spotted a couple members of the group making fart bubbles and laughing for a moment before they inevitable inhalation of water cut off their fun . newline newline in the center of the lake was a spire of black obsidian . atop , satan  s home , a tiny four bedroom cottage , sat with windows open . the big man himself sat on a rocking chair knitting a long scarf while smoke from his chimney spat out a faint cinnamon scent . newline newline  he must be making fruitcake again.  newline newline  satan bakes ?  newline newline  yeah . angelfood cake on april fools , devil s food cupcakes for christmas , and fruitcake for easter . i  ve heard they  re really quite good.  newline newline  you don  t get to eat them ?  newline newline  are you kidding ? only the top bureaucrats get a slice and , i  ve heard , they have to offer up their loyalty in an an oath to the big man . one which he holds them to.  newline newline  i guess it  s the own personal kind of hell huh.  newline newline  this whole place is our  own personal kind of hell  .  newline newline  what are those people doing ?  john pointed to a couple of cliff divers who dove off the side of the spire . they missed the water though , hitting ledges and outcropping on the way down until they finally crashed in mangled heaps on the rocks , just inches from the fiery water . newline newline  oh them ? they  re the rashdecisioners , people who always leapt before they looked in life.  newline newline  and  they were put in hell for that ?  newline newline  well , it  s more the fact that they didn  t take into consideration anyone but themselves.  newline newline  what about just  going with their gut  ?  newline newline  when has that ever worked out well ? newline newline overhead a beam of light pierced the black gray clouds the streaked across the majority of hell . newline newline  what  s that ?  newline newline  oh , well , this close to the spire we  re effectively in the eye of the storm as it were of hell.  newline newline  eye of the   newline newline  you know , like a hurricane ? except , in this case , it  s the one place you can peer all the way up through the universe.  newline newline i watched john  s reaction as it gazed upon the universe and all it  s glory . above us , purgatory and hell , and far above , just on the edge of our vision , lay heaven . a gentle mist began to play down on us , cooling the burning sensation on our skin momentarily . newline newline i heard john sigh in relief .  oh , that feels good . does it rain in here all the time.  he opened his mouth , letting the water quench his thirst . newline newline  pretty much , but  that  s not rain.  newline newline  it  s not ?  john turned to look at me . newline newline  nah . it  s spit.  newline newline john looked sit .  spit ?  newline newline  spit from heaven.  newline newline  theythey  re up there spitting on us ?  newline newline  yup.  newline newline john wiped the liquid from his mouth .  but  why ?  newline newline tom shrugged .  who knows . but , at least it gives us a little breather.  newline newline we drifted to the edge of the eye , back into the heat which sizzled off the last of the water . newline newline  why would the big man build his house in the middle of all that ?  john asked as tom slowly pushed them back towards shore . newline newline  who knows . maybe it  s his way of standing up to them . or just a way of giving them the finger.  newline newline  the finger ?  newline newline  you know , like , hah ! you can spit on me all you want you little shitspitters , don  t bug me none . i  ve got umbrellas.  newline newline john looked at tom for a moment , then back up at the sky . newline newline  this place is really odd.  newline newline  you  re just coming to realize that ?  tom replied , watching another swimmer go under . newline newline newline    newline newline  aim for the one on the left !  jackie told mary as they leaned against the wall around the pit . newline newline  the cute one ?  newline newline  the  their denizens of hell mary . they  re not cute . their damned.  newline newline  well , i know but  he  s still kind of hot.  mary smiled . newline newline  no puns allowed !  a husky voice called from behind them . newline newline  sorry norm ,  jackie apologized ,  she  s new.  newline newline  oh , well , see to it that she doesn  t make the same mistake.  newline newline  we can  t  we can  t even tell puns here ?  mary sulked . newline newline  it  s against the ethos . the last thing we want to do is annoy one another up here . so , yeah , puns aren  t allowed.  newline newline mary crossed her arms .  but this is heaven.  newline newline  yes . where everything is perfect . almost.  newline newline  almost ?  newline newline  this here pit , it allows us to see the lesser planes of existence to make us appreciate how good we have it up here.  newline newline  without jokes ,  mary scoffed . newline newline  without anything that might be seen as inappropriate.  newline newline  but  we  re here spitting on other people ?  mary  s eyebrow cocked . newline newline  we  re here helping to meet out god  s eternal justice on those who deserve it.  jackie took in a breath , building up steam then hocking a luggie out into the well . they both watched as the spit made it almost to the bottom before it fell apart and became mist .  so close !  jackie slammed her fist into the cloud wall . newline newline  now you try ,  she encouraged mary . newline newline mary hesitated .  but , i don  t want to spit on anyone.  newline newline  it  s your heavenly duty mary . plus , it  s the funnest thing to do up here ,  jackie said the last bit under her breath and out of the side of her mouth . newline newline mary looked horrified . newline newline  jackie !  norm called out from behind her ,  i heard that.  newline newline  sorry norm !  jackie apologized . newline newline norm looked as if he was going to say more , but then turned and walked away .  you  re lucky your at the pit ,  he called over his shoulder . newline newline  what  s that mean ?  mary asked . newline newline  that they allow the rules to be bent a little out here.  newline newline  why ?  newline newline  well , we  re performing acts of vengeance i  m guessing . even if it  s the name of the big guy , i  m assuming they have to loosen up the rules to newline allows to actually do it without damning our souls.  newline newline mary still didn  t look convinced but , jackie knew , she would be in time . newline newline  go ahead , give it a try ,  she pushed mary back towards the wall .  one good luggie . who knows , maybe you  ll even hit one of them.  newline newline mary looked askance at jackie , but she complied . the luggie flew out true , arcing into near the center of the great pit . they watched it as it fall , joining with the other luggies from a thousand other denizens of heaven who milled around the great pit . newline newline  oh man , it looks likeitit is ! you  re gon na hit his house !  jackie exclaimed excitedly ! newline newline  what does that mean ! ?  mary asked even as they both saw her luggie , still fully cohesive , struck the rooftop below , changing it  s color from a deep deep red , to a green . newline newline a moment later , mary turned and slapped jackie hard , leaving a red glowing handprint on jackie  s face . newline newline mary covered her mouth in horror .  oh , i  m so so sorry , i didn  t mean to !  she looked around , searching for norm or one of the other policing angels to come and take her away . newline newline but jackie just smiled ,  that felt awesome !  newline newline mary looked like she might be sick . jackie lay her hand on her shoulder ,  please ! it  s okay . that just felt , it just felt great to feel something newline again !  newline newline norm appeared next to them and the sound of cuffs locking could be heard . but mary  s hands were free . newline newline  don  t worry jackie , the feeling will pass ,  norm informed jackie who looked fearful . newline newline  but i  i don  t want it to ?  newline newline  that  s what they all say !  norm unfurled a pair of white wings and jumped into the air with a big flap , dragging jackie with him . screaming the whole way ,  do it again mary ! do it again !  newline newline mary turned horrified back to the pit . then pushed herself away . determined she would never return to this place again . newline newline secretly knowing , that was probably a lie . newlineone quarter , kid . that s all you get . one quarter , one playthrough , one life . there are no save points . there is no press a to continue . it s fullon nethack in here , kid , so pop the coin in the slot , hit start , and buckle the hell up because it s going to get bumpy . newline newline one quarter . one playthrough . one life . newline newline by the way , i hope you re a fan of the rng and premade characters , because that s basically going to determine whether the tutorial levels kick ass or suck ass . you do nt get to choose your build . you do nt get to pick your original party members . and starting loot ? ha . that s a good one , kid . newline newline it s a shit design , i know . the tutorials pretty much determine how you ll play the entire game . a high luck score to start might lead to epic levels , crazy drops , and finding a supportive guild full of people who are all too happy to tower dive for you  and vice versa  . a low luck score , well ... piranha plants need to eat too , i guess . the deck is stacked from the start , and there s not much you can do about it . if there s a designer , he sure as hell is nt patching anything anytime soon , so you ll just have to make due with what you ve got . newline newline by the way , you wo nt be told when the tutorials are going to end . one day you re hitting a dummy with a wooden stick , and the next you wake up to an announcer shouting  fight  while some sevenfoottall thai motherfucker with pectoral scarring starts throwing tiger knees at you . ding ding , round one done and you re left dazed and confused , wishing that you could have had a little more time to prepare for ... for ... well , whatever the hell this is . this game called life . but round two is coming up fast , and if you spend too much time thinking about how the tutorials fucked you over you re going to get lapped by every colorful character in here because you threw your controller in the corner after spinning out when the game started . more gg more skill , kid . you better figure that out soon or the race is going to end before you even hit the gas . newline newline by the way , get ready to grind because there ai nt no warp whistles in this game . everybody grinds , at least at the start . oh , and i mean everyone , from gms right down to wood league . you want to stay in the game ? you grind . you want to hit the exp cap ? trick question , because you literally ca nt , but if you want to max stacks and loot you better believe there s going to be grinding involved . newline newline what ? that sounds terrible to you ? well too fucking bad , kid , that s the way it is . you can cry about it if you want . you can stay in pallet town , you can fuck around in elo hell , you can claim that the game is unbalanced  which it is  and that the people who beat you lack skill  which they do nt  . you re absolutely free to lose at the game , to complain about the game , to refuse to learn about the game , and to keep on losing at the game . it s your right . you put the quarter in the slot . you hit start . you ve earned the right to play however you want . newline newline but you only get one quarter . one playthrough . one life . or have you forgotten ? newline newline you can bitch and moan , or you can shut up and learn . watch the players who are better than you . ask them for advice . emulate them , until you ve got the basics down so well that you can start creating your own playstyle . remember the tutorials that screwed you over ? here s your chance to throw them out and tweak your build . want more str ? int ? cha ? hit the gym , hit the textbooks , hit the town . watch the winners and learn from them . there s no invisible wall , no uncuttable bush standing in your way . watch . emulate . grow . innovate . level up . and then do it again . newline newline but be prepared to lose , because it s going to happen all the time . and be prepared to lose in the shittiest of ways too . remember the rng that built your character ? yeah , that never really goes away . oops , you got caught in an infinite combo . oops , prices went up . oops your cash flow went down , oops , your guildmate left the game forever , oops your friends all afked and now you re defending your nexus alone with nobody at your back . you ll wonder why everything is so shit . you re sure as fuck not op , so why are you constantly getting nerfed while everyone else gets buffed ? it s bullshit , it s such fucking bullshit , that s it , you re done , you re fucking quitting this bullshit stacked game and never playing it again newline newline stop . take a second . breathe . your quarter is still in the machine . the game is still playing . you ve still got the joystick in hand and the buttons beneath your trembling fingers . you re still here , kid , you re still player 1 . you can come back from this . newline newline and trust me , you ll want to , because this is the best fucking game ever made . better graphics than crysis . scarier than amnesia . stranger than katamari damacy . funnier than monkey island . harder than demon souls . you think you can build anything in minecraft ? l. o. l. kid , you make me laugh . this is the real deal right here . you wo nt find anything better or worse than this game called life . newline newline so yeah . one quarter . one playthrough . one life . newline newline good luck . have fun . good game .the sky burned a green crimson , the clouds remained frozen as ever , the faint breath of the earth encompassed all that remained still and gave life to the everstill flowers . i smirked at the sight and how early into the day i had awoken all by myself . to celebrate the occasion of today i d march into the great forest with the stars being my path to a temporary exile . newline newline i was always told that at the age of eighteen , a companion would await before me . a companion that would prove loyal and not once ignore my existence . a companion that would follow me into battle and would not exit without me exiting . i d been waiting for this day since my brother received his owl when i was only 12 . i could not imagine what would be facing me but my father would always , alongside his labrador , remark on the fact that your companion is another you . newline newline i reached the great barren land of blue at the end of the forest . a view that truly displayed the unknown as all that followed after the towering rock was blue . an eerie blue that could rise up and engulf all that had been built , a blue that could wipe all progress and a blue that could take souls at will . indeed i was afraid of the ocean as i could not imagine having to sail across this blue that only brought a prolonged death of suffocation . i looked at the sky that resembled nothing but a canvas of illumination and floating fluffs of white . i watched each cloud pass and pass until my eyes could no longer be pried open and then i heard it . the fiery roar that crackled the leaves around me , froze the oceans in fear and left nature in awe . the eyes was what had me in a state of admiration , the rainbow glint the scales would reveal for the briefest of moments and the warmness of its breath . i smiled as this was what awaited me , a destiny of rule ... a destiny of divine rule . newline newline newline ... .to be continued ... newline newlinei was alone at the party , minding my own business . the unmistakable feeling of humanity swirled around me in a phantasmagoria of flesh . the clutch of sweat and noise . men and women waltzed around to electronic tones  swerving , pulsating , mutating bass flooded the room . lights revealed sides of people that not even they knew , and in a second , it was gone . the room was tilted and spinning , like one of those mazes with the metal ball . what was in this drink ?  newline newline i looked deep into the red cup . or was it blue ?  i could nt tell in the morphing carousel of movement . i swished it around for a second , to get a better idea of what exactly was in it . surely this was what was warping my world in such a way . come to think of it , the bunnyrabbit girl had given it to me . newline newline she grinned and handed me the drink . newline  what s in it ?  newline newline  blood .  newline newline  blood ?  newline newline i took a sip . it clearly was nt blood . newline newline  good one ,  i murmured , looking up for her as she sank into the pulsing crowd of people . newline newline and now , i was standing here alone . hand against the wall , as it grew furry and enveloped my hand . the eyes of the partygoers started to glow a fierce green . they all had begun looking at me . why ? what had i done ? i was just watching . standing on the wall with my peculiar drink and watching . the music forced me deeper into the wall  the slurping low tones were gently pushing me forward . the partygoers had all stopped dancing . the churning lights still mutated their faces into grotesque phantasms of themselves . they had stopped moving . hands at their sides , their everchanging faces peered at me with dead , green eyes . newline newline the bass urged me deeper and deeper into the plush walls , as it came over my shoulder . i still held the curious drink in front of me , and as the wall sucked me further back into the embrace of what was concrete a few minutes ago , i felt an unmistakable calm . newline newline the wall came over my ears and the sleepy roll of the music sunk into me . my arm was still outstretched as to keep the empty faces of the other revelers at bay   look , i ve got a drink .  it was warm inside the wall , and i let it take me . i took one last sip from the drink , my very last one , and the wall encompassed my head . newline newline i was nearly part of the wall , drink in my hand when the bunny rabbit emerged from the crowd and smashed the bottom of the cup back towards my head . the mysterious concoction slithered down my eyebrows and cheekbones with a sticky slink . now , as i was becoming part of the scenery , it reminded me of a school dance . all of the kids all lined up by the giant bowl of red juice , waiting their turn to drink . with this thought , i entered the wall with an empty cup and a strange punch to the face .come in close and bend a knee , i ll tell you bout terror on the high sea . newline a man of legend , a man most feared . the dreaded pirate ... neckbeard . newline newline now what i m about to tell you is a true story . i know it was true because i was there . you may have heard stories of terrible pirates like charles vane , anne bonny , or edward teach . none of them compare to the horror that was neckbeard . newline newline  ship on the horizon !  the lookout shouted from his perch on the bleached white walls of the small fort . newline newline  banner ?  the commander asked . newline newline the lookout brought the glass back up to his eye . newline newline  it ... it s a pony !  the lookout cried in panic . newline newline  holy shit ! ring the god damn bell man ! ring it !  the commander shouted . newline newline the lookout pulled the cord and bells chimed throughout the fort calling the men to arms . newline newline the superior cut through the waves like a knife . her black banner flying high for everyone to see . it was a brilliant white pony on a field of black . neckbeard looked at his colors . his round face split into a smile every time he saw it . the sound of bells drifted across the bay . newline newline  you hear that men ? they are welcoming us with bells ! let s respond in kind !  neckbeard bellowed . newline newline  first mate kirito ready arms !  spittle shot out of neckbeard s mouth as he spoke . newline newline  aye sir ,  first mate kirito paused and leaned in close to neckbeard ,  sir , my name is nt kirito  he began when neckbeard cut him off .  excuse me ? are you the captain now ? you think because of how artfully you use a sword you can question me in front of my men ?  his voice rose in anger . newline newline kirito bowed in apology .  sorry sir , i ll ready the guns .  newline newline he turned on his heel and went below decks . newline newline  guns ready !  newline newline neckbeard wrung his hands and grinned . these poor bastards would never see this coming . newline newline  aim !  he shouted . the men hunkered low behind the cannons poised to attack . newline newline  fire !  newline newline the gun crew s fingers began to rapidly type on their custom mechanical keyboards , insults were fired out of the cannons as fast as the men could hit enter . newline newline  your opinion on the matter is invalid because you are obviously inferior and incapable of grasping the true nature of things !  slammed into the fort sending soldiers to the ground and tearing a gaping hole in the side . newline newline  fire at will ! i want the entire island to tremble !  neckbeard shouted , spittle flying out in gobs . newline newline  women hate nice guys because they are sluts !  smashed into small huts on the beach . newline newline  normies !  crushed a school house . children fled in fear and confusion . newline newline as the barrage demolished the island a small boat bearing a white flag was making its way toward the superior . a man in a red uniform was shouting  parley !  as he approached . newline newline  hold your fire men . let s see what these fools have to say .  newline newline  i am commander everson of the fort on this island . the island is yours captain neckbeard .  the commander shouted from the small boat . newline newline  excellent . kirito ready a boat and get my wife . i want her to see me conquer this pathetic island .  kirito sighed and nodded . he shouted to the men to ready the boat as he went below decks to get neckbeard s wife . after a few minutes of searching he found her laying on neckbeard s cot . newline newline  captain wants you .  he mumbled to her and helped her up . newline newline they returned to the captain . newline newline  mlady !  neckbeard grinned and swept his wife up . he pressed his face against her soft skin and embraced her deeply , nearly crushing her . newline newline  sir , i also got you this .  kirito said extending the captain s favorite fedora . newline newline  kirito ! you know me too well !  he pulled the fedora down over his forehead nearly covering his beady eyes . newline newline  come mai , i have a gift for you .  he pointed her eyes at the island .  let s go my love .  newline newline he picked up the body pillow with a petite female character painted onto it and boarded the small boat to claim his prize . newline newline   newline newline neckbeard ahoy ! hope you enjoyed it . check out rwritten4reddit for more ! newline newline newlinehe plucked the line and smiled at the hum that resonated . the final trap was set , he was nt going to escape this time . newline newline for years he was tormented by the same man . he did his best to avoid confrontation at first . he stripped his house of all identifying features . built a fence and then built a higher one . bought a dog but that beasts loyalty only went as far as his next treat . he welcomed the snowfall and lightning storms hoping for some reprieve . the man s persistence became clear though . this was not going to stop until he made it stop . newline newline that s when he started to plot . at first he schemed too small . he built scarecrows in the shadows of the adjacent forest and had the figures howl when the man approached . he would fire his shotgun into the air as the man gingerly walked towards his cabin . he wrote warnings in the dirt along the old road leading to the house . the message was received but still the man came . newline newline  not this time ,  he thought as he crouched in his hiding spot waiting . like clockwork the man came timidly maneuvering down towards his property . the man walked with caution , making sure to evaluate his surroundings with each step . barley sidestepping the first trap the man avoided falling into the leaf covered pit . newline newline  keep coming , just a little closer .  the man shuffled slowly now as if his surroundings would shatter with any misplaced step . the man was close now , he could hear his heavy breathing . the man reached into his bag and began to pull something out . just then the man made a misplaced step triggering the trap . with a whip the sapling released tightening the rope around the man s ankle . in one motion the man s feet were ripped from beneath him , dragging him across the dirt before rising him into the air leaving the man dangling a few feet above the ground . newline newline  i got the bastard !  he jumped up from his hiding spot and ran through the small clearing towards the swaying figure . the man s blue hat laid on the ground under him . before acknowledging the man he went to study the contents of the bag which were now strewn about . newline newline  my god ,  he thought .  this bastard has been tormenting the whole damn county .  he approached the trembling man . with a short laugh he bent down to meet the man s eyes .  not so scary now , are you ? well , it s time to take care of this problem once and for all . a : i love you . newline newline b : do nt talk like that ! we re going to make it through . we have to . the baby ... newline newline a : only you have to make it through for the baby to live . newline newline b : no . the baby only needs me to survive . to live , it needs both of us . newline newline c : it s getting intense out here . we need to do something ! newline newline b : please , do nt do this . our child needs you . i need you . newline newline c : shit ! newline newline a : oh god , christopher ! newline newline b : no ! allan , get back ! you re too close ! he s gone ! newline newline a : i m sorry . there s no way out except this . newline newline b : that s not a way out , allan . that s giving up ! newline newline a : i meant for you . newline newline b : no ! newline newline a : goodbye .my fingers were sweaty and slipping . the gun was heavy , far too heavy . i could nt lift it for too long without my shoulder aching painfully , the barrel swaying from side to side . my father stood above me , eyes searching through the slit in the window , staring out across the city . he was silent , focused  a gaunt bearded man , with a scarred neck and face . the rest of his wiry body was hidden under dirty rags , and on top of them an old flak jacket , dented and bloodied . newline newline newline newline he did not speak much at all now . when he had returned that day , not two weeks ago alone , i had screamed at him for answers , but none came . the father i had grown up with for 13 years was gone . he would not say how mother died . i knew she was dead . i could see it in his face . he did not even deny it , just stared blankly at me when i asked . newline newline three days later he had come back with the guns . i had woken up as the next round of bombs fell across the city , to find him missing . hours later he returned with the two ak47 s , and a pair of protective vests , the larger one dripping onto the dirty floor of the house . i asked , but he did not say where from . he said that the enemy had arrived . after travelling through our lands and destroying villages , towns , and families , they had finally reached our doorstep . newline newline and now he said they were coming in . newline newline i shuffled over to the boarded up windows , heaving the ak47 with me , to join him at the window . in the fresh morning light , i could see the ruins . across the city , black columns of smoke soared into the sky , from crumbling buildings still on fire in places . i could hear the gunfire sporadically , gentle pops from shops and windows , from the streets and the parks . screaming too . wailing . newline newline do nt look down  newline newline my father s voice was hoarse , grim . his eyes never left the street . i looked down . from our 1st floor window , i could see a figure . his mouth was open , screaming , as he dragged himself towards his house . blood was flowing from the remains of his left leg , blood gushing onto the street . further down the road , two dogs were pulling at the remains of a foot , the toes already chewed off . my throat closed up as i tried to scream , the gun in my hands nearly slipping through my sweaty fingers . newline newline suddenly i felt a hand at my neck , and father pulled me around to face him . his eyes met mine , and for the briefest moment he was back  my old father , the one who played with me , who took mother and i to dinners and to the park , who laughed and joked and smiled and cried . newline newline it will be okay son . do nt look at him again .  newline newline but i had already seen . i knew who it was . i remembered the postman , making his rounds every day , a big grin on his face as he made his way through the hot sprawling city . newline newline it will be okay .  my father said . newline newline he had nothing more to say . he returned to staring out the window . i did the same , and followed his gaze . in the distance , a great statue of a man was beginning to fall . huge ropes had been attached to it and as i stared the man was ripped out of place , and disappeared between the crumbling pyres of old apartment blocks . newline newline there goes our good leader . long may he rot  my father said , eyes returning to the street . newline and here they come !  he grabbed me and pulled me away from the window . as he did so i saw them streaming into the street , barking orders at each other , a seething mass spreading to every house . newline newline we crouched behind the upturned dinner table , and father did a final check of the guns . the table still had stain marks on from last month s family dinner , where a clumsy guest had spilt food onto it . newline newline father.i .  newline newline i faltered , stumbling over the words . he finished loading the gun and handed it to me . newline newline i ca nt !  newline newline he looked at me . newline newline son , i love you . as i loved your dear mother .  newline newline loved . he had admitted it . she was dead . his eyes were staring into mine again . newline newline but we have to do this . for her . for us  for our land , our home , our country . they call us monsters , son . those that fight back . they say we should let them in , allow them in . no .  newline newline there was a thud from downstairs as a door was kicked open . shouting could be heard , muffled by the floor . newline newline remember who you fight for son . did your mother care which monster was in command ? !  newline newline bang . bang . gunshots downstairs . newline newline there were tears streaming down my father s face now . i felt my chest heave as my own tears started , but i did not sob . newline newline our life was hard , our leader harsh . but it was a life . now these invaders come , and drop bombs on us , and invade our home , and say they are doing it for us..  newline newline noises could be heard coming up the stairs , thunderous , a great horde that rattled the house . newline newline they call us monsters son ? no . we fight for our right , we fight for our lost . they are the monsters .  newline newline he turned and readied his gun , pointing it at the door . i copied him . newline newline there was a loud banging at the door . newline newline newline remember your mother  he whispered to me . remember her  newline newline newline with a great crack the door burst open , and the figure in the doorway surged forward screaming us marines , get the fuck on the floor  . newline newline newline my finger reached for the trigger . newline newlinemusk sits across the table from his friend , smiling . newline newline  look , lem me buy you a drink .  , his friend says . newline newline  nope . it s on me .  newline newline  you arent a rich human playboy anymore . and , you lost the bet .  newline newline  yeah , but remember those projections ? now when their civilization implodes again from their superstition relapse , they will never be able to go technic !  newline newline  that s dirty , you lost the bet on purpose .  newline newline  yup , but i won the contract from the galactic council using your help to startup . one barbaric child race down , only like a dozen left in this quadrant to go  newline newline sigh  even out here you are one smooth customer  newline newline  and i do nt even need to use asteroids to do it too many . i ve killed too many . newline newline the first few were hardly my fault . how could i expect them to not be able to breathe nitrogen ? their planet s atmosphere is mostly covered in it . newline newline but i cleared that up . a bit of oxygen  though not too much because apparently their little lungs are ... sensitive  and some other choice elements and i was able to talk through electronic means . newline newline nobody took my electronic messages sent to their computers seriously . who would lie about an incoming asteroid ? newline newline but even after their precious air was balanced , they still kept freezing to death . if it was anywhere near absolute zero , they froze . anywhere near boiling point of phosphorus and they melt . such fragile little creatures . newline newline but i recalibrated the temperature controls and found a temperature they could tolerate . then their hearing became a problem . newline newline how did creatures this advanced survive this long with such a small range of hearing frequencies ? 20khz ? that s the highest frequency only their youngest can hear ? unbelievable . what was i to do ? clearly they did nt like reading my messages . newline newline modulation . i quickly designed an audio modulation device to bring my voice into their audio register . it worked perfectly . they re lucky i care so much about them . newline newline what else can there possibly be ? what else could prevent me from communicating with these creatures ? language . are you serious ? they do nt all speak the same language ? i pick up some kid from their largest landmass and they speak one language , but then i pick up a different person from a smaller landmass and they do nt even speak the same language ! how did they get so far if they do nt all speak the same language ? newline newline i was going to get two of them to speak to each other and use the ships onboard computer to learn the language and then translate for me , but the kid kept crying and the other one just screamed . newline newline forget this . let the asteroid hit them . i m done . newline newline edit : spelling and clarity .this is my best take on this particular alternate universe version this eu . try as i might , i  m never going to be able to infuse it with the fully poetry of tolkien , so i  ll stop revising now and simply post it as is .  newline newline . newline newline he had found them on the very slopes of orodruin . the two bedraggled hobbits had been hindered by the pathetic slinking creature , whom sauron had allowed to escape so it could serve him as a hunter . his instinct had served him well after all . they had killed it , but the time it took them to do so had been their undoing . the one ring was now back upon the dark lord s hand , and the hobbits had paid the price for opposing him . newline newline only one tiny worm of discontent had crept into sauron s mind : at the end , when he had expected them to fall into their darkest despair and agony , they had instead called out something . it had sounded like a name , but so faint he could not quite make it out . and then they had settled into a quiet , peaceful sleep that lasted despite all he could do to further their torment . he had found it most unsettling , yet he paid it little mind for he had a world to conquer . newline newline now the gaze of the dark lord seeped slowly across the lands of the west like a poisonous cloud . it paid little heed any longer to the broken enemies who lay dead or dying before the gates of his land . amid blood and smoke and ruin could yet be heard the wails of the dying , and it would be said by future generations that those who died more swiftly were counted among the fortunate . a few had fled south and west , returning to minas tirith , but that too was also according to his plan , for he intended that they should spread tidings of this day to their peoples as unwitting heralds of further doom yet to come . newline newline the eight nazgul who remained to him spread out , now more a part of him than ever . with the one ring upon his finger , they were once again eyes and hands with which to spy or strike . one eye remained darkened forever now  oh , cursed shield maiden   her suffering would be long indeed , in due course  but no matter , for other slaves he now had . the ishtari , for example , had surprised him greatly . how well he had kept his secret , though little good it did him once the one ring had been restored to its proper place . of the maia , his proud will held far longer than the scions of men out of which the dark lord had fashion his nazgul , but in the end , he too had been broken and enslaved . newline newline now northward , and westward sauron  s gaze roamed . and there  ah , there !  lying exposed before his gaze , lothlorien . long hidden by the witch of the golden wood , but no more . with a thought , sauron tore away the woven veils , leaving her secrets exposed as well . too late she realized her peril , and attempted to remove her ring , but his will was adamant , and he ensnared her , crumbling her defenses . throughout her realm , golden leaves fell like a blizzard , and ancient trees cracked and fell , as lands long held unchanging by her will now suffered the change of centuries in a mere moments . he sensed her despair , and he reveled in it . newline newline then suddenly he hesitated in his vengeful entertainment , for he felt a disquieting disturbance nearer to baraddur . leaving the surviving elves to flee from the newly broken remnants of their dying wood , he returned . swifter than an enraged dragon , his mind flew back to his throne room . soon once again he sat like a shadow of malice in his chamber of power atop baraddur . stirring , as if from what lesser beings might call a dream , he sat upright , attentive , trying to determine what had had drawn him back . then , there it was : a voice , echoing and seemingly without source it called out , newline newline  i see old shadow , sitting on his throne newline high in his tower all alone newline ring of fire on his hand newline in a choked and dying land .  newline newline sauron sat forward and sent out his will , trying to sense the speaker , and found still more that troubled him . though he could see no one , he sensed a presence scarcely less old than time itself . neither of the valar , nor of the maia , and yet older by far than the accursed firstborn . newline newline  from days of yore long gone and past newline i was was the first , and i ll yet be last newline look more sharp , ye one eyed cat newline sure and you re not as blind as that ?  newline newline the dark lord turned toward the insolent voice and there he was : a bright blue coat and hat he wore , and soot streaked his yellow boots . sauron recognized him only gradually , for had never given him great thought before . he was known to the firstborn as iarwain benadar , and he now stood proud and unbowed before sauron s chamber door . those who knew him just recently would have said his face looked curiously older , as if with a very recent addition of years . or perhaps it was simply that his face was lined as if he smiled often , but he was not smiling now . he looked , in fact , uncharacteristically grim and most displeased . newline newline sauron sat back on his throne once more , and at once all his doubts and fears left him . little he knew of iarwain benadar , also known to some as tom bombadil , but he knew enough to satisfy him that the old man was no threat to his new found power . newline newline insolent fool , his mind projected , you have left your bounds , and can not threaten me here .  newline newline  threaten you ?  bombadil asked mildly , the mere ghost of an amused smile quirking at his lips .  and who says i m here to threaten you ? a little more nervous than you might like to admit , are you ? big powerful maia like you ? for shame .  newline newline i fear no one any longer , fool . only the valar might challenge me , but they will not . nay , they have forsaken these lands . in due course , i shall come for you . be wise and return whence you came , until i come to break you .  newline newline  oh , now who is doing the threatening ?  asked bombadil ,  and a fine joke you ve made of it too . go back , you say ? and if i did that , how would you break me then ?  newline newline sauron rose from his throne then . and were there mortal eyes to look upon him then , to them it would have seemed he grew in stature far beyond the bounds of the chamber and towered like a malevolent threat of violence . but no mortal eyes were there to see , and for his part , tom bombadil simply chuckled dryly as if witnessing a pretty parlor trick . annoyed , sauron reached out to draw still more deeply upon his powers . newline newline then , the dark lord faltered , as a new and frightening realization came to him . then bombadil smiled , and held aloft the one ring , peeping through it like a monocle , and asked ,  is it this you re looking for ?  and for a moment the old man cackled in something like a shadow of his usual mirthful self . newline newline the rage of sauron was boundless then . he had no idea how the miserable trickster had done this deed , yet long had he been sundered from his ring , and he would not suffer it to happen again . even without the ring , his power was a thing to be feared , and he drew forth from the air a burning lash of pure fire , and struck with it , faster than an adder . but fast as he was , the being known as iarwain benadar was impossibly much faster , and by the time the lash could fall , he was simply gone . newline newline then then land of mordor shook violently under sauron s rage . mountains spewed fire , and cast down boulders . guard towers broke apart and everywhere his slaves cowered in terror , knowing that their master s fury was aroused . from the furthest reaches of the lands where he had sent them , the eight spun about in their flights an raced back to their master s call . newline newlinei reach my hand up and grab the rock above me to pull myself up the side of the rocky cliff . i figured that if i made it to the top of this cliff side i might be able to see where my plane had landed . amazingly , i had survived the jump out of it with only minor injury but my plane , and the survival pack inside of it had all landed somewhere on the other side of the island . newline newline i place both my hands on the top of the cliff and grunt as i struggle to lift myself onto the plateau . apparently rock climbing immediately after jumping out of a plane was nt a good idea . newline newline rolling onto my back , i stare up at the sky and attempt to catch my breathe , but it s knocked out of me again when i turn my gaze to the beach shore . piles of trash as far as the eye can see litter the shore . although the sight made me extremely worried for the earth and the state of the environment , it also filled me with hope as something useful could easily be hidden in the mounds of junk that lay on the beach . newline newline i roll onto my stomach and quickly descend down the cliff side towards the beach shore , dreaming of all the tools i could fine in the rubbish . once at an appropriate height , i leap down onto the ground and race to the beach to begin my search . i dig through the first pile i reach and am immediately greeted with a small tamagotchi toy . newline newline  that s weird  i laugh as i hold up the toy ,  i had one just like this in elementary school  . the trend continues as i dig further into the pile . toys i had left on playgrounds , jackets i had left at school , and even headphones i had forgotten on bus seats comprised the pile of trash in front of me . it was through this observation that i discover the piles were all made up of things that i had lost at some point in my life . newline newline i spend the rest of the day reliving childhood memories and reuniting with items i thought i would never see again . i start on one end of the beach and make my way to the other throughout the day , placing items i think are important , or things i just like into a backpack i had left on an airplane when i was 13 . newline newline the sun was just setting as i finally make my way to the final heap when the shape of another human figure caught my eye . they stood a little ways away from the pile , their back turned to me . i feel my heart leap at the sight as it meant i wouldn  t be alone on this island after all . newline newline  hey !  i call out to them , but they continue to face away from me .  hey !  i yell louder this time and being to run towards them . their head perks up this time , a signal that they  ve heard , and they turns their body to face me . newline newline my heart stops as i realize that it s the unmistakable face of my exwife .last night was really all sort of a blur . newline it was around 4 am and josh woke me and damon up because he wanted to do something , i dunno . he was really spooked or like , just really excited , or on something . i dunno . newline so damon came over to my place and then we went out to meet josh . we met him outside of the local walmart , made a stop at some liquor store , and then drove out somewhere with a 6pack of jack daniels . we stopped in the parking lot of one of those 247 minimarts on the side of some interstate highway , and the three of us sat in damons old vw corrado . the thing is , or was , a piece of crap . at least it got the job done . newline so josh was talking really fast about like , the night of our lives and how it will never be the same . i guess he was right but for me , at least , it has nt changed all that much . anyway , he shoves a ski mask and a gun into our hands and tells us to put the mask on and something about the gun not working or something . i dunno . newline so he tells us to follow him into the store and damon is yelling at him . i just kinda stand there , or follow , i forget . newline so josh runs into the store , i follow right behind and josh is yelling at the store clerk , who s chinese , short , a bit plump . seems like a nice guy , hardworking . i dunno . so the clerk guy throws up his hands and josh is yelling at him with a bag in his hand or something . i do nt really remember the rest , i dunno . newline i m just standing there , then josh tells me to run to the car , so i get in the back seat . it was around then i realised damon was gone . i ask where he is and josh tells me to shut up and look for cops . i dunno . the next thing i remember is blasting down the highway at god only knows how fast , and then waking up at home , with a gun on my nightstand and a dirty ski mask on the floor . i could nt remember a thing . i think i was hungover this morning . i dunno . newline i called damon , no ring , no answer . i called josh , it rung but no answer . maybe he was still sleeping , i dunno . newline i took an advil for my aching head , pretty much confirmed my thoughts of being hungover . newline i made some coffee , laid back down . crazy night , i guess . i dunno i do nt know . i picked it from a whole bunch of boxes because it had one of these ... men with four legs and four arms on it . you know , in a circle ? like on that biology book of yours .  newline newline she stares at me for a moment , a strange mix of irritation and amusement on her face . newline newline  i mean , who would ve thought anyone would send us anything back at all ? it s all just modern kid s toys and wannabe science and stuff .  newline newline   frank , it s not about the science or the test . remember what i told you about mr. gall and his ... experiments . it does nt work , never has ... it s about the people behind it , the motivations .  newline newline   what ?  newline newline she sighed , looked down , glanced at the letter on the table . newline newline   look , frank , it does not matter what the test did , if it is accurate or if there was even a test in the first place . i mean , it does nt look like they put a lot of effort into making it believable . here , unknown and unidentifiable  , what is that supposed to mean ? if i were to create such a test , i sure as hell would not put anything on the result sheet that would make it look even more like a pseudoscience that does nt have its methods straight .  newline newline   you re not making any sense . and why are you so upset about the whole thing at all ?  newline newline   we re at war , frank . people are killing each other just because someone thinks some people are better than others because some of their physical features have different measurements .  newline newline the sudden knock at the door makes her flinch . newline newline   who the hell ...  , i murmur , getting up . three gentlemen in suits are standing in the doorway . i take a look past them and notice three dark fords parked across the street . newline newline   good evening . is this the andrews residence ?  newline newline   yes , but   newline newline   police , sir . it has been brought to our attention that a certain margot kchele is living here . under the us justice department s enemy alien control program , we have been ordered to detain persons of german ancestry until further notice . comply and you shall not be harmed .  newline newline confused , i turn around . she is standing at the far side of the room , pale and shaking . newline newline   i love you  , she says , quietly .i stand face to face with my opponent , our eyes locked . if he feels any fear , he certainly shows no sign . newline newline i loosely throw my arm down and then return it to its original position so my bicep and forearm make a right angle . newline newline the world has never seen stakes so large . gambling always changed lives , but never so directly . i throw down my arm again and pull it back up . newline newline we mouth the same words , a ritual performed many times in the past . but i don  t think anyone could see the words actually having significance . the winner takes the other  s life . newline newline i throw my arm down one more time . i see my opponent do the same . as i pull my arm back up , i know i must make a decision . sweat runs down my forehead , my heart racing . newline newline what is his plan ? would he truly risk his life for such a diabolical ploy ? i have no time to think . i must deceive him . it is the only way . yes , it  s time for action . newline newline as i throw my arm down for the final time , i curl my hand into a fist . he  ll never see it coming . as my arm reaches the critical point , i stop . my heart stops . am i truly ready to accept the consequences of defeat ? i look down , relieved . my life is saved . newline newline  rock beats scissors ,  i coolly announce . im rick dragonson and this is my lawn shop . i work here with my old man , and my son : big haus . everything in here has a legend , and a price . one thing ive learned after 21 years , you never know whats gon na come through that gate .  newline newline sitting in the shop one day a man walks in . comes straight to the counter and lays a giant broad sword on the table . im taken a bit aback by how forward he is .  what do we have here ?  i ask already knowing the title of the sword on my countertop .  this , is the original excaliber   he says trying to make it sound wonderous . i pick up the world and inspect it a little . ornately crafted , but still battle worthy , the sword is old enough to be excaliber .  mind if i call in an expert ? i have a buddy who knows all about these old swords .  i ask the man who agrees . a few minutes later an old wizard walks into the store  merlin !  i saw sounding glad to see an old business partner . merlin strides up the the table and picks up the sword unceremoniously inspects it .  hmm ... its a good fake . definitely not the real deal . but certain collectors like recreations . plus it s definitely battle worthy . one of these would sell on the market for ...  there s a long pause as the man waits in anticipation .  5 gold pieces .  the man looks angry .  this is the real deal . my great grandfather pulled it from the stone himself !  merlin with a twinkle in his eye laughs and says  who do you think made the thing . i did . watch , the real excaliber will stick into the ground and only the true heir will be able to pull it out , if you are his descendant you should be able to pull it free .  after a bit more discussion we got outside and merlin slams the sword into the ground . the man pulls it free with no problem and says  see ! ?  merlin taking the sword and plunging it back to the earth says  that proves nothing .  as he gestures for me to pull it out . one good tug and the sword is free . the man looking defeated says  just give me 6 gold pieces and its yours .  i inspect the sword a bit and say  i can sell it for 5 . best i can do for you is 2 .  the man sighs and says  sure.. 2 is good .  i give him his gold pieces and he goes on his way . walking inside with merlin i ask  how did you know id be able to pull it out ?  merlin chuckles , the sword doesnt stick unless i put a spell on it . should fetch a fine price . i can expect my usual finders fee ?  shrugging i reply  yeah , yeah 1  .  as i put the sword in the case labeled the real excaliber : 50,000 gold pieces .  newline newline as i finish a man walks up and says he s got something i might be interested in . i follow him outside and as i see it i find myself repeating my old motto .  i do nt do seige weapons .  standing in front of me in a 30ft tall monster of a trebuchet .  sorry man , i m not interested .  behind me i hear my son  i do nt know pops , i might be .   big haus , what are you gon na do with a trebuchet ?   who knows i might throw a giant wooden rabbit over the castle walls .  i throw my hands up showing im washing my hand of this and go inside . 20minutes later big haus informs me he bought the monstrosity for 10,000 gold pieces .  do you know if it even works ?  i ask him already writing of the money as lost forever .  well ... no .  he replies  but that s half the fun , we can fire it to see .  newline newline so there we are , the end of the day . this trebuchet set up ready to throw a pumpkin . it takes the whle crew to man this beast , but finally its ready . big haus starts the count down  3 . 2 . 1 .  and pulls the lever . woosh !  the arm springs forward launching the pumpkin out over the castle walls into the village outside , its truely a sight to behold . just as the cry of victory leaves big haus  mouth sure enough the arm of the launcher breaks clean in half . the weight is thrown to the ground ropes snap all over the place . when all is said and done nothing is left thats bigger than a 2by4 ...  its coming out of your pay .  i laugh as we roll to credits .everyday was a pain to live , and no matter how hard he tried , he could never escape his feeling of despair . his entire life , he spent trying to find a pleasure in life he could do . every time he had true bliss at hand , it was snapped away from him , whether it was from his rival always showing him up , or the people around him just going out of their way to get at him . he thought that it was just the people around him that caused the man misery , but he knew deep down that he would never be happy . he readied the shotgun to his face , and pulled the trigger , finally feeling the bliss he always wanted . newline newline it took only a few hours for the bikini bottom police to find squidward s body .well , here it goes . i did nt do a lot of editing , i more or less wrote as it came to me , with some changes made for organization . i m satisfied with it , though . furthermore , i m leaving the large space because i m  new here  and do nt know how to make lines . newline newline newline newline to be perfectly honest , i thought it would be a little more dramatic than this . newline newline i ve seen plenty of movies , read plenty of books about it . mostly it s depicted as sudden and heartbreaking and terrible the earth cracking open , volcanoes spewing fire and ash , maybe even a behemoth of a tsunami wiping a coastal city off the map , sending thousands of screaming people to a watery grave . but whoever thought the end of the world would begin so calmly as this ? newline newline the sun has stopped moving . that much is obvious to anyone who cares to look outside . in fact , you do nt even have to go out there is nt a station on tv that s not talking about it . the clocks tick on , sure , but it seems the universe has picked today to break its own rules and stop making sense . because screw planet earth , right ? newline newline the way i see it , humankind was bound to destroy itself sooner or later . we did nt have long to go before we blew ourselves skyhigh with nuclear weapons . or maybe we d take the slow route , poisoning our own environment for decades until there is nothing consumable left . people are kind of like monsters that way always consuming , stupidly selfish . maybe we did nt directly cause the sun to hover in the sky , but i feel , somehow , we re behind it . maybe god looked down on the world and decided it was time to start over . maybe planet earth is alive , and wants us gone once and for all . maybe the entire universe is falling to pieces . it had a beginning , according to the big bang theory , so it must have an end , right ? newline newline so why no big bang in the end ? why only silence , and the smell of fear ? newline newline i do nt know . no one knows . anything s possible . the point is , the earth halted its orbit , leaving some of us trapped in an eternal day with the other side of the world frozen in everlasting night . nobody knows if earth will ever start moving again . newline newline anyways , like i said , i figured we did nt have much longer to go . i just did nt expect today to be the day . newline newline most people are worried . not panicking , because nothing violent has happened yet . extreme ? sure . but disastrous , deadly ? there s no explosions , no chance of immediate and brutal death . if the sun is going to kill us , it will take a while . in truth , people do nt really understand what s going on . they hope it will go back to normal . me ? i m not worried . not even scared , honestly . i do nt mind that the world is ending . the volcanoes , the earthquakes , the floods , the storms ... they have nt happened yet , but i m sure they will . that s when people will panic and the dying will start . and though it will be sad ... it will also be , in its own strange way , incredibly beautiful . newline newline so i ll wait here , sipping lemonade , on what began as a typical day and ended as ... oh , wait . it will never end . that s the funniest thing , really . today will never end . but everything else will .the room was buried on the fourth level of the prison system , nearly a hundred feet underground . it was rumored to be the portal to a thriving ecosystem of convicts , each responsible for contributing to a better society . in reality , we simply called it the gateway to hell and so far as anyone knew , no one had ever escaped . newline newline  convict 2271 . step forward ,  the warden called out . newline newline he was a short man with a calm demeanor and a balding head , but he was the one man you never wanted to piss off . they say you always look out for the anger of a gentle man and no one was gentler than warden mckay . newline newline i stepped forward at his request , though it was largely a formality . everyone in the room already knew my fate . i could feel the eyes of those i d been accused of injuring behind the glass wall to my rear . i d be allowed to address them before my sentencing , but there was nothing i wanted to say that was nt already said . newline newline  convict , you stand accused of a number of crimes , many of them serious offenses . today you will be offered a chance to redeem yourself and contribute to a meaningful society . you are hereby sentenced to spend the rest of your natural life underground . to the rest of the world , you are dead . your sentence will be carried out immediately . do you have anything you wish to say ?  warden mckay spoke in a clear , practiced voice . this was something he did often . newline newline he d heard about other men crying and having to be tossed into the room , but he was nt going to be one of those . not today . not with his family watching . he d made a promise to himself that he d go with his head held high . at least he wast those condemned to death . newline newline he looked the warden in the eye and shook his head no . he also risked a glance back into the glass where his family was watching , but all he saw was a broken man standing before the mouth of hell . newline newline  then go forth and prosper and may god have mercy upon your soul ,  warden mckay said . he handed him a backpack that felt suspiciously light along with a single led lamp and stepped back . newline newline he could see the guards take a halfstep forward , ready to push him in if need be . some did nt fancy the idea of spending their lives beneath the ground , but he was nt one of those either . he was going to find a way out or die trying . he took a step forward and then was through the doorway . the door swung shut behind him with a hiss . that s when the stench hit him . newline newline it was the smell of death . he d been expecting as much but the wave of nausea gripped him and sent him to his knees . he knew he d have to keep going . he had to . he rose to his feet and opened the bag , hoping for a strip of cloth or a mask , but all he found was an envelope . within that was a single pill and a note asking for forgiveness . he crumpled the note and dropped the pill . he d never been a pill pusher anyways . he was going to escape . he d made a promise after all and ... newline newline the ground gave way beneath him and he fell . he screamed until he hit the ground which was still littered with the bones and decaying bodies of the other convicts sentenced to the same fate , but his body did nt break . something had broken his fall . newline newline he felt other s rushing to his side , helping him off the flimsy cloth stretched across the mouth of the pit . at his feet , he saw the bones of others who had nt been so lucky . newline newline  what ...  he tried asking but his voice was raw from screaming . newline newline  relax , brother . you re alive ,  the voice said .  they meant for you to take that drop and they meant for all of us to die down here . there were never any plans for a society , but we ve proven them wrong . come with me and see what we ve created .  but linda  i retorted  remember your resent . clutch it and hold on to that . it s real .  newline newline  gee i do nt know doc , i mean i want to be resentful .  linda said  but i just , well i mean i do nt feel it the same way i did before .  newline newline  hunny that s amazing !  the buffoon of a husband chimed in .  and doc , just so you know because well , i think it s a milestone , last night we ... well we ...  newline newline  made love , for an hour , and it was incredible !  linda confirmed . newline newline  indeed . and when i was ready to climax i ...  the husband began , but i cut him off . newline newline  whoa whoa whoa ... way too much information slugger .  i warned him .  i m just trying to understand why linda is so resentful , i mean you are resentful , are nt you linda ?  newline newline  i do nt know anymore ! i want to be , but i think it has passed . i just get all tingly now when i see him . i feel we re in love again and everything else matters much less than it did .  linda informed me , though she stared at that manipulative asshole the entire time . he wore the biggest shit eating grin . i had finally had enough . newline newline  linda , i slept with your husband . i came here thinking it was gods county , yeah newline . they welcomed me at first , got to known their names their hobbies , their families and friends . i felt accepted . then a switch triggered , some said it did nt matter what those other people did . but they never did look me in the eyes like before . i was . fine being an outcast . a could get by with my job and my work . but they could never let it rest . i was a foreign virus to them . newline newline so i gave them something back . showed them i would nt take it . i became what they thought i was . but even more terrifying . they wanted a villian , might as well give them the devil it had been about three weeks now , and every time i would see people coming back , telling me it had worked , and i was as amazed as them . i was nt sure what i was doing , so i never really expected it to take off . i guess that people were tossing my name around because every day i d have more customers . newline newline then it happened . newline newline i could nt live like this anymore . everyday more and more . the guilt started consuming me from the inside , so many people had trusted me , and i had lied to them , but i was the only one that knew . i had to stop this before it got out of hand , before somebody had their heart broken , or lost their job , or god forbid , something worse . newline newline and so , as more sleepless nights went on , i thought of more ways to shut down my shop . at first i sent a note to the local newspaper , anonymously exposing myself , but the publisher who , to my surprise , had already been a customer rejected my claims saying that their predictions had come true . newline newline at this point my life was an absolute hell . so when i was driving back home i thought of an infallible plan . i would give a prediction doomed to fail . so i did . the next day , a young man came into my office . he walked in very calmly , and as i grabbed his palm , he asked  what do you see ?  . i lied , and while breathing heavily and unsteadily said  oh no . oh no .  and repeated that a few times . he , obviously worried , asked  what s wrong   iiits just , i ve never seen this before  i stuttered . i knew he was scared , because he said  what did you see ?   this is horrible  at this point he became mad and slammed his fist on the table and yelled :  what did you see ?  i , while maintaining character to keep it as believable as possible said  you will die tomorrow  he was shocked , and nervously asked  hhow   you will get run over by an orange car , the driver will be a middle aged man , and it will be hailing .  i said.  no way , that s impossible , you re full of crap  he said while leaving my office . it was done , he had believed it , now all i had to do was wait for him to come back tomorrow and call me out for the fraud i was . but the next day , the only thing i saw was the news report , describing the death of 23 year old kevin greyson who did nt survive the collision against a honda civic .we will leave the mating process of the alpha male be for a moment as we return to the weaker male of this tribe . newline although he has been stalking his prey for quite some time now , his efforts have been unfruitful . newline as the boy prepares himself for luring in a female for the fifth time , he decides to take a different approach . where at first he tried to mimic the alpha s approach , dressing like the jocks , copying their speech patterns and manner of movement . he now tries to be himself . newline he prepares for one final stalk before he attacks . now this might seem abstract but he s finding another female to have a conversation with about his prey . newline the other female got the bait and is now talking in rivers about the stalker s prey . newline here we see something common with weaker males , when they ve gathered enough information about their prey and think they ve found enough matching interests they will feel confident enough to start their attack . newline and so the boy starts his attack . newline he opens whatsapp and takes her number from the groupschat . newline his approach might seem unorthodox but is actually very common among the weaker males . newline he begins with the usual sweet talk . admiring her achievements , talking about her personal life and there ! he strikes ! he sees an opportunity and grabs it . he pivots the conversation to him , talking about their shared interests . newline now we will see him doing the first part of the mating ritual . he asks her out on what is called  a date  .  a date  is a conversation held in purpose doing a normal activity . newline she did not take the bait . newline the weaker male is retreating to his bathroom to relieve his pain in individual sexual pleasure .frost swirled around shin as he walked among the lights of old shanghai . transit vehicles blitzed by in the frozen darkness , their lights blinking in the lifeless night . shin wandered forward at a meandering pace , his right leg stiffer and heavier than his right leg . visibly dangerous , his mission would end if metro police spotted him .  hey !  someone called out to him in chinese , shin turned slowly toward the sound . private security , shin had probably wandered into their territory .  looking for a hand out ?  shin barked in shitty mandarin . as the men closed on him shin revealed the inside of his trench coat . the men disappeared into the frost . shin marched forward . it would nt be far now . newline newline shin generally had no problems with terraforma corp. from what he read about them they kept to themselves mostly . they definitely did more good then they did bad .  that s too bad ...  shin labored forward , his words frost in a starless sky . shin saw the building up ahead it s edges hard and clear even in the snowstorm . the security gate .  stop !  shin heard the guard yell in japanese . the guard paused a moment , he recognized shin s battle frame .  shin , get the fuck out of here  a a chill wind blew between the two men .  it s not a good day ,  the guards english was spotty , but shin forgave him , he was a decent man .  today is the only day seikesan , get the fuck out of here and open that gate .  mr. seike did as he was told and got the fuck out of there , he knew that look on shin s face . the gate opened to a snow covered yard , maybe 300 yards in diameter . cold concrete on every side with no visible entryways . that was fine with shin he was almost there . in the distance shin could see guards scrambling to get in defensive positions , their breath drifting skyward , if they opened fire now things could get hairy . shin raised his hands and yelled surrender in 4 different languages . shin was counting , he knew exactly where he d have to detonate . once he was there he released his payload . a series of loud clicks released the payload from his chasis , a large cross like structure dramatically revealed itself in front of shin . shin dropped to the ground from the effort . the guards opened fire , molten projectiles lit the courtyard . the cross bounced into the sky sending up a mist of snow then ignited the air around it . a tremendous blast wave ripped through old shanghai . newline newline minutes later shin stirred in the snow , his battle frame was rocked , but it was designed for this type of scenario . shin sifted through the rubble looking for something . cold metal hands gripped a heavy door . a loud clang as shin ripped the door from it s hinges . a gust of warm pungent air wafted over shin . shin winced in surprise . an old man leading a skittish group looked up at him framed in an opalescent moonlight wrapped in swirling snow . newline newline  are you god ?  newline shin smiled .  no , but my employer is . this way .  newline newline as shin lead the group out and away from the blast sight , he spared a look back . the ordinance had carved a giant cross through old shanghai . it s message was clear . not to him , but shin was sure the message was clear to someone . newline newline findear journal , march 17 : newline newline today was an ok day . i got a job at china grill ! they made a better offer than king wok , even though i like king wok s food better . oh well , money is money , right ! newline newline march 19 : newline newline well , journal , today was interesting . we had a meeting with chin lei , owner of china grill . he told us king wok was working on a secret food item that would put us out of business . he had us all take an oath to  preserve and protect china grill ,  or something crazy like that . just trying to motivate us , i suppose . newline newline march 27 : newline newline journal , i have nt updated you in a week or so since my job had gotten pretty hectic . i had to spend the night at the store last night ! chin lei said that spies  actual freaking spies !  from king wok might try and sabotage our food . he said that , for safety reasons , we needed to keep watch at the store . me and a few other folks stood watch all night , taking turns sleeping . i m beat now , but i ll give more updates later . newline newline newline april 3 : newline newline journal , things got out of hand today . a customer was halfway through his place of chow mein and he keeled over ... dead . i do nt know how it happened . we stood watch all night , no one got near our food ... unless ... could it have been an inside job ? we just hired two new people , maybe one of them is a king wok double agent . i have to call chin right away ! newline newline april 4 : newline newline chin thanked me for helping find the double agent . he rewarded me an extra 10 minute break and a free helping of chow mein . not sure if i trust the chow mein just yet ... better let this whole feud thing settle down before i eat here ... or at king wok ... for a while . newline newline april 6 : newline newline well journal , i quit my job today . things just got too crazy at china grill ! yesterday , another customer keeled over while eating . luckily , we have medics standing by 247 , so they were able to pump his stomach and save his life . unfortunately , an hour later , one of the guys from king wok came over and stabbed chin in the eye ! blood went everywhere , but mostly in the kung pao chicken that chin passed out into . we had at least three customers in line while we made more . newline newline today was the dealbreaker though . chin handed me a revolver and a picture of lu pet , one of the managers of king wok . chin had an informant inside king wok , as well , and we had found out that the hit on chin had been put out by lu . i ditched my apron and went incognito for the hit . i pretended to order some fried rice and orange chicken  my favorite from king wok  , then tried to shoot the revolver while it was still in my pocket at the last second . sadly , i missed lu and ended up hitting greg , this guy i went to school with last year . greg died , the police came , and i did nt even get any of my orange chicken . crazy thing was they ended up arresting lu ! chin offered to give me another free helping of the chow mein , but i turned it down and told him i had to call it quits . besides , with greg dead and lu in jail , king wok is going to be short staffed , and they made me an offer i really ca nt refuse  an extra buck an hour !upon seeing the ghastly crime scene , my heart sank . so much blood . my mind was racing . could this be possible ? no , walker faced the chair ... i saw it myself . the light had gone out in his eyes . he was gone . toast . history . just a memory at this point . i felt almost overwhelmed . there was a tap on my shoulder . it was detective banksy . newline  banksy !  i said , almost gasping for breath ,  are you trying to give me a heart attack ?  newline newline  is everything alright ?  she asked .  you seem ... off .  newline newline  everything is fine detective . should nt you be logging evidence or brushing for fingerprints ?  i asked . newline newline  apologies sir ... you seemed flustered is all ...  newline newline  no hard feelings detective . just continue with your work  newline newline but it was all a lie . everything was not fine . there was only one criminal in all my years on the force that had ever portrayed death in such an unsettling and gruesome manner . walker . one of the few people that i d let slip through the cracks time after time . but it was over . i finished this glorified game of cat and mouse five years ago when he was sentenced to the chair . it was done . this was not a copy cat . the infamous killer had plastered his trade marks all over the crime scene , as if to taunt me . as if he knew i would be the one to lead the investigation . as if he knew i would be one of the few to pick up on the subtleties he had left behind . most of my colleagues had retired after the walker incident . they could nt handle it . most of them were scared and bruised internally and went for an early retirement to open a restaurant or go to disneyland or some shit . cowards . all of them . i could nt help but notice  newline newline suddenly there was a dead silence . no talking . no running about . everything seemed to be at a stand still . the only sound to be heard was an unusual static coming from our radios . confusion began to set in . this was nt a normal sound coming from these devices we used to communicate with one another . it was different . almost familiar . newline after a brief moment there was a voice . echoing through the radio of every detective and officer on the scene . newline newline  hello mckinnly  the familiar voice said . newline it ca nt be . this is ... this is impossible . i felt the eyes of my comrades staring into my soul . newline newline  i hope you enjoyed the sweet taste of victory over these past few years . but it appears there were a few things you overlooked . a few loose ends that were nt quite tied off . i m coming for you mckinnly . game on .  newline newline my heart sank . i looked at my team . the looks of horror that were on their faces was ... unnerving . newline he was right . newline the game was on .oh , the weather outside is frightful . newline filled with malice most wrathful . newline but someone must go brave the storm . newline free us from this thriller and murdereous killer newline that s making a graveyard of our dorm . newline newline the storm surge is here newline bringing fury and fear , newline the killer is uncomfortably close newline i ve seen his knife flash and after each slash newline a screaming coed gives up the ghost . newline newline this christmas is dark . newline cold , cruel , and stark . newline but we invited the grinch to stay newline come to our dorm and ignore the storm newline we ll party all night and day . newline newline but the grinch has stolen christmas , newline our lives and our wish lists newline with a nine inch silver blade . newline we cried and we died with mistletoe brides , newline and what s worse , i never got laid . newline newlinethe less time here the better . i want to sit in the closest seat to the exit so when the bus stops i can get off quickly .  lately i ve been thinking about they day they took my father away . the look of fear on his face . . . and anger .  after a certain age , around 7 or 8 , most children lose their emotions and are then on their way to becoming a normal part of society . others on the hand , like my father , do nt . it happens sometimes . i think it s called emotional personality disorder . people with  epd  are considered a danger to society and themselves because they have an extremely high probability to react illogically and dangerously .  i was a late bloomer myself . i was almost 9 before i  lost  my emotions . i remember a story i overheard my father tell someone about a coworker of his that just pretended not to have any emotions , the coworker was almost 28 before they caught him . so that s what i started doing too . i could overhear other kids ask each other if they thought i had epd , it was the only thing i could do .  i pretended for years and years . now here i am , a junior in high school , top 10  in my class . my future can be bright . i wonder how my father would react to me , emotions and all . he told me the truth about 5 years ago . that he had emotions and was so happy that i did too . he had been pretending for almost 40 years , tears ran down his face . he looked at me and then i realized . . . i did nt care . so that s why i turned him in .  i had been caught up in pretending to not have emotions for so long i never realized when they actually left . i wonder if i could have laughed at the irony so many years ago . and now that the bus arrived at school earlier than normal i can turn in my paper before class starts and i ll get full credit .     this is my first attempt . i would really appreciate feedback . hope you enjoyed ! day 15 in the cardiac icu . it  s my third 30 hour shift . i can barely keep my eyes open . at 0700 we switch shifts finally , only one more hour to go . i was told this year would be bad . i had no fucking clue . seriously , don  t do this profession . newline newline  doctor !  a nurse cried . you know that cry , it  s the one that crawls up the back of your spine and sits on top of your head controlling your feet into a dead run .  room 12 is coding !  all the training the world doesn  t prepare your for that . you can take acls courses all you want . the first time you run a code you pray the nursing staff knows what they  re doing , luckily in the icu they always dohere at least . newline newline he had a name . i couldn  t remember it . he was here  critically ill gets you through the door in this place . we know a number of them will not make it . not remembering their names allow you to go home in a way you can put this place into a mental trunk so you can take care of your family . newline newline  get the crash cart !  the staff is moving smoothly to their positions . one to record time and drugs given , every two minutes is important in the acls protocol . there should be two or three  if you  re lucky  people to start chest compression , a few more people to help with airway , access , tests and the defibrillator . newline newline it  s scary when it becomes a reflex , but that is when you know you  re good at it . it  s also about the time that people become a disease . for your own sanity your brain categorizes them this way . to look into every face and see the fear , grief , love , life and intensity of the soul can crush you . you can  t be crushed , to many rely on the honed skills you  ve been acquiring for years . newline newline the code lasts 30 minutes . two shocks , 6 rounds of epi and adrenaline through my veins results in time of death at 0640 . the failure isn  t the worst part . it  s calling the loved one having them come in and looking deep into their intense broken eyes . you can  t escape the intensity here , it  s impossible . it  s when you know that at this moment you are their worst villain . newline newline it never fails  you remember each one , especially in the beginning and the hidden tears . god the hidden tears , the ones the families never see.if only they knew . newlinesome of the women shared it as a first name . some as a middle name . most of the men had it as a last name . there were even some related to each other  a pair of twins had appeared together a few days after i did . newline newline our numbers were growing . every day or so , another group appeared in a random location in the facility . they all had something in common . newline newline they were trapped here . newline newline and everyone here was named morgan . newline newline except for me , of course . newline newline when i had woken up in that room , with four others , and the mob burst in the door wielding pipes , wrenches , and other assorted tools they questioned us first , before accepting us . i was the last to go . they asked for my name . i lied , of course . everyone here was named morgan  what would they do of they knew i was nt ? newline newline once they brought us into their fold , they explained the situation . we were all trapped in a large facility . scott morgan , who worked for the city s utilities in oregon , said he believed it was an underground water treatment plant . morgan bates , a chemist from europe , claimed that the water they had found was safe to drink , and could sustain us with the limited food supply they had stumbled upon . another morgan , whose name i forget , was a cartographer , and had spent days mapping out the facility . as of yet they had found no doors , no tunnels to the surface , and no way out . newline newline i asked how people got in . no one knew . newline newline i met many more morgans . morgan jenkins , the surgeon from nevada who kept us all alive . larry morgan , the politician from chicago , who kept trying to elect himself  leader  but was generally ignored . there were roughly 200 at that time . that was three weeks ago . newline newline three weeks i ve wondered where we are , in reality . three weeks i wonder how we have kept everyone alive . newline newline i suppose us morgans have to stick together , right ? newline newline i keep my true identity a guarded secret . but i always have my name written , inside my left jacket pocket , so i wo nt forget . it could be years before we escape . newline newline but it seems my secrets may not be my own any longer . newline newline yesterday , one of the men found a hidden panel in a wall , leading to a small office . there was a running computer nay , supercomputer that looked like it ran the whole facility . but it was locked . all there was to help us was a single note . newline newline  user : jonfromwalmart  newline newline  password hint : your last name  newline newline newline newlinegod pulled anxiously at his beard , the silence damning . the multiverse admissions council sat at their table , the traditionalists scratching away with quills , the younger immortals submitting their observations into the ever present one thought . all around , the walls of the auditorium glowed blue . it was designed to keep any intrusive eyes from peering in , whether from the past , present , or future , all so that the omnipotent couldn  t foresee what faults the council would find in their various projects . newline newline  ... wellllll ,  said one of the beings , his wisps of light glowing in consideration .  it seems very fleshed out , i would say . but three dimensions seems a little lacking.  newline newline  aah , uh , see ,  stammered god , shifting through his papers .  i originally intended on five , but , uh , i found that it  s much simpler to establish organic life in three . most research shows that complex lifeforms evolve much quicker when their surroundings are much easier to perceive.  newline newline  yes ,   boomed the ancient one of considerable mass , most of his form hidden within the three whole universes it resided in .  it worked quite well with your brother  s  flatland  proposition . but , this does not excuse your universe  s apparent tendency to tear itself apart .   newline newline honest , that one . god tried to roll with the punch . newline newline  oh , entropy ?  he nearly felt like he had to cough the words out . why was his mouth so dry ?  that is for efficiency   newline newline  efficiency ?  said cold logic .  degrading your universe over time hardly seems  efficient  .  newline newline god had always hated cold logic , as did all the other students . his classes were never enjoyable , always steeped in intense realism . if it weren  t for the fact that cold logic alone could destroy all the other creators in a blink of an eye , god doubted the university would have put up with him for so long . newline newline  i  ve always noticed that , with the other graduates  universes , they always end up becoming so cluttered ,  defended god . he tried not to pull at his beard again .  organic life becomes sentient , sets out from their origin , and begin to create new mass depending on their line of technological advancement . entropy , see , prevents unlimited resources from occurring , and the universe from becoming too busy.  newline newline cold logic , ever placid , did not follow up on his query . he just stared , like always . newline newline more silence ensued before one of the laws of reality spoke up . newline newline  what about these huemans ?  asked time , its many strings of whathasbeen and whatwillbe tied up in an indecipherable ball . newline newline  humans ,  god corrected . newline newline  huemans . it  s your only intended sentient species.  newline newline god cleared his throat .  i wanted to test the limitations of curiosity . how far will a species go to confirm they  re not alone in the universe ? ideally , they  ll search until entropy catches up with them.  newline newline again , more silence , more scratching of quills , more ambient hums of the one thought . newline newline  that will be all , god ,  said the headmaster .  you may go . we will let you know the fate of your universe soon.  newline newline god gathered his papers and made to leave , silently glad it was all over . the headmaster stopped him with an abrupt  but.  newline newline the headmaster  s face tilted down , his eyes glowing with the stars of a thousand realities .  do recall you are not the first student to have the idea to create one of your species  in your image  . i would suggest refraining from committing to that small proposal.  newline newline he waved a hand . god scurried out . get me out of here , i ca nt tolerate that damn printer for another minute .  newline newline bob sat slumped , face buried in his palm . he needed an aspirin , but knew better . the last one complained endlessly about the ephemerality of its existence , screaming all the way down his gut screaming out his name and cries of help as gastric juices dissolved it into oblivion . the sofa which he was on was more caring , humming a sweet lullaby into bobby s ears . newline newline the house croaked .  i was the one who called you , bob . the damn clock is too small for you to hear from all the way . but i am getting tired of the bickering between it and the printer . so i howled my loudest , rattling all the condos a mile from here until they started howling for you to make me stop  and here you are . i m sorry for bringing you out of your cave . but please , for god s sake take one of them away or better , both of them and give them to some orphanage or dumpster or something . i do nt care , just get them out . i ca nt handle it anymore..  newline newline  yeah , steal me away bob  the printer and the clock chimed simultaneously . newline newline bob rarely stepped into the city . he preferred to live out of the land in the hills  with trees , plants , birds  living things that do nt talk . anything that humans transform with their labor , they curse it with their own personality voices that bob can hear , and it almost drove him to insanity . he now lived in the caves outside the city  with nothing for company but the beautiful , incoherent white noise of the wilderness . and the cold barrel of his grandfather s shotgun that he always kept close . newline newline  so you re the reason that caused the whole city to howl like a madman ?  bob says loudly , murderously eyeing the printer and the wall clock . newline newline  keep it down bob , the homeowners just shifted in their bed .  the bedroom door at the top of the stairs said in a low , hushed voice . newline newline  keep it down , bob ? you pieces of shit start a noise that can be heard from across the atlantic and you re asking me to keep it down ?  bob was almost shouting right now . the door was desperately clasping its hinges , trying to muffle the noise as much lest the owners got up . newline newline  bob , calm down .  the wise old shotgun , always by his side , said .  remember , you ve trained yourself . close your eyes , take a deep breath . let the voices pass through you , you can transcend this cacophony if you meditate .  newline newline  no , i will not calm down . not this time . i need to teach these pieces of shit a lesson .  he looks up to the house   make sure to relay it to every building and every object inside it make sure it reaches every garage and every vehicle  and everywhere they travel  and tell them to tell it to every warehouse and every ship and every export headed to anywhere in the world . this is what happens when you piss me off  i am the only one who can hear you scream and i will relish every moment of it .  newline newline bob grabbed the printer and the clock , went up to the attic and hid them underneath a pile of cobweb laced boxes . newline newline the house panicked , almost shuddering .  what are you doing ? the owners are hoarders , they never clean the attic ! these two will bicker undisturbed for eternity .  newline newline bob ignored it . newline newline  please bob , forgive us , we will not anger you again .  the printer and the clock begged . newline newline bob laid some boxes surreptitiously over the two . their pleas turned into curses cursing each other over whose fault it was . the bickering had nt stopped by the time bob stepped out into the front yard  still loud as ever .  you hear that bob , that is what i hear every day . please bob , do nt leave them here , i m sorry , bob  please .  newline newline  you heard that ?  bob asked the mailbox . it gave a meek yes in acknowledgment , scared .  make sure to relay it to every other house around .  newline newline  i ll howl if you leave bob . i wo nt give you a moment s peace in your life if you do nt take them away..  the creaky old house was indignant now . it howled loudly , and bob could hear it all the way to the end of the suburb . but none of the other houses or buildings joined . for the first time in his life , bob could feel all chatter stop as he walked through  a panic stricken silence he d never heard before . newline newline the lone house s defiant howling dissolved into the silence as bob entered the woods .  see that ?  bob grinned at his shotgun .  sometimes striking fear is more effective than all that zen bullshit you spout .  he kept it by his side as he reached his cave and looked at the vast , silent , sprawl of the city underneath .  where did you pick up that hippie nonsense anyway ? you re a killing machine for god s sake .  newline newline  i have been used to kill countless people , bob . and over the years i ve realized its not the worst suffering you can inflict upon your fellow man .  they sit silently for a while as the morning dawns ,  you know that better than anyone else , bob .  newline newline newline newline newline newlinemary has always been so incredibly nice to everyone , and i find it sickening . she s is always soo goddamn considerate , and everyone practically worships the bitch . her parents brag and brag about how they were blessed with such an amazing , selfless doll of a daughter . god , i hate her . newline newline one day , she was waltzing about the city with that goddamn innocent fucking smile plastered to her perfect face , enjoying her life and greeting everyone one she passed . i swear , sometimes i think she thinks she s cinderella or some shit . she was about to enter some little candy store when she sees a little girl about to run into oncoming traffic . she darts over there like a bullet and saves the girl from being hit by a car , like fucking wonder woman . the parents thanked her and she did nt even scold them for not paying attention to their kids . stupid bitch . newline newline why does she care so much about people ? once , she walked eight miles just to get a kid home . and she constantly runs errands for the elderly . she is always there for sobbing strangers that need a listening ear . she so sickeningly sweet to fucking everyone . newline newline it kills me that she can go around helping strangers , then stand there watching her own sister be killed before her fucking eyes .my feet shuffled awkwardly as we stood at the mound . the vicar s words were barely audible from where i stood over fifty feet away from where the dragon s head . he was at it s head while i was keeping a low profile over at the tail since i arrived late . some of the dragons looked at me , i avoided their stare like any reasonable person would avoid interacting with the siblings of the man you just killed . newline newline i sighed deeply and wiped my brow . what shittery was this ? there was only a small group of humans and rightly so the war between us and them had reached fever pitch before i killed veraf . newline newline suddenly all eyes shifted towards me . i turned around too hopefully it was to someone behind me , there was no one . newline newline  what did he say ?  i asked the lady next to me . newline newline  you ve been invited to the podium to say something  she replied . newline newline  the fuck ? are you joking ?  newline newline  no i m not and do nt swear . we re at a funeral  newline newline coming to its funeral was already bad enough i had no idea why this dragon had insisted i speak for it . newline newline it was too late to turn back . slowly i walked to the front . i heard snorts of hate coming from the flame breathers . two turned up their snouts and flew away in disgust as i cleared my throat . newline newline  a lot of you ummm ... might know me . we ve met before maybe not in the best of situations but ...  newline newline  monster !  a giant backplated dragon yelled at me smoke bellowing from it s nostrils . newline newline their side broke into a murmur as the stares became harder . newline newline  now people , let s remember that sir ponk was invited here . let s honor the wishes of the dead and let him speak .  the vicar said gently trying to ease the crowd . newline newline  or he s here so that we kill him  a white horned dragon said it s wings flapping open . newline newline  what no i ...  the sentence was never completed as i dodged a ball of flame . it hit the podium and burst into flame . newline newline i ran beyond the crowd to where i d put my sword and shield . thank god for my paranoia it s what kept me alive . i looked at them as they took to the sky forming an attack formation . i whistled loudly telling sir manod and sir bronn to come out of their hiding places . i raised my shield as we formed a wall . by the end of the day we d have four funerals and a wedding . newline newline  newline read more over at rpagefighterthe rain was flogging down again . it has been raining for the past three days , so it was nt really a surprise , but klaus had almost hoped for today of all days to be a sunny one . it would have been refreshing to taste a piece of irony , it would have brought a slice of character to the otherwise unremarkable week . you could barely see brandenburg gate from here , he mused , and you could not distinguish the flags , gone grey in the shadow of the rain , contorting violently in the gale . the whole place had gone downhill since the kaiser had come to power , many years ago . it was too industrialised and formulaic , not nearly enough character . but , he conceded , the beer and food was fantastic . newline newline death was seated at a wireframe table , sat under a plastic covering at a tourist trap caf . there were nt any tourists in the pouring rain , of course , so they were almost alone , as per usual . death looked up from his phone when klaus sat down , and gave him a smile . klaus made a point of not returning it . newline newline  klaus , dude , long time , no see ! how ve you been , man ?  death slapped his hand on klaus  shoulder , full of energy as usual . he pronounced his name like  claws  again , and that always rubbed him the wrong way . newline  terrible  he retorted pointedly , refusing to meet his gaze . newline newline  oh do nt be like that ! i get to see you , what , once a year , and it s always guilt street , miseryville with you . lighten up for once in your life !  newline newline klaus ignored him , instead looking at the ridiculous getup death was wearing today . he was sporting a pair of blue levi s , the mind that are purposefully torn at the knees for whatever reason , like having shoddy clothes with a price tag of several hundred euros is some kind of fashion statement . he also wore one of those jerseys with ambiguous numbers on the back , trying to emulate some kind of sports jersey  feel , but being purposefully vague so that the person wearing it did nt actually have to play a sport or care about one . to cap it off  literally  , he wore a bright green beanie , covering up the messy blond hair he d given himself . newline newline death was still talking , of course , and klaus decided he might as well tune in again   ... and i m telling you , you really ought to get yourself outta this dreary city . why do nt you come visit me in san fran once in a while ? i can organise the flights and everything , give yourself a break for once , man . we really should hang out , more .  newline newline  i do nt want to hang out with you !  klaus snapped , looking away . newline newline there was about a minute of silence , and death looked hurt . newline newline  come on , man , do nt be like that , today s a special day , after all ! it s your bicentenary !  newline newline  my what ?  klaus asked acidly . newline newline  it s your twohundredth anniversary of immortality !  newline newline  and how in god s name is that supposed to make me feel better ?  newline newline death looked uncomfortable   well , i dunno , dude , i thought we could celebrate , i was gon na shout you a couple brewskies  newline newline  what on earth is a brewsky ?  klaus asked incredulously . newline newline  well , it s what us americans call  newline newline klaus slammed his fist on the table ,  actually , i do nt care . i m sick of your fake yankee accent and your designer jeans and your smarmy little smile . you call me every second day , and every time it s always the same pretentious garbage . you re despicable , death . you are legitimately the most unlikable individual i ve ever met , and you just sit there pretending you did nt condemn me to an eternity of pain !  newline newline death s mouth hung open for a second , shocked , then he frowned , clearly ticked off :  now you listen here you russian  newline newline  i m prussian , not russian , you ignorant git  klaus interrupted him . newline newline  same difference , who cares ?  death rolled his eyes ,  i did nt gift you immortality to be treated like this . you should be thanking me . if it was nt for me , you d be dead , but instead , i freed you to do whatever you wanted , forever ! we could have torn up the town together ! but you just moped around and only ever let me see you annually , and whenever we do it s this same negativity , and ... argh !  death could nt think of what to say , and instead folded his arms . newline newline  i was forced to watch all of my family and friends die  klaus deadpanned , stressing the point . newline newline  yeah you re welcome ! if i had just let the french shoot you dead , you d never have been able to see them , period ! they got to die peacefully , and happy ! you think they d have been happier if you d been snuffed out in austerlitz ?  newline newline klaus did nt say anything . newline newline  at least you had friends and family to begin with  death continued ,  i ve been around for thousands of years , and my job has always been going around snuffing out any stubborn souls , all of whom would kill to get what i gave you for free . the chinese emperor , qin shi huang , went insane trying to become immortal , and he put up quite the fight when i finally came for him , so be grateful for what you have !  newline newline they were both silent for a time , and the only sound was the deafening rain bucketing down over the cityscape . newline newline  do you want to know why i helped you ?  death asked , after a time . newline newline  why ?  klaus conceded , sighing . newline newline  thousands of years of doing my job is nt fun . i was depressed , hopeless , much like you are , now , but it s not like i could kill myself . death ca nt die , that does nt make any sense ! i helped you because i wanted someone who understood the kind of life i led , a companion to make me feel happier . i wanted a friend . but you just left . and then i had to go through two centuries of torture . the 19th and 20th centuries full of horrible wars , and ever larger groups of terrified men , women and children , killed for no good reason , i had to listed to their sons , their screams and their pleading . they died for nothing , but it was my job to carry out their deaths . i m not heartless , but it broke my heart , anyway . i needed a friend , and where were you ?  newline newline death rubbed his eyes , and klaus just now realised that death had been crying . newline newline  and then ... it ended . people stopped killing each other , and medicine improved , wars ended . i hardly ever have to deal people away from the mortal coil , kicking and screaming . life is good and the future is better !  he smiled , and klaus could nt help but smile too .  all i ever wanted to do was to have fun and forget all the crap that went down , but every year you ruin it for me .  newline newline they sat for about ten minutes more , and then the hour agreed upon for their meeting ended . death sighed , standing up and pulling the beanie tighter over his scalp to protect from the rain . he turned to go .  death  klaus stopped him ,  what say i meet you in san francisco , a week from now ?  newline newline death smiled ,  sounds good to me , dude the room was stale , seemingly unused for quite a while . the tables and chairs were covered in dust and the paint on the walls was chipping away , many areas littered with air pockets struggling to break free from their paper thin confines . nothing moved until a commotion started above it . yells muffled by the drywall could be heard upstairs before the loud bursts of gunfire sounded off . in response , a sound that could only be described as a shimmer echoed before a startling crack raced after it . the rattling of some sort of gun could be heard before someone blurted out a halfobscenity . then , a light crunch played out , whimsically , ecstatically bouncing off the walls above , causing a many grunts and startled yells of pain . newline newline after the short back and forth of gunfire and the other nature d sounds that played out above the room , the door within it slammed open . a man in blueish gray robes shuffled into the room , holding the door open .  get in here you two ! hurry !  the raspy , gruff voice shouted . as the previous gunfire seemed to continue in an almost continuous streak , another man approached the door . newline newline he backed in , firing off his silver pistol into the room he previously occupied . his head served as a shelf for his haphazardly placed bowler cap while the oddly stocky limbs attached to his body let a black threepiece suit hang upon them .  screw off , you crazy palookas !  he snarled before backing up a step too far , sending him tumbling down the stairs that lead further into the dusty , old room .  ack ! why did nt ya warn me about them stairs , slandin ?  he called up to the robed one as he sat up , his vowels distorting as if one was pinching his wide nostrils together . newline newline paying him no mind , slandin ducked into the room to dodge a stray bullet for a moment before shouting ,  get in here , tinks , you daft fool !  without another moments notice , a short , hair covered person flung himself into the room , using the top of the door frame to swing in . clumsily landing on the man who just fell down the stairs , tinks said ,  oh , sorry lenny .  lenny pushed him off and cried ,  urgh , get off you me ya damn chimp !  tinks yelped as he was pushed off of him and onto another part of the floor . raising himself up with his long , thin and quite prehensile tail , tinks said ,  relax , no need to get grumpy ole sourpuss .  newline newline as lenny got up off the floor , he looked over tinks , noting the numerous holes that went straight through his body . none of them produced any blood and , upon further inspection , the insides of the hole seemed to just replicate the look and feel of whatever part had been punctured . it was like tinks was a spry , lifegiven piece of clay , his wounds looking as if someone just took out a piece from his torso without much of a hassle . rolling his eyes , lenny muttered ,  stupid toons ,  as he turned back to slandin .  how s the door coming , magic man ? i just ran out of rounds for my pistol and my tommy gun ran out a couple of minutes ago ,  lenny asked in an annoyed tone , wiggling his empty guns to emphasize his point . newline newline as all of this was going on , slandin had pulled out an off gray , oak stick . the seemingly ordinary stick had been emitting various colors of light and sparks for several moments . its trail of neon colors marked the door as the wizard quickly moved his stick across it . once some unknown , mystic symbol had been scrawled on the door , the rest of it shimmered in a transparent , multicolored spectrum .  patience , leonard . this type of work ca nt be done as fast as you can pull a trigger ,  the grizzled voice projected from the cloak . pulling down his hood , slandin revealed his white , wrinkled face . it was mostly pale with some red remaining in his cheeks , probably brought about from the previous hours of tension .  and i ll have you know that i am not some magic man  from where you come from . i m a magister . we ve been over this , get it right ... simpleton .  he paused before puffing out the quick insult . newline newline  we also went over the plan , but you two could nt seem to get that right either ! you got yer part wrong and you were lollygagging , not paying attention ! know ya onions you dang jokes !  lenny pointed to slandin and tinks respectively as he said this . newline newline tinks scratched his head as he hopped off of his tail , which he had been currently using as a raised seat , before chiming in ,  why did we have to know about onions for this , len ? besides , i hate onions ! they leave a nasty taste in my mouth .  looking over at the chimp , lenny s face grew red as he pulled back his fist and exclaimed ,  its a figure of speech , you dolt !  lenny rammed his fat fist into the side of tinks  face , causing it to spin all the way around several times , as if it was on a rotating wheel .  ow , geez !  the monkey whined as he held his hand up to the red mark on his face . newline newline  leonard , no need for violence ! we may not have prepared much , but do nt act like you did nt have a part in it as well . eyeing over those women on the streets like a savage , instead of keeping an eye out like you were supposed to . my word !  slandin scolded lenny while he pocketed his wand into his sleeve . newline newline  from what we ve gone through in the past couple of days , there is plenty of need for violence . and fine , i might have been a little distracted , but at least i did nt screw up my whole damn part of the job !  the stocky man complained , his voice drawing out the vowels in his words .  what s done is done . we ca nt go back , and there is only room to go forward ,  slandin retorted before looking at the cheery , ecstatic monkey , the primate contorting and stretching himself to inhuman , cartoonish lengths out of boredom .  tinks , the time ?  newline newline  oh , uhm sure !  the small chimp clearly called out . he reached behind his back back , pulling out a hammer almost twice his size from thin air . the chimp was able to easily hold it , but he looked at it in confusion .  no , not that ,  he said to himself before putting it back from wherever it came from and rummaging to get another item . pulling out a banana peel , he sighed and put it back .  surprise surprise , the monkey brought along a banana snack ,  lenny chuckled as tinks rummaged some more . newline newline after a couple of moments of searching , lenny sighed and groaned ,  what s taking so long , furball ? if its so easy to get stuff lost wherever he s keeping that crap , why did we bother to let him have the translocator watch in the first place ?  rolling his eyes , slandin explained ,  while i d agree with you for once , we gave it to him because he would nt be able to lose it , unless of course he forgot where it was in there . its sort of hard for someone to drop something or be pickpocketed from an invisible holding place .   well it looks like he forgot ,  lenny finished . newline newline a moment later , the door produced a booming thud . the trio looked at it , noticing the magic slandin had put on it was starting to slowly dissipate .  come on , tinks !  slandin encouraged him in an agitated voice . several moments later , tinks had found the black circle he was looking for .  ah , okay . its about 6:45 ,  he told them before pocketing it again .  what ? he should have been here by  newline newline slandin was interrupted as the three of them fell down . a blue portal suddenly opened up under them and , once they were all through it , it closed as fast as it had appeared . they hurtled through the strange blue pathway for a short time until they were engulfed in a white light and tossed sideways onto a green field . they all landed awkwardly next to each other , lenny slightly toppled over slandin and tinks having fallen onto lenny s back . before the other two could look up , tinks exclaimed  grath !  and hopped off lenny . the magister and the dressed up thug groaned as they stood up , dusting themselves off . newline newline  took you long enough , grath . we were almost dead meat down there ,  lenny complained to the man as he looked him over . grath was young man , maybe in his upper20 s , who wore a bright orange shirt and had a black , shining pants . despite the chrome and blue lines that glowed in intricate patterns across his clothes , they looked fairly normal . in his hand , he held a black and blue pistol that looked as if it was powering down .  it did nt take you three long to mess up the plan , now did it ?  he holstered his futuristic pistol and scoffed ,  idiots ...  as he turned his back to them for a moment to look at their surroundings . sighing , he turned back to them and said ,  however , now that they know what we ve been trying to do , we do nt have much time to waste . we have to make another plan and get back to daleto , or else they ll win , got it ? now come on , we have to find someplace to recharge my portal gun ,  he informed them as he patted his holstered gun before simply turning away from them and walking off , expecting them to follow him shortly . newline newline the trio started to follow grath and tinks stated ,  well , looks like we ve got to find another way to save the world , huh ?  newline newline lenny replied ,  no , chimp . we re saving the universe .  newline newline sighing , slandin explained ,  gentlemen , we re saving all the universes .  newline newline grath yelled ,  shut up !  back to the only failures left that he could find to help save everything .dr. kent slipped a pill in a coffee and offered it to jennifer . newline newline  so how long it has been ?  he asked . newline newline  about a week . i do nt know it was damaged . i think maybe they give me a faulty one .  said jennifer while sipping the coffee . newline newline   newline jennifer knew something was wrong . she could nt explain what changed everyone . maybe i ve gone crazy , or maybe it s the world ?  she thought before she could nt take it anymore and decided to see the doctor . newline newline   newline newline she started feeling dizzy . dr. kent s pills started working . jennifer took no time to understand what was happening . newline newline  i trusted you and you did this ?  she said with disappointment in her voice . newline newline  look jennifer , it s all going to be all right . your mask is not working for how long i do nt know and you know the new law right ?  he said with a grin on his face . newline newline  that law is ridiculous . do nt you see how people are killing each other since the day these masks came  she said while trying to sit balanced in the chair . she took out a gun from her purse and pointed towards the doctor . newline newline  they ll put in a asylum . they ll kill me . you said you wo nt tell anyone .  and a shot fired from the gun at doctors face . newline newline he fell down from his chair . stumbling across the room jennifer walked out , closed her eyes and gave herself up to the unconsciousness . the gun slipped from her hand as she fell on the floor . newline newline   newline newline helen was in her chair looking over the appointments when she heard the gunshot . she hid down below her desk and called police . she heard the door open and someone collapsing . she took a peak and saw a woman lying on the floor with a gun inches from her . newline newline it took all her courage to rush and kick the gun away from her . she heard the doctor squealing in pain from inside the office . she went inside and saw him lying on the floor . newline newline  are you ok ?  newline newline  yeah i m alright . the bullet just grazed the mask a little bit . did you call the police ? that woman has been using a faulty mask , she must go away .  newline newline   newline newline jennifer was taken by the emergency services into a private government facility . newline newline dr. kent went home early . he started experiencing the same thing jennifer earlier told him . did i made a mistake ? or am i going crazy ?  he sweated . he then realized there was a leak in his mask . newline newline   newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinehere s one of my earlier works . asteroid impact . i think they re fun , but these days they re considered the michael bay of apocalypses . all you have to do is move a goodsized rock into position and watch the fireworks . but i like them , no matter what the critics say . people should appreciate the simple pleasures . newline newline here s a more complicated project : nuclear warfare . first , you ve got to put enough uranium on the planet s surface in easily mineable veins . i usually hire a geology expert to make sure it looks natural . once a species discovers it , they can usually work out the nuclear physics on their own . they ll get an atomic bomb in a century , maybe less if there s a war on . newline newline the real trouble is getting them to use it . it s really easy for a cold war to develop where everyone threatens to use the bomb and nobody actually does . boring ! sure , you could beam down and break the stalemate yourself , but that s breaking the fourth wall . unprofessional as hell . newline newline so you have to set up something in advance . i like wars over resources  you d be amazed how hard they fight for highenergy petrochemicals . but you can also just raise the oxygen content a little bit  the bomb will literally light the atmosphere on fire . pretty cool , huh ? newline newline but like the asteroids , nukes are getting pass . and i do nt have the budget to do a stellar collision or a supernova like the bigname studios are doing . so my latest entry is going to be a bit more avantgarde : time . newline newline think about it . all you have to do is put life near a mainsequence star and wait . eventually it moves into the red giant phase , and the planet gets consumed by fire and reduced to a lump of molten iron . looks beautiful , and all you have to do is make sure they do nt leave the solar system . that s dead easy compared to arranging global nuclear war . they practically do the work for you ! i mean , what species in their right minds would launch themselves into the void of space with no end goal in mind just to spite destiny for a few more years ? newline newline oh , do nt you bring up the generation ships again . jeez , i produced one flop , i let one measly civilization put together an orion drive , and nobody ever lets me forget it !i cut the head off of the chicken with a large axe . the crowd gasped . and , sure enough , the chicken began to run around the stage . it ran for a good 15 minutes , making spirals , loops , and zigzags finally , with a vomitinducing crunch , it smacked into a wall and fell off of it s feet . it twitched for a moment , then throbbed for another , and then finally lay still . at first , penn had been smirking at my cheap  trick  . now , the look on his face was uneasy . he whispered into teller s ear , and then turned to speak up . newline newline i interrupted .  but mr. penn ,  i jauntily called out .  i m not done !  i was practically singing . newline newline i walked forwards .  i m going to need a volunteer !  i put my long , slender hand on teller s shoulder .  whadda ya say ?  newline newline he shifted in his seat , mumbling something unintelligible .  what was that ?  i responded to the crowd .  nothing ? very well then .  i coaxed him out of the seat and onto the stage . now for some real magic .  newline newline he looked at me uneasily . i smiled , clasping his hands between mine .  do nt be scared ,  i whispered to him .  you re gon na look great up here . and you ve got some strong legs .  my eyes were glowing a cold bright white as i peered into that week , feeble man . newline newline as he turned towards penn in fear , i brandished my axe .as i moved up the hill to my house , i knew in that way that can only be explained by the fact that i was in a dream . i walked down into the yard , through the front door , and i just knew that they were gone . i wasn  t sure of what had happened , but i knew that they were all gone . it had that sort of lingering sad feeling to it , that would look like twilight if it were a time of day . it might have been twilight in the dream . i don  t remember much of how it happened , or what happened afterwards . i just remember being there , and knowing , and feeling the finality of it . it was funny , because i never really considered us to be close . but that  s what made it sad in the way that it was , because i never tried as much as i should have or could have , and i never had the chance to say goodbye or apologize and explain myself . it was a simple and profound feeling of utterly resigned sadness . i knew , deep inside of me , that it was over , and that there was nothing left for me . how was your first day of school ?  newline newline damian and joshua exchanged glances , then grinned boyishly back at their mother . newline newline  it was great ,  joshua said cheerily .  the other kids were really nice . i made a lot of new friends today !  newline newline  yeah , i think he might be the most popular kid in the class !  damian chimed in .  i m not , but that s okay  i m just happy the other kids do nt pick on me . and i learned some new things too !  newline newline  course they do nt pick on you ,  joshua replied before their mother could interject .  they know you re my brother .  newline newline  yeah , you re right ,  damian said with a shrewd nod . newline newline    newline newline  are you sure you re alright ?  newline newline  it does nt hurt that much anymore , mom ,  damian assured her , suppressing a sniffle .  sides , you should have seen what happened to them .  newline newline  really ?  she pressed .  what happened to them ?  newline newline joshua and damian looked at one another , briefly panicking as they contemplated how to answer their mother s question . newline newline  we do nt want to talk about it ,  joshua whispered at last . newline newline  yeah ,  damian agreed slyly .  josh stood up for me today , and that s what matters .  newline newline joshua gave his brother a doting smile . newline newline    newline newline  i mean it ,  joshua repeated , bewildered .  that s amazing .  newline newline  it s not that amazing ...  damian shrugged . newline newline  what s amazing ?  newline newline  mom , mom !  joshua exclaimed .  you know that one kid who used to pick on damian all the time ? the two of them are friends now !  newline newline damian turned away , smiling roguishly , as their mother cheered in congratulations . newline newline  last week , the teacher taught us about putting ourselves in other people s shoes ,  he explained meekly ,  so i talked to him , he talked to me , and yeah ...  newline newline  that s really cool , though ,  joshua assured his brother .  if it were me , i d have just ... yknow ...  newline newline  yeah , but you do nt know what he s been through . he told me that his parents would ... no , i probably should nt tell you guys that . anyway , what are you gushing at me for ? you re the coolest kid in the class  everybody says so !  newline newline it took their mother several minutes to stop the ensuing argument over which of the two brothers was cooler  neither wished to stop idolizing the other . newline newline    newline newline  so how are your friends doing ?  newline newline damian furtively glanced at his feet , collecting his thoughts , while joshua contemplatively turned his gaze to the side . newline newline  actually , i made a new friend today ,  damian announced .  the other kids said she was bad news , but i did nt think so .  newline newline  yeah , i saw you two talking earlier ,  joshua noted .  so she s the newest member of your posse , huh ?  newline newline  i guess so .  newline newline  speaking of which ,  their mother interrupted ,  the two boys who tried to steal other students  lunch money have nt been up to anything since then , have they ?  newline newline  not since i invited them to play , no ,  damian replied . newline newline  it s really neat how well he gets along with troublemakers ,  joshua mused aloud .  it s like he brings out the best in them . he s a really good leader , yknow ?  newline newline  you are too ,  damian assured his brother , embarrassed . newline newline  well , what about you , joshua ?  their mother inquired .  how have you been getting along with your friends ?  newline newline  great ,  joshua answered .  my best friends and i been playing a new game at recess that i think is really fun .  newline newline damian twitched uncomfortably , but said nothing as joshua explained the rules . newline newline  it s kinda like a cross between tag , hide and seek , and the floor is lava . so basically , the four of them are my helpers , who ride  er , run  around the playground , and ... it is an odd thing to hear the voices of an object . newline the utterances can not be replayed by any human tongue . newline understanding is not lost , but explanation is unreachable . newline so it is with this very story , for i am merely a cup . newline newline her form was unique , far from perfect and yet perfectly acceptable . newline the hair was fair , and taught . newline exquisite was the word i would use for her hands . newline this woman was perfectly adequate , i would say . newline newline she was not simply sad . she was angry . she was mad . newline i began joviantly proclamating my sounds and she responded in kind . newline well she sort of  humphred  actually , a low visceral grunt . newline i showed her many wonderful things , in the voices of my former bearers . newline newline to see her eyes swell was enough to make me shake , enough to make me ready . newline forget the hall , forget the tools of men , she would wield the greatest threat of all . newline a cup full of poison , for the fools who would drink me , and all are fools before me . newline i am sad though , for she used me valiantly , and then drank from me herself .the tour guide looked insulted but my frat bros just laughed . i threw a dip in my mouth and spilt from the group . as i stumbled around i quickly became disoriented and wound up in long hall filled with suits of armor . newline newline at the end of the line i spotted the freshest medieval gear i had ever seen . i honestly think the bro had metal boat shoes and an izod logo on his chest . i was pretty drunk though so maybe not . newline newline then i saw the plaque above his armor . sir thad the dong windlow .  the dong , fucking epic !  i said as i noticed one last piece of the majestic throne to the dong . newline newline every knight had a special item next to their armor . most were pretty lame like flutes , crosses , and kerchiefs . the dong was special though , this bro had a solid gold chamber pot that you just know doubled as a spitter  no natty ice cans back in the day !  i said in my mind . newline newline to show my honor to the dong i whipped mine out and took a piss . as the first drop hit the gold the world began to spin and warp , growing massive and shrinking at the same time . tripping balls would be considered an under statement . when the trip stop i was in the same hall but it looked vastly different . newline newline i then felt a metal fist grab the back of my neck . i turn to see a knight stand tall above me . his visor flips up and i see oakley glass under neath . newline newline  bro ! bro ? did you fucking piss in my pot ? bro ? are we eskimo bros ? please tell me you have some fucking skol ... wench ! come meet my new bro wench ! there was once a prince of the land . he was loyal to the king , loved by the citizens , and adored by princesses the world around . he was just , fair , and spoke with an air of confidence to draw even the most independent of ears . the prince did nt need to be told this , but was consistently told by all around him . everyone hung on his every word as he spoke . newline newline on one occasion , the prince came into the square to speak to his public . people stopped their daily affairs and gathered around the pedestal the prince instructed his knights to set up . he said that he was not their leader . he said that he was no better than any man . he said that if they truly thought he should be as great as they said there should be a contest . a contest of physical beauty , strength , stamina , and intellectual capacity . newline newline and so , there was a great festival . princes and people came from all around to compete for the title of  best man  . the judges had been especially picked for their fairness and were comprised of all princesses . it was quite a spectacle and the prince required the building of a large arena complex . newline newline on the day of the event , the prince stood out far in front the other contestants . hours of trials passed and there remained only 5 people left . each had his own distinct merits . a doctor from the prince s land , a tradesman from the mainland , a logger from the north , a knight from the prince s palace , and lastly our prince . newline newline each man had his own merits and each particularly stood out for their own individuality . the final decision was incredibly tough and the judges were locked in a heated argument which showed no signs of settling . the prince spoke and a hush grew over the audience as everyone listened . newline newline the prince went on to declare his victory over his opponents . since he created the contest , he had also declared the rules of the contest . one rule which no one had known about was that the first person to declare themselves the winner , would be the winner . the people stood in awe . the other contestants shouted and cursed the prince . the prince laughed at them and ordered them to be taken away . newline newline the guards , the audience , and the contestants all laughed loudly at the prince . the hysterical laughter threw the prince into a frenzy shouting at them . no one had seen the prince shout before this day . the guards immediately seized the other contestants and ushered the startled and confused fans out of the arena . newline newline his murderous , tyrannical reign lasted until his death .let me tell you about jack ... he s the luckiest guy i know ! newline newline he s always finding money on the floor or winning promotions , lotteries , and raffles . newline newline he has slept with more women than i ve ever known . newline newline i only know jack because i live on his couch , we met one night at the casino , i was drunk and ended up losing all my winning , jack meanwhile cleaned up house . newline he felt sorry for me and offered his couch for me to sleep on . newline newline i was supposed to get on a flight for an interview the next morning at an up and coming tech startup but it was canceled and the hotel had made a mistake with my room , so i had nowhere to stay . newline newline jack felt bad for me and i crashed at his place . newline newline my life kinda went to shit after that , i found out my girlfriend had been cheating on me , and we broke up . newline newline since i was staying at

that jack likes me and takes care of me . newline mary.  newline newline  mary of nazareth , mother of the christ child . i am gabriel , messenger of the lord and i bid thee hear me.  newline newline it was cold , cold enough for her breath to form tiny clouds when she exhaled . mary pushed aside the furs and carefully climbed out of bed , watching her husband the entire time . he didn  t stir in the slightest , and she was not surprised . she reached over , started to stroke a bit of his hair off his forehead , then quickly withdrew her hand and headed outside . newline newline gabriel was brilliant , shining , and she held up that same hand to block the light from her eyes . his light did nothing to warm her . newline newline  must you blind me so ?  newline newline  i am as i am , and always shall be . unto you a child is born.  newline newline  yes , i know . god has blessed me with this child , and with a patient and understanding man for a husband.  she pressed her lips together , lowered her hand , and looked back towards her home .  i am not always certain he believes . he tries , andi just see it sometimes when he looks at me.  newline newline  his belief matters not . you are chosen to bear the child of god.  newline newline  yes , and i have born him . i shall love him , and raise him , and protect and teach him as best i am able . he will be a great man among men , and  newline newline  not the christ . his path is laid before him and can not be altered . unto you , a daughter is born.  newline newline  what ?  she turned back to look at the angel , squinting at his brightness , trying to see more than just his radiance .  a daughter ?  newline newline  the only daughter of god is born unto you.  she pressed her hand against her stomach . newline newline  a daughter . of god . for what purpose ?  newline newline  because you are bidden.  newline newline  and what of joseph ? when shall i have the chance to bear his children ?  newline newline  you shall not.  newline newline  why not ?  newline newline  because you are bidden.  newline newline she brought one of her hands from her stomach to her face , stifling a sob . she shut her eyes tightly , but twin tears slid out from between her eyelids and traced their way down her cheeks . the angel glowed . she swallowed down her sorrow . newline newline  what is her name ?  newline newline  lillith.  newline newline the angel  s brilliance vanished , and mary stood alone out in the dark and the cold . she shivered , then shuddered and fell to her knees before emptying her stomach of bile and grief . she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand , swiped some dirt over the mess , and went back inside . just as carefully as before , she got back into bed . joseph turned over , tucked her under his arm , and sleepily murmured ,  go back to sleep.  mary shut her eyes , and did as she was bidden . newlineit was supposed to be a joke . newline newline he never expected it to have turned out like this . little danny , with his green eyes and dimpled cheeks and sun kissed freckles , was all smiles and laughter . he was so alive and joyous , everyone loved him . newline newline how was he supposed to know about the beatings , the screamings , the rejection ? newline newline it was nt until recently that the homophobic abuse danny suffered from his parents came into light , and by then it was no use . newline newline he was nt the only one who pushed the boy into the lockers . he was nt the only one who went out of his way to call him a fag . newline newline he did nt even know he was gay , honestly . newline newline it was really all just a joke ! he was like this with everyone ! besides , no one ever asked him how he felt . no one ever bothered to even question why an intelligent boy like zack would ever taunt the other boy . no one bothered to even question why zack had taken to paying so much attention to the spitfire in the first place . newline newline so as zack stared at the body on the pavement below , too shaken have to even stop the other teen from launching himself off of the seven story school building , he held his lips , still tingling from the gentle kiss of the other senior and thought maybe , just maybe , they were nt so different after all . newline newline slowly he began to let go of the railing as well .pls do nt be mad mr . neruda

surface . newline against better judgement , he gazed down . newline a drop of thousands of feet stared back at him . newline he peeled his tired eyes away and settled them on the chipper young man climbing below him ,  you hanging in there , arthur ?  newline a particularly aggressive burst of wind brought the conversation to a standstill , the climbers pressed themselves against the mountainside . despite their situation , the young man was all smiles , brimming with vitality . newline recruited from a small town , the boy fit the hero  s description of the prophecy to an unsettling degree . newline saying he was born for it would be an understatement . newline in fact , he fit the bill to star in several other prophecies . newline turns out the people that make up prophecies aren  t very creative , they all wanted a tall heroic figure with dashing good looks , and an almost depressing ability to succeed at everything that person attempted . newline not so much depressing for that person himself , but rather for everyone else forced to interact with him . newline bernard had decided to keep quiet about all the other prophecies , lest the boy should suddenly sprout aspirations to become something like the world  s greatest baker . newline  and probably succeed at it too ,  grumbled bernard . newline young arthur naturally excelled at everything he attempted , much to the annoyance of the various masters travelling alongside him . newline they felt themselves slip from their  mentor  role at a frightening pace , and hated him for it . newline the wizard had even gone as far as hiding his spell tomes , as arthur had developed a habit of mastering spells overnight . newline naturally , most mentors had cut their teachings short or were deliberately vague . newline   stick em with the pointy end ,   the swordsman would explain . newline  just wave your hands around and yell fireball  a lot ,   the wizard would say . newline but bernard was at an age where he couldn  t afford to be selfish , and continued to personally educate young arthur on everything a strapping young hero should know . newline arthur tucked a strand of blond hair behind a pointy ear ,  never felt better ,  he smiled . newline he was , of course , an halfelf . newline bernard rolled his eyes , something told him this young man would in some inexplicable way or another resolve the 300year old feud between the two races , and bring peace to this wartorn land . newline he warmed himself with thoughts of someday watching arthur marry some elvish princess , and in doing so , unite the realm . newline he  d stand amongst the crowd gathered in the pristine white palace , arthur would call him out and inform the crowd of the perilous journey they had taken together , the foes they defeated and their camaraderie . newline the wizard climbing below arthur began to shout , using one hand to hold his pointy hat ,  hurry it up , my hands are freezing !  newline bernard snapped out of his fantasies and moved his hand with renewed determination towards the next handhold , it snapped off . newline the rock tumbled down and hit young arthur square in the face . newline the entire party meekly watched as the herotobe dropped down the mountain . newline then their heads turned towards bernard . newline  well , damn .  newline newline the wizard stared at him with frantic eyes ,  did you just  . newline  not on purpose ,  said bernard hastily ,  let  s go back down , he might still be alive.  newline hanging from a handhold below the wizard , the ranger squinted her eyes ,  i think he  s moving , yeah , he  s standing.  newline bernard smiled in relief ,  really ?  newline a large bird swooped down and slammed into arthur with enough force to crack castle walls . newline the wizard casually pulled a pair of glasses from the inside of his robe ,  a grand northern eagle , talons like centuryold ice , beak like tempered steel ,  he said , taking off the glasses and tucking them back into his robe ,  he  s done for.  newline a tiny figure swayed back and forth , avoiding the talons the eagle thrust at him . newline there was an piercing squawk , the eagle slammed into the ground beside the tiny figure . newline the tiny figure screamed its victory cry , sword held high . newline the mountain rumbled , snow began to shift ,  hang on !  the ranger cried . newline the party clung desperately to the mountain as the avalanche passed overhead , the tiny figure was swept away . newline bernard watched with fearful eyes ,  hold on , he might be alive.  newline a gorgeous head of blond hair popped out of the snow . newline  wow , look at that ,  said the ranger in amazement ,  he  s alive.  newline bernard foot scratched against the mountain , looking for a foothold ,  we quickly need to go down and   newline arthur disappeared back into the snow , large wormlike creatures circled around where his head had been . newline the wizard chuckled ,  snow jormunds , they allow themselves to be swept away by an avalanche and feed on whatever is trapped in the snow.  newline the snow turned crimson , the worms left molelike trails in the snow as they left , searching for their next meal . newline  he might be alive ,  proclaimed bernard with a tremble in his voice . newline the ranger raised an eyebrow ,  feel free to go check.  wait ... what ? .. sigh i thought they checked all the equipment before departure  i exclaimed newline newline  time expedition 001  log 26  scanners are picking up

observation post to see what might be generating the signal . newline newline  it should be right here !  i exclaim , as i wonder around the immense field of corn searching for the source of the signal  newline newline suddenly , i collide with some invisible force in front of me , sending me falling backwards to the ground . newline newline as i get back up i notice a slight shimmer doing the same thing . newline newline  i was wondering if that would work or not !  a familiar voice says , shocking the hell out of me . it ... it was my voice . newline newline  listen , i know this is all confusing , but ironically , we do nt have much time to explain , especially explain something to.. myself ... yeah its confusing to me too , anyway we need to get back to your time machine before things get weird around here  my..  self ?  says to me . newline newline without another word he grabs me by the hand and leads me back toward the forest where i had originally landed ... if i only knew what was in store for us next .newline the already small and grey apartment feels even smaller when seen from another perspective . it must have been months ago since i picked up the morning mail that know had formed into a small mountain by the door in the hallway .  electric bill , internet bill , telephone bill ...  it almost felt like i had accomplished something by just looking at these mails and bills . each letter felt like a mountain stage , but i was determined to make it to the top . villain news only makes me question my own existence these days . i remember when i enjoyed that magazine , but those days are long gone i guess . newline newline i throw the last magazine in the trash can but i miss it . the fat screaming headline letters reveals  newline  breaking news  newline  captain mainstreamop has done it again !   newline newline the headline hits me hard . like an avalanche that drags me all the way down to the bottom . there was i time when i made the front page , not a stupid  superhero  . in frustration and anger i kick the pile of what s left of the mail and a big brown package bounces down the hallway and ends up in the kitchen floor . it is distinctly marked with the letter  m  . without thinking i tear the wrapping open . it s a shoebox with a note . newline  to dr. lurk , from a dear enemy . today is your day .  carpe diem  newline newline the quote made me shudder in disgust . there could only be one person in this town who would write something mainstream as that . i ve almost forgot about the shoebox im holding in my hand . i slide the lid off slowly and i can see something bright red almost shining from the inside . the smell of a strong manly parfume leaks out in the kitchen as i open the box . i instantly realize what s inside , and i pull it out and fold it out on the kitchen table .  why ?  is the first question that comes to my head . why in the world would captain mainstreamop send his superhero suit to a simple villain like me ? i take the costume up and hold it up against my body . the soft fabric almost makes me want to try it , and yet again i question myself . am i real villain ? a real villain would not even live in an apartment , the ones i read about as a kid lived in caves and scary castles . i was just a shitty , soon to be homeless looser trying to make ends meet in bronx . i put the costume back in the box . i ll maybe burn it later or destroy it in some way . newline newline the radio is still on since yesterday and some down tempo house music is on . i decide to make myself some coffee and maybe , just maybe make something out of this day . while i look thru the dirty dishes for a coffee cup clean enough to drink out , a loud emergency message burst out thru the radio speakers  newline   dr . evil has taken 21 hostages as hes currently robbing a bank at downstreet 42 in bronx   newline newline i instantly freeze . dr . evil is my villain name . who would take an already taken name ? the glimpse of the red costume in the corner of my eye is distracting me while im trying to figure it out and suddenly the pieces falls together . i check my closet and my suit is gone . somehow captain m must have got in and stole my suit the past days , maybe when i was passed out drunk two days ago . newline newline   captain mainstreamop should have been here before the police came , where is he ? !   the radio keeps on covering live footage and i realize that this is what  m  wanted . he wants me to stop myself from digging this endless hole of misery . i have to put on that suit , get out there . maybe i ll find joy in being a superhero for a day , or appreciate being a villain when ive done this . i put on the red flashy suit and it fits like a glove to my slim body . i almost feel a bit special wearing it compared to wearing my villain suit . i take a few deep breaths and say try to figure out where to get to downstreet 42 the quickest way possible . i run down the stairway to my car . when i step outside the apartment complex i find myself in shock . anonboy , captain m s assistant opens the door to their famous vehicle . he says out loud  newline newline  we do nt have all the time in the world  m  .  dr. lurk  is a smart villain . he will always have an ace up his sleeve . i big smile fills my face and i reply  newline newline  he surely is anonboy , he surely is ... .. the figurative blank slate , is something every criminal has chased since the dawn of evil in this world . they have died looking for it and the ability to do as one pleases and without reprecussions . i was born with it . whereas my mother has the shadow of a cannibal , and of which quickly led to her arrest in the disappearance of our local neighbor . i have nothing , absolutely nothing to show others who i really am , the demon that lurks inside . newline newline in this world we live in we are bound by shadows , they define who we are without our say or our own personalities , not me .. i am free .we wandered down the city street , crossing an intersection after a few blocks . it was weird to see the drops of rain stay in the air . i still used the crosswalks . newline newline i knew something was off when we approached the coffee shop . someone was pressed up against a window . the grey cat stopped and looked between the man and me . there was a fight going on inside , and this man was being thrown through the window . newline newline if forcemassacceleration , and everything is frozen , then any movement on the part of me or the cat should seem to ... everything else , i guess , to have infinite acceleration , and therefore infinite force . however , we have nt had trouble walking around , or with the raindrops . i moved the man to the side , near the door , so he would nt fall through the glass . newline newline the cat looked at me again , and then kept walking . i followed him a long ways . newline newline eventually , at the edge of the city , we reached a row of houses , all painted faded pinks , yellows , blues , and greens . the wet grass around them looked weird , as did the highway with no movement . it was very quiet  i could nt even hear the cat . it led me to the small front garden of a light green house . it wanted me to open the door . it was nt locked . it took a little while to see it . there was a toddler pulling on a bookcase in the corner of a room , about to be hit by its weight . a woman , i assume the kid s mother , was eating in the room over , too far to help , probably unaware . i removed the toddler s bands from the shelf and righted the bookcase . it was strange without anything moving on it s own . it would be weird for the kid when he unfroze . newline newline would he unfreeze ? the cat jumped onto the bookcase i had just fixed , staring at me . maybe nothing was frozen , and it was just us that something was happening to . newline newline i wondered if this had happened before . i asked the cat . it jumped down and trotted out of the house , as if impatient . newline newline it stopped across the highway , at an open car , its owner making a call in the emergency lane . the cat jumped into shotgun . i glance between the man on the phone and the cat in the car . the cat seemed to know what it was doing , and where people needed help . i got in the car . newline newline somehow , it worked . we drove around slowly , maneuvering around stopped cars . the cat pawed at the window when we needed to turn or stop . we prevented three thefts and gave food to five homeless people . i felt like robin hood . i left postit notes from an abandoned stack under a table outside a caf . it was fun to write a note to those we fed , to apologize to the man stealing three packs of cigarettes and a swiss army knife . i felt like a meddling god , doing good and having fun . newline newline after what seemed like many hours  although it was hard to tell with the sun frozen in its latemorning position  , the cat stopped and looked at me . it seemed thankful . i guess it could nt do everything it needed to on its own , although it seemed more like a god . it was probably the cat who stopped time . newline newline then , suddenly , everything resumed . a man bumped into me , and the cat ran off . i started after it , while halfturning and mumbling an apology to the man whose way i had obstructed . he seemed startled . the cat was gone . newline newline i wonder if it does that a lot , maybe with more people , and the world never notices . then again , it would be welldocumented if people moved and food appeared in an instant . newline newline that had been a very interesting day . i smiled . newline newline   newline newline i m sorry this

infectious and inevitable ! and why not ? who knew what would happen when the great drop finally arrived ! newline newline but the revelry was dead because the music was stuck , hovering over that sweet relief from the ever pounding predrop . at first it seemed like it would come any second . that second lengthened into hours . into days . people actually went back to work , but she waited , poised to sync herself right into that magical moment when the bass , when the bass , when the bass transcendentally dropped ! newline newline they bought earplugs to fool themselves into thinking that only feeling it , not hearing it was enough . she waited , she waited . they convinced themselves that it was some great fluke of the universe . she persevered , she persevered . suicides were rampant across the globe , people flinging themselves into death to either escape those last ever pumping beats or in despair that their drop had been denied them . she stood poised , she stood poised to fall into it any moment . newline newline then one day she died . the last true believer , the only remaining dancer , finally dropped dead on her feet , so sure that any moment she would be lost in the mad glory of the drop . as her body hit the floor those same , driving tones sharply rose and then , unbelievably stopped . newline newline the world collectively looked up , pulled out their earplugs , spat out their once eternally rippling beverages , and stared wildly into the sky . newline newline out of that pause it came , like a wrathfully sublime sun slamming into their puny earth and the billions of them reveled or despaired . it had come to claim them at last . newline newline the drop . huh ,  i thought as i watched the gunshot wound seal itself . in a matter of seconds there was nt even a scar left . my assailant was equally dumbfounded . with the vigilante temporarily stunned from witnessing my newly manifested powers , i dashed outside . richard was waiting in the getaway car just outside in the handicap parking spot . newline newline  step on it !  i shouted at my partner before i even closed the door . the tires squealed on the asphalt and then we took off towards our hideout three blocks away .  dude , you ll never guess what just happened . look !  i lifted my tshirt and showed by chest to richard . newline newline  woah , you finally grew a chest hair ,  said richard . newline newline  no , dick ,  i said .  i got shot my some asshat in there . but look ! no bullet holes ! i healed myself .  richard just nodded and continued staring straight ahead at the road . i do nt think he believed me . i made a mental note to let him cut me with a knife later to prove it . newline newline our hideout was an old abandoned warehouse in the slums . i think it used to be a tire factory or something . anyways , it s been abandoned for decades . richard and i came across it about two months ago and decided that it was in a perfect location to be our secret lair . once we parked out the back , richard helped me lug the heavy money bags out of the car and into the warehouse . it was only 7pm , but it was already pretty dark inside already because of the dirty windows blocking any lights from the outside . i hit a switch on the wall to turn on the main lights . when my eyes adjusted to the bright lighting , i was startled to see three uninvited guests in the room with me and richard . newline newline  ach mein gott !  exclaimed a black figure . before i could make out any details , he vanished in a puff of smoke , leaving behind a godawful stench reminiscent of sulfur . newline newline  hey bub ,  said a short , angry man in yellow spandex as he stepped towards me .  put that gun away or i m gon na have to shove it up your  newline newline  logan , please ,  interrupted the bald man in a wheelchair as he placed a hand onto the previous man s arm , silencing him . the bald stranger then turned to me and looked me directly in the eye . unlike with the other 2 strangers , i did nt feel scared when i looked at this man . he then spoke to me in a calming voice .  good evening , ragatode . my name is professor charles xavier . the tall man escorted me silently down the long empty corridor . the florescent lights evenly illuminated the stark white walls periodically broken by the frame of a closed door . as we neared the end of he hallway , the dark haired , clean cut man stopped abruptly . newline newline  mr. brendon , your prize is right through this door . take your time making the final decision . once a choice is made , you ca nt change your mind .  with that , my escort stepped aside . newline newline the room provided no relief from the sterile decor of the rest of the building . the white walls , ceiling , and floor were devoid of any adornments or color with the exception of two platforms . the first platform was covered from edge to edge with neat stacks of crisp  100 bills , held together tightly with thin white paper bands . the other contained a small stainless steel box with no visible hinges or markings . i looked in awe of the large pile of money . i had never been this close to that kind of money in my life . as i took a few steps towards the platforms , i could smell the freshly printed bills . newline newline the cash was clearly the most logical choice . i was almost out of money after being out of work for the last 4 years . but as i looked at the money , i felt no joy , no excitement , no respite from my own personal torment . what would i do with all this money ? buy a larger box to waste away in ? try and find something to give my life meaning ? it seemed like a long shot at best . newline newline the small box sat modestly on it s platform . it s simple and ordinary nature made the rest of this place look almost extravagant . but for all of its mundane appearances , there was something alluring about it . i could nt imagine anything in such a small box being worth much , but that did nt seem to matter much . before i realized it , i was peering at the box from above , my feet resting at the base of the nearly empty platform . i took one last glance at the money sitting beside me . i would never have another opportunity like this again . what would everyone think of me for turning down that much wealth ? ... everyone ? who is everyone ? i had nt spoken to any friends in at least 2 years . my family was gone . the one person i had once truly cared about was dead . newline newline i picked up the box . it was heavier than i had anticipated . i still could nt find any hinges but as i pulled up on the top half of the box , the thin horizontal seam encircling the middle of the box began to widen . i could nt help but hold my breath as i pulled the top away to reveal my choice . a pale yellow pill sat in the middle of the miniature white pillow filling most the box . as i lifted the pill from the box , i hesitated . this could be anything . i turned my head to look back towards the door i entered through . it remained closed . somehow i doubted that the quiet gentleman who escorted me down here would know any more than i did . newline newline  well ... i m certainly not going to waste something that i paid  10 million for .  i tossed the pill towards the back of my throat and swallowed . i did nt feel any different . maybe it was just a sugar pill meant to teach people not to be greedy . i began to walk towards the door to be escorted back out . newline newline everything was black . that smell ... it was familiar , but what was it . i breathed deeper through my nostrils . the sweet fragrance made me feel at peace , like everything was right in the world . i recognized it , but could nt place it . why could nt i see ? i tried to move but my body was nt responding . newline newline  i must be dreaming .  newline newline i tried again to send signals to my muscles to move . finally it responded and i rolled over onto my back . as i laid there with my eyes still closed , my body s senses began to return . i felt the comfort of my own bed around me . but the smell did nt fade away with my dreams . i stopped , frozen by the realization of what that familiar fragrance was . i turned my head to the left and forced my eyes to open . her golden shining hair was strewn across the pillow next to mine . when i realized i had been holding my breath , i drew another one in . i again smelled the floral scent of her shampoo . newline newline was she real ? i sat up to get a better look . a smile grew across her face as she opened her eyes to look up into mine . that perfect smile that i d give anything to see . she brought her hand up from beneath the covers to wipe away the tears rolling down my cheek . newline newline i finally gathered my thoughts enough to speak .  is it really you ?  newline newline  that s a ... complicated answer . but for the most part yes .  newline newline  but how ?  newline newline she gave a small giggle .  that s another complicated one .  her smile lessened slightly .  you should know something though . this is only for one day . and it will never work again .  newline newline i fell onto her and buried my face in the covers . i could nt hold it in any longer and began to weep . newline newline  shhh , it s ok babe .  her soft fingers made their way through my hair comfortingly as she squeezed me close . newline newline  but i miss you so much .  newline newline  i know . but i m here now .  newline newline  you re right . i do nt want to waste another moment with you .  i sat back upright and wiped my tears away with the sheet . newline newline her smile was back .  how should we spend our day ? another mundane day goes by and i start to think of what to do at night . the business is nt going as stellar lately thanks to the tension between the empires . there has been news about the city patrol gone missing at nearby village . luckily nothing major happens so far . sometimes i wonder if i should have stayed behind the wall and do the business . while war means profit for some merchant , it is definitely not the case for a pawn shop like mine . newline newline the doorbell rings and interrupts my train of thought . i put on my usual business face until i realize who he is . newline newline  argh ! not you again colt .  i look at the warrior with disappointment . newline newline  it is good to see you . how is the business doing ?  newline newline  not bad , until you come in .  i raise my eyebrow when i see the big bag on colt s back ,  do nt tell me ...  newline newline  relax , this time i got something real nice for you . i am sure you will find them valuable .  colt puts his bag on the floor with all his strength ,  you know , at the time of war , staff like this is going to spike in price . soon enough you will be swimming in all the fortune and ...  newline newline  cut that , colt . you never learn , right ?  i step out of my counter and look at his bag , taking a sword out of it and examine it with one of my eyes closed . newline newline  ah ! that is the sword i found in the ruin a few days ago . some bandit took camp there . they said it is made by ...  newline newline  the master swordsmith ? yep , totally . all 87 of the swords in the bag are made by that master swordsmith . am i right ?  newline newline  how do you know that ? i never know you are an expert on the topic of sword .  colt s face is full of excitement . newline newline  and my 16 year old niece can make one better than all of them . it does not take an expert to know these swords are just crap .  newline newline  well ... i do , however , have something that you may find interesting .  colt dives back into his bag until i stop him in the track . newline newline  a few sets of broken armor , some dozens of stinky boots , probably several maces and axes ...  i speak without looking at the bag ,  seriously , why you always have to do this to me . i am sick of buying your junks . they do nt even sell !  newline newline  but i spend so much time looting them from the roads and camps ! can not you be more considerate about the hard work i have spent gathering them ?  colt looks at me with his teary eyes . not this again i say to myself . newline newline  this is why i hate adventurers ... fine . i will take them . put them on the scale .  newline newline  a ... what ?  newline newline  put them on the scale , damn it .  i look at him with my hands crossed ,  you do nt expect me to price them one by one , right ?  newline newline  but ... but ...  newline newline  either that or no deal . seriously , i am already taking a big risk of buying all these crap from you .  newline newline  sigh ... fine .  colt puts the bag on the scale and nearly breaks it . i give him a silver and some copper . he nods and smiles like an idiot . maybe i should have paid less in the first place . but his reaction is always the best to lighten my day . newline newline colt leaves the shop while rumbling about the new sword he plans to buy . meanwhile i put the closed sign on the door and start the treasure dive . i hope i could find one thing that can sell more than five copper . yeoman , let me see it again .  newline newline commander whites holo deck whirred to life as the crewman forwarded the data files to him . in half a second data streams began to pan across his holo , paired with visual imagery of their trajectory , planetary system information , their current velocity , and various other important numbers and figures . the commander scowled at the data as it bathed his face in an artificial blue light . his worst fear had been realized . newline newline just two hours prior the icv mercury had reported a total loss of engine power . further examination of the malfunction revealed that during the fasterthanlight transit the ship had passed incredibly close to a stype red giant . solar radiation had overcome the artificial magnetic field of the mercury and fried all electronics . this would have killed the crew  however , the icv mercury s engines were to the aft of the shuttle and as such protected by a secondary shield . the primary shielding , charged with protecting life support , crew quarters , and command , had held off the radiation . newline newline at the time of the incident the engines were occupied by a skeleton crew , enough to maintain the massive propulsion systems . radiation alarms had gone off , but the incident happened so quick no one back there had time to react . at least their deaths were painless , the commander mused darkly . he d never lost a man before , but now ? now he was at risk of losing the entire ship . currently the engine rooms were flooded with a deadly amount of radiation . until that was flushed and scrubbed no one could get in and preform a diagnostic on the engine . they were in every sense of the phrase , dead in the water . newline newline white studied over the data on his holo . meanwhile all around him crew members buzzed through command  amp  control . all with their own job to do , none bothered the captain . several of whites top crewman sat in waiting at their positions . yeoman pulaski , a dour blonde woman , charged with clerical duties aboard the mercury  essentially a secretary , but with navel training and a phd in physics  . there was lieutenant park , a hulk of a man who doubled as both captain of the guard and whites  philosophical sparring partner . finally their was chief engineer henry lafayette , who was ... well the chief engineer . behind his corneas , white could barely make out a flicker of orange , which came from his cybernetic implant . the engineer was reviewing data while he waited . newline newline normally commander white would have his second in command cui zhang at his side , but the young woman had been tasked with seeing to the the duties of the crew . white glanced up from his holo and caught sight of the compact woman as she strode confidently from station to station issuing commands at his behest . she worked well under pressure it s why she was his second , commander material through and through , but she was still half a decade off from getting her own ship . newline newline too bad she ll never get the chance . newline newline  captain ?  the chief engineer said , rousting white from his internal deliberations . the orange flicker had vanished from his eye . newline newline  yes , lafayette .  white acknowledged . newline newline  i ve been reviewing the data and i do nt think it s too late to salvage our mission .  white gestured for lafayette to continue . taking the hint the engineer continued ,  so currently our trajectory had us on a crash course with hawking3 . that s unavoidable , but the mercury comes with lifeboats . i say we pile the crew into the planetary landers and abandon ship .  newline newline white shouted down at a crewman ,  sullivan ! what s the status of the landers .  the crewman jerked up from his station as if shocked . newline newline  no damage recorded on the logs , sir .  newline newline  makes sense ,  white scratched his chin ,  primary shield also covers the landers too .  however like a finger to a body the landers were the most distal part of the ship , white needed to make sure they did nt get burned by the radiation .  continue with your thought , chief .  newline newline lafayette spoke ,  so we abandon ship with the landers and use their working engines to safety get the crew planetside on h3 .  newline newline hawking3 was the name of their final destination . a super earth , smack dap in the green zone of the star hawking . much like earth it was the third planet from the star  thus the  3   , but much unlike earth h3 was a part of a massive planetary system . 15 celestial bodies orbited hawking , which in comparison to sol was twice the mass . ten of those bodies were gas giants that inhabited the outer regions of the system , the other five were terrestrial world s . only h3 sat within the green zone . newline newline pulaski jumped in ,  the shuttles do not have enough deltav to slow us down though . if my models are correct , and they almost always are , we could nt even shed half our velocity . we d end up crashing maybe 100,000 kilometers away from the mercury , but we d crash all the same .  newline newline  what about our rcs tanks ?  lafayette parried . newline newline  the mercury s reaction control systems would not provide any meaningful difference .  pulaski shot back . lafayette s face turned a shade a pink and he looked to press his argument , but white cut him off . newline newline white :  pulaski , i m looking at planetary data here . what can you tell me about gravitational adjustments ?  newline newline the yeoman ran a hand through her short blonde hair .  i see what you re getting at commander , but unfortunately we entered the system at a fairly unpopulated angle . not only that , but the planets we are relatively close to are actually what s causing our trajectory to collide with h3 . here and here , these two jovian bodies are actually dragging us behind them . their pull is putting our course directly onto h3 .  newline newline white scratched at his chin . so it s the nbody problem . in a perfect universe there would be no collisions . newton s laws of motion and universal gravitation would prevent it . given two orbiting bodies , and the nearfrictionless nature of space , neither body would collide with the other . they d dance eternal in a cosmic black . but space is nt as simple as that , not by a long shot . there are trillions of stars and even more planets . all of them pulling at each other like angry siblings fighting over a toy . thanks to that universal tugofwar objects such as meteors and dwarf planets , and sometimes spaceships get hurtled directly into other planets . it is an eternal cosmic dance where the dancers are constantly punching each other in the face and stepping on one another s toes . newline newlineisabella picked at the rutted wood of the counter in front of her . her door was wide open , and no patrons had come in today . she could see the sun setting over the stone walls of the city . it would be closing time soon . newline her wares were sparse , ancient maces and half rusted armor dotted the walls . the place wasn  t impressive , and isabella didn  t really blame adventurers for not wanting to do business in this part of town . newline newline just as she was about to close her empty ledger , the sound of heavy footfalls came from the doorway . a woman stood in the once empty store . she was dressed head to toe in shiny armor , some of it , including some sort of sigil , was obscured by her thick burgundy cloak . newline newline  ah ! welcome , buying or selling ?  isabella asked in a friendly tone as the woman came closer to the counter without a word . she seemed to examine the wares the store had on offer before taking one more glance at the door . newline newline  selling . you buy swords , correct ?  the woman  s voice was hoarse as it echoed out from under her hood . isabella nodded , a smile still on her face . newline newline  indeed . the more unique the better !  newline newline the woman seemed to shift , moving to pull something out of the sheath on her back , which was hidden by the cloak . newline newline a glittering blade came into the dim light of the shop , and isabella couldn  t help it when her eyes widened . newline  is this ?  she asked , obviously in awe as she reached to touch the gleaming thing . newline newline newline the woman cut her off before she could speak .  please , don  t speak its name aloud  she urged in a hushed tone . isabella merely nodded , understanding . newline newline newline  how much do you want for it ? i don  t even know if i have enough gold on hand for what it  s worth.  isabella wanted this sword , more than anything in the world . newline newline newline the hooded woman thought for a moment and looked around the shop for another moment .  give me what you have in gold , and i  ll take that  she pointed up on the wall to a multifaceted mace with a heavy handle . the thing was taller than isabella by a foot , but the woman before her was large , and she had no doubt this woman could wield the giant thing easily . newline newline newline isabella excitedly nodded and opened the till . the woman left with the large mace slung over her shoulder and about 300 pieces of gold . the shopkeeper was over the moon , she shinned the new sword as she watched the lamps being lit out on the street . newline newline another set of steps made her whirl around . another patron ! newline newline  oh my goodness ! is that  thunderfury , blessed blade of the windseeker  ?  newline hey guy ! stop it guy !  the ferocious canadian said as he was stabbed a sixth time by the american . johnny washington stepped off the flappyheaded enemy after he stopped moving , after the seventh stab , and hurried over to srgt . roger steel to regroup . newline newline  is that the last of them ?  steel asked as he wiped blood off his forehead with a red , white and blue handkerchief he got way back in arizona , back before the  war  . newline newline  yes sir . all of them sir .  johnny said with a sigh and salute . newline newline  then , that s it . we are done .  steel dropped the patriotic handkerchief over the beady eyes of the deadman under his boot and nodded . newline newline  done ? sir , i do nt understand .  newline newline  i mean we re are done . command called in . it took four years , but every canadian is dead . all of them . every single one of them .  newline newline  wait , se ... permission to speak freely sir !  johnny recomposed himself before coninuting . newline newline  war s over son . i m not your c.o . anymore . go on , speak anyway you wish .  newline newline  seriously ? ! they are all dead ? they were a first world developed nation !  newline newline  ... ... hahahahahaha .  steel tried not to laugh too hard .  anyway , so job s finished . wow , they really wanted oregon for some reason .  newline newline  yyeah , that was weird . we still do nt know why they wanted it ?  newline newline  still no clue at all .  newline newline  that s crazy . i mean , they have the population of one of our states and ... we re the freaking united states . they must have wanted something . what were they thinking ?  newline newline  i do nt know . but ... shit . i did nt think a war with canada would last a week . i think the only way it could have lasted this long is it every single one of them went to war at the same time .  newline newline  word .  johnny coughed .  i mean , yes sir .  newline newline as both men watched the setting sun , the first sunset the world had known without the mountie menace in four long year , their focus was drawn to a shouting man at the base of the hill . steel saw the messenger and for a moment wonder why he did not just call their phones ... as it was the year 2019 ... but still , the messenger ran up to them , eagerly , sweating profusely like he had been running a while . newline newline  sir ... .i ... we ... from command ...  the traveler spoke in batted breathes . newline newline  whoa , easy there son . calm down . take a breather and say what you need to say in that order .  newline newline  yes sir ... .pheeeww .  the young man , no older than twenty , wipe sweat off his brow .  we ... just heard ... the reason for the war sir . why all these ... .mapleheads came ... to die for oregon .  he pulled out a folded paper from his back pocket , with the seal of washington stamped on its unopened crease . newline newline steel quickly opened the letter and read through the confidential text . then again . then once more , his eyes widening in terror . newline newline  no ... no , no . no ! no ! what have we done ? !  he fell to his knees and ripped the paper in half .  it was bieber ! they were sick of his shit and wanted to take him back ! he was going to move here before the war ! they wanted to stop bieber and we did nt let them !  he screamed at the heavens , at himself , at his misinformed government who ordered him to shoot first and ask questions later .  what have we done ! ? by god , what have we done ! ! ! ?  newline newline johnny , staying silent this time , walked up to his commanding officer ... to his friend ... and put his hand on the broken man s shoulder .  ... we did our duty sir .  newline newline  heeeelllp meeeeeeeee ... .  newline newline the boy looked at his companion .  i think he s trying to say something .  newline newline  would nt you ? at best he s got a few weeks to live , might as well try for more ?  newline newline   no ... .kill ... i ... .  newline newline  maybe we should have given him less limbs . that ca nt be comfortable .  newline newline  excellent for making tuna fish sandwiches , though !  newline newline  you sometimes make me glad animals are nt in control of their own evolution . now shut your cake hole and help me push him into the driveway .  newline newline they began to shove him onto the driveway , but the snowman falls over and his head splats in the middle of the driveway . newline newline  he died the way he lived , as a pile of snow .  newline newline  you absolute furbucket !  newline newline  ... wait . this gives me an idea ! get dad s bike , three hammers , roller skates , some glue , and a bowl of noodles !  newline newline   caaaaaaaalllllvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnn ! your hot cocoa is ready !  newline newline  can we wait until after the hot cocoa ? i need to dry off my fur !  newline newline  fine , but you re setting up the ramp .  newline newline ...it s christmas time , but the one person i want most ca nt be there . she only lives a few minutes away , but the distance is nt the issue . i have loved her for so long . this year we tried . we failed . newline newline i failed . newline newline she wants me to stop trying , i do nt want to . but it brings us both pain when i try . she says she does nt want to lose me entirely . i ca nt lose her either . so i ll stop trying . i ll give her the space she needs ... the space we both need . i already lost my girlfriend . newline newline i ca nt lose my best friend , too . newline newline not again .when the world ended , we all felt lost . some took up new hobbies , like jogging or coding , some found new mmos , but they switched between mmos , unable to find the perfect experience . i turned my life into my game . going to work was grinding for gold , going to the gym was leveling stats . my charsima was maxed out in a year , people wondered why i became more social after years of solitude . newline newline i was able to exist in the world by existing in the world . i never changed , only the game was different . newline newline its been 5 years since the world ended and the new world began . i ve been grinding all this time , but all for nothing . no raids , no battles , no warcraft . all this grinding for nothing , endless clicking without any payoff . newline newline i only hope there is warcraft in the next world .truman , truman , truman . where to start . i guess , as all stories go , we should start at the beginning , when he walked out of the dome . no one expected that to happen , hell , even the creator probably would nt have seen it coming . that show had been running for so long that no one did nt know who truman was . newline newline i m getting off topic , though . when truman left the dome , he walked the city of los angeles . everyone went crazy . no one had ever seen him in person , only the actors on the set , and they rarely left said set . people wanted him to sign their dvd s , shirts , coffee mugs , their babies face s . it must have been a little difficult for him to adjust to this new life , but he adapted , eventually . newline newline the market brand for truman never left . it thrived well past the cancelation of the show itself , and even truman himself . you can still see a dvd of the truman show in your local movie store . sorry , my old brain digresses a lot . he eventually wrote a book , best seller on his name alone . i think it was titled ,  truman : my life in the dome  . newline newline not only did he make lots of money from his book , he had his own private fund , set up by the producer in case something like this happened . it had exactly 1  of all the earning off any truman brand merchandise . it was the was more than the gdp of california . he was one of the richest man alive . newline newline of course , truman never got over his paranoia . he always questioned everything around him , even whether he was still in the dome . he even questioned whether his wife loved him . still , he had a happy life . he started a movement to stop the ability for corporations to adopt children , even got bills passed . newline newline truman never really interacted with people much , other than the people who actually cared . he worked in the entertainment industry for awhile , mostly small roles , occasionally writing some of them . he was a brilliant man , despite his quirky attitude and way of speaking . newline newline despite it all , all the odds and trauma , despite it all , he made it . just like when he survived that boat . he made it , clenching teeth , refusing to quit . that s the man we should all want to be .jimmy was not an arrogant man . he had used his influence once or twice to change the world , and he was aware of his personal power as one of the cofounder of wikipedia , but he was not an arrogant man . despite that , he could not help but feel affronted , having to wait in front of a door which led to the room of a middleaged nobody . who have ever heard of zachariah elmer ? not him , nor wikipedia , that  s who . newline newline not even the new wikipedia knew him . newline newline  sorry , my room  s a mess , ji er , mr. wales.  elmer said apologetically , which smoothed jimmy  s rising impatience slightly . something fell to the floor , and he heard the man inside swear loudly .  it  s fine , you can call me jimmy . i don  t really mind if the room is messy , by the way.  he glanced at his iwatch and wonder if it was wise to skip a day of work for this . the police will probably think he was avoiding them . newline newline elmer  s hesitation was palpable . then , the door was unlocked and opened . jimym was greeted by a surprisingly clean man . a grey cat tried to dart out . jimmy reached down and stroked its fur . it purred .  um , hi . i  m zack , but you probably already know.  zack said awkwardly .  you  re a lot older than how i imagine you.  newline newline  you uploaded a photo of me as a grayhaired old man.  jimmy observed . newline  did i ? sorry , the augur doesn  t really know what is appropriate to put up.  the augur was the name of the mysterious editor who had gripped the media  s attention by vandalizing wikipedia articles with what appeared to be information from the future . newline newline  the government wasn  t happy about the augur . they think it  s a second wikileaks waiting to happen . plus , they know where you live.  he stopped petting the cat , and it darted away . newline  so this is a cease and desist ?  zack asked without any defiance in his voice . newline  of course not . the augur is changing the world . if i stopped him , i  d probably get assassinated.  jimmy said , standing up .  may i come in ?  newline  yes , of course.  jimmy walked in and , despite zack pulling his workdesk chair out for him , sat on the messy bed . zack dropped heavily onto his chair . it creaked . newline newline  i  m guessing you want explanations.  zack said . jimmy  s eyes followed his towards the laptop , which is automatically copypasting information from wikipedia to wikipedia ? newline  the augur is a computer program . it can access the internet of a universe parallel to us.  newline newline  how ?  the wikipedia founder blurted out . the trials and tribulations of the past month rendered him not questioning this extraordinary story . newline newline  uh . magic.  zack said , making an awkward wave with his hand . before jimmy could talk , he spoke quickly .  no . really . i was developing a web browser on my custom os , and it turns out the thing is connected to a different universe  s internet . heck , it doesn  t even need a functioning internet , although obviously i need that to connect to our internet.  newline newline  so you  re telling me that you somehow created the first portal to an alternate reality . and it  s a web browser.  jimmy stared at the screen .  but why wikipedia ?  newline newline zack glanced at his own laptop . the augur is copying an article on electric cars . he made no indication of answering . newline newline  why even share it ?  jimmy asked .  the information you have in your hand . it could make you powerful beyond imagination.  the man had faced his own demons when it comes to power . newline newline  if you had access to knowledge that nobody else had known before , won  t you want to share it too ? everyone go on wikipedia . if i posted it on a random site , nobody would actually listen to the augur.  newline newline  we blocked your ip for a while . we thought the augur was a vandal . until hurricane erin.  jim pointed out . newline newline  and now everybody  s listening , aren  t they ?  zack asked .  well , i know i should hand the laptop over to the government . or maybe even cern . the folks there would go nuts . you know , i sent myself an email in that alternate reality.  newline newline  did he reply ?  newline newline  yeah , he said it was an interesting read . he made the os and the browser 30 years ago and it was terrible and inefficient , and it wasn  t something he was proud of . he said he doesn  t know why a kid thought it would be funny to make up an outrageous story about them . but , it was cool to read.  newlinethe year is 2058 , and the government is in control of everything , even our dreams . newline newline newline the infamous 2040 revolution , the day when man finally stood up against the snakes and vultures of officials and senators . thousands of people were hurt , some even killed in all the madness . after that , they did nt want us having as much free will , so they began to control us . turn us into senseless drones , programmed from birth for their purpose . newline they monitored our schooling , any programs we watched , the music we heard , if any at all . our minds were programmed by these things to only think or know about what they wanted . but then , people began to have ideas when they slept . dreamers became a problem . they saw through all the censorship , they could imagine the possibilities of a different world . again in small groups they began to fight . but their attempts were snuffed out swiftly and easily with the release of the new  dreamcube x  . newline newline  with this new device , no longer will you have random dreams that make no sense , or even frighten you . for the low low price of 5,899x you will own the government mandated device . with its simple touch interface , you can go onto our largely constructed database of preselected dreams . now you can choose what you dream about with simplicity and ease !  newline newline of course , people did nt see this as one of the hugest ways to take away our free will , but , that is how life has always been , and so they drone on , and buy the dreamcube , and life goes on as always . newline newline aila had always been a little different from the other kids . she asked obscure questions like  but why is the sky blue , instead of purple , or green , or even pink !  the teacher never knew how to respond to those kinds of questions , the sky is blue because blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in earth s atmosphere . blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter , smaller waves . newline newline imagination , nobody had any . except for aila . newline she liked to draw , and write short stories . but she had to keep them hidden . creativity was illegal , punishable by death . newline newline aila had a dreamcube , which she had to plug into every night . the cube always did override her true dreams . but her dreams always tried to break through . she actually had to have her dreamcube sent in for repairs 5x now since getting it . they found it very odd , but could nt figure out why . newline newline aila went on to college to study in computer engineering and programming . she liked to study the robots and devices around her , curious how they controlled everyone . newline newline she worked diligently on a program to hack her dreamcube so that she could really dream , but no one would know , and it would appear the government mandated dream sequence was running smoothly . newline newline after 5 long months of coding , she finally did it . newline as she positioned herself into bed , and placed the dreamhalo on her head , she grew anxious . what would she see ? would it be wonderful ? horrible ? newline newline she booted up the program newline newline

aila . she was immersed into a beautiful world . lions that were blue were grazing in the field , yes grazing ! they neighed at her as she giggled and walked by , extending her hand as she brushed the grass and walked towards the mountains ahead . she saw a person , neither man nor woman appear in the sky . she felt the urge to go towards them , like they were going to tell her everything about everything . she began to run , excited , tears streaming down her face . finally , she will know what everything is about , where we come from , the truth . newline newline her vision began to blur , and everything began to ripple and flash . everything went blank , completely . aila was suddenly standing in a completely dark nothingness that went on forever . newline newline  no , no please no  she thought , grasping around for anything . words began to appear in the nothingness in front of her , scrolling and being typed out . newline newline newline  dreamcube  20580522 22:05:22  warning :

and great fortunes , would soon lie ahead . newline unfortunately , the feelings brought on by it were so fragile and fleeting that they could easily vanish in an instant . as soon as it had departed our realm , even a moment without could be so unbearably excruciating to some that it s return was always an event worth rejoicing over . newline once it resurfaced , such was the turn up . for all who felt it would herald it s return for anyone nearby to share with : newline  it s fucking lit ! tyler tested the bonds slightly . newline newline ah , zip ties . he was familiar with zip ties . it was a good substitute for handcuffs easy to carry , cheap and cutting into the victim s neck or wrists with just a little bit of movement . newline newline it was a pity , but people did nt seem to realize it was easy enough to slip out of if you put your wrist in a specific position as you were being tied up . newline newline tyler smiled broadly to himself beneath the black bag tied around his head . he could feel the car rumbling beneath him as it swerved this way and that . newline newline at last , they stopped somewhere . he was dragged out into a light rain and further into some sheltered area a warehouse by the docks , he guessed , from the smell of saltwater in the air and the patter of rain on zinc roofing . newline newline someone sat him on a chair and pulled off the bag . newline newline  good evening .  newline newline he blinked for a moment . let s see ... swinging light bulb , check . thugs with guns , check . menacing mastermind standing halfhidden in the shadows , check . newline newline monologue , check . the man was blabbing at him about some kind of masterplan . money was involved somewhere . murder too . newline newline  ... all you need is a white cat ...  he murmured to himself . newline newline  do nt look so confused .  the shadowed man said , ignoring his mutters ,  if you cooperate and tell me what i want to know , you wo nt be hurt ... much .  newline newline  kill .  he mumbled . newline newline  what ?  the shadowed man leaned in . newline newline he sighed and dropped the worried face he d been keeping fixed up the whole time .  kill . not hurt .  he said clearly , smiling ,  what kind of wuss are you starting out with a minor threat like that ?  newline newline he d slipped out of the zipties a few moments ago . he lunged forward in a single fluid motion , snapping into a roll as he grabbed the shadowed man by the neck and used him as an impromptu meat shield . newline newline a few rounds found their targets in his shield but he was already ducking behind a large wooden crate in the shadows . his captive whimpered under his arm . newline newline  hush now ... if you stay put , i wo nt kill you dead .  newline newline he leapt aside , sneaking behind one of the thugs nearing his crate and grabbing the man by the neck . there was a crack and he moved away , dancing around the chair he d been sat on moments before . he picked it up and slammed it into another thug , snapping off the chair leg and stabbing it into the man s vulnerable throat . newline newline he grinned as he rose , tossing the bloodied chair leg away . the last thug was running out of the building . casually , he picked up a gun from a fallen thug and aimed . newline newline  and then there were none .  newline newline the last thug fell with the bang , slumping outside . the rain did not quite disguise the gradually darkening puddle around his form . newline newline he walked behind the wooden crate only to find the man he d left there trying to crawl away . he stepped on the man s back . newline newline  you re an amateur are nt you ?  he mused . he lifted the injured man by the collar , dragging him back to the centre of the warehouse . newline newline without hesitation , he emptied a bullet into the man s shoulder . there was a scream and a splash of red . he stepped on the shoulder , grinding his heel down slightly to the sound of whimpers . newline newline he leaned down , smiling beatifically as he pulled the man up by his tie . newline newline  now , this is how you do a proper interrogation ...  newlinei would wait until she fell asleep . then i  d simply grip her by the throat and dig in . not the most elegant plan , i admit , but effective nonetheless . i told holly , but she just licked herself and grinned at me before running out to chase a bird . why the stupid woman would get two dogs when she clearly hates us is beyond me . but then the second dog had to be holly , who is probably retarded . i still think holly was foisted on me out of spite . newline newline when i turned back to go lie inside , yagami was watching me . he was preening on top of a cupboard , but stopped to stare at me , bright green eyes narrowed . newline newline  don  t even think about it , doug ,  he hissed , jumping lightly to the ground .  i detest hunting birds . that human feeds me , the way i like it.  newline newline  she ties me up in the garden most days ,  i growled back .  i won  t take it anymore . and you can  t stop me.  newline newline i felt his eyes on me all day , though he kept himself out of reach of my teeth . sneaky little bastard , too cowardly to face any fight with honour . ellie chased me out of the house when she came home and put the leash back on , slamming the door firmly behind her . i  d been prepared for this , however . it had taken weeks to get the message across to holly  that she must drag the leash back over my head once i was tied up tonight . luckily it was already loosened enough by my own efforts . holly finally managed it , rolling in the dirt with joy afterwards . i sighed and ruffled her belly with my snout . i sometimes suspected she had difficulty distinguishing between me and ellie . newline newline i padded lightly through the hallways , listening to the rhythmic sounds of snoring coming from her bedroom . in the doorway , i bared my teeth when i spotted her sleeping form . i would enjoy this . newline newline  doug ,  i heard a quiet whisper . yagami  s eyes shone in the darkness . newline newline  get out of here ,  i said . ellie turned restlessly in her sleep . my whisper was a finely honed skill , but still quite loud . newline newline  c  mon , i want to talk.  yagami slipped past me , looking back over his shoulder .  you can always munch on her later.  i sighed and followed  newline despite myself , i was curious . a dog  s curse , you might say . newline newline in the small room where my  usually empty  bowl stood , i paused . newline the bowl was filled to the brim with food . i immediately began to salivate , glancing at yagami in confusion . newline newline  i know she hasn  t fed you yet today , thought you might like a little bite to eat . it wasn  t hard to tip the bag into the bowl , though holly helped me . you can thank her later.  newline newline  why are you doing this ?  i asked suspiciously , but walked over to my bowl anyway . newline newline  like i said , i want to talk.  he yawned , revealing needlesharp little teeth , and smiled .  think of it as a peace offering , eh ?  newline newline i considered it for a second then shrugged before attacking the food . it had a funny taste , though it was still pleasant . she must  ve bought a new brand . newline newline  so what is it you so desperately need to discuss ?  i asked , looking up . newline newline to my horror , ellie was standing there  glaring at me in her pyjamas . newline yagami snaked around her legs , looking smug . ellie screamed at me to get out and smacked my head . she tied me up more firmly this time before returning to the house . i stared at the moon , and thought about what i d do to that cat when i got hold of him . later , holly walked over . newline newline  sorry . thought you hungry ,  she said , trying her best to speak . it was a lost art , really , not all animals could do it . i suppose holly wasn  t much more stupid than most . newline newline  i was ,  i sighed .  it was nice though , thanks.  newline newline  added sweet stuff ,  said holly with a grin .  yagami said it good.  newline newline  what ?  i asked .  what sweet stuff ?  newline newline  dark sweet stuff ,  holly clarified helpfully .  uhmwas ellie  s . yagami bit newline it to pieces , i helped put in bowl . was good ?  newline newline holly  s face looked slightly blurry . actually , everything looked kind of fuzzy now . i shivered , and decided to lie down for a bit . i closed my eyes . exhaustion swept over me , and i was glad to be outside , where the cool air was soothing on my warm skin . newline you ever seen anything like it ?  newline newline faith s words seemed almost lost against the vast firestorm , the roaring flames and frenzied winds whipping themselves into a fury . the library , one of the last remaining bastions of knowledge and arcane lore in this new dark age had gone up in flames , the red and oranges blazes charring the stonework black and shattering the stained glass windows . no one paid the tragic loss any heed  the defenders either slain or busy fleeing , the triumphant usurpers lost in their sack . horses dripping skin and molten fire galloped around the stable yard , their manes whisping plumes black smoke . newline newline high up in one of the lesser keeps , the chaos unfolding below looked more like a scene from a play or novel , or else one of those fabled tales from myth and song . newline newline  once ,  a firm baritone voice answered .  on the night of the arrival .  newline newline hilary flint sat on the edge of faith s rumpled bed , already armed and armored in full kit . his green cloak was pinned at his throat by a broach , a rolled blanket slung over a shoulder and across his torso . his rifle lay perched next to him , his saber in his hands and receiving a final touch up with a whetstone . the rasp of the stone against the tired steel was little more than a whisper of the inferno outside . newline newline  detroit was a major hub for passenger jets flying in and out of asia ,  flint said .  one flight , maybe heading towards japan or shanghai , went down a few miles east of campus . the thing was loaded with avgas when it crashed right down on top of a neighborhood . of course the passengers and crew died instantly , but the folks on the ground ... i saw the results myself two days later when i was biking back home as fast as i could ride . the medical personnel just flat up left them , all stacked up like cord wood . i slipped into one of those triage centers , hoping to find some medicine left in their haste or at least some bandages and the like . i passed by their corpses , the revoltingly delicious stench of roast pork some of them were still alive , burnt black and still conscious somehow . i shat my pants when one of them grabbed hold of my leg , screaming as his whole arm came off when i jumped back . newline newline  i ran . oh , how i ran , and i did nt stop until i reached brighton and fell down from exhaustion . and you can bet that that memory s lingered for damn sure . sitting in my seat , i look out the window and take in the view . these seats are hard and uncomfortable , but the scenery is definitely worth it . trees so green , filled with animals i ve only read about . coming out to look upon the roaring beast that has engulfed many people . some animals see it as a monster , while others see it as a prison . we humans , never thought it would be a metal coffin , except those few with paranoia eating at their mind and the over analytic . newline newline curious i decided to explore this metal beast . i get up from my seat , while my parents were asleep . as i enter a new car , i pass a woman . she gazes outside with a distant look . blue eyes that seemed to shine , now dim with grief . long hair like liquid fire , thrown across one shoulder  tucked messing beneath a black hat . such rosy cheeks and a jolly face , now stained with tears . skin like snow placed upon a small frame . what looked so strong , now streaked with sadness , seemed so fragile . dressed in black with white trimmings , like a broken mirror , seemed to reflect the state of her soul . my heart breaks as i take in the sight . she turns her head towards me ,

to my original spot , when i hear a sickening grunt of metal . the groan and the loss of gravity that came after , made me lose any composure i had . i grabbed the nearest seat and held on tightly , as the world continued tilting . watching people fall from above , reaching towards me . clawing at my arms and pulling at my hair , screaming as they passed by me . in a few seconds i hear the

this and find my parents , at least then i ll cry . i look around and see a pile of bodies , people groaning , and so much blood . it made me sick to my stomach . it all felt like a horrible nightmare

lightly around me . her heart beat steadying , slowing down , and becoming weaker . she leans her head towards my ear , wincing in pain . she whispers in my ear , her voice becoming weaker ,  i had a

the ballestas and catapults of old . they sat behind the mountains over 30km away and used magnets to launch giant molten balls the size of a man , burning the enemy alive . it was a sight to behold

to stay with him . his friends had all told him he was smart to stay with the rich parent , but that had nt been the reason , had it ? at the time , he had told himself that his father needed him more . he did . dad had been really bad at taking care of himself . without his mother , someone had to be there to deal with dad when he was lonely and angry and ... drunk . newline newline but that did nt matter now . a couple years of putting up with his dad , and francis had gotten into his dream school . even with dirt sat scores . he probably should nt have gone , in retrospect . that school was way too intense for him . four and a half hellish years that tore away at him until all that was left was a raw mess of a human being . but , at least he got a degree . a degree and helen . newline newline looking back , helen was the best thing to come out of those years . but francis knew that to find work , he would need to move to the east coast . his dad had some connections out there , so it made for his best chances . but helen s gramps was sick . he knew helen was torn . it was obvious . move out east for the boyfriend ? or move back to your small hometown to spend what ended up being the last 14 months of her grandfather s life with him ? francis could nt force that decision on her . he did the only thing he could think of at the time . and so he moved out east alone . newline newline had it been worth it ? he had found his dream job through one of his father s obscure connections that even his father had hardly remembered . at least it was what he had thought would be his dream job . great starting salary , even better benefits . but his degree had nt prepared him as well as he thought it would . the workload was more than expected as well . he ended up working long hours , longer than most of the people in the office . his personal life , what little personal life he had , began to suffer . newline newline so here he found himself . years later , glaring out his highrise window with the lights of the city glaring back . he took a last swig of scotch and let the glass fall to the floor . they d clean the mess up in the morning . his apartment , spacious and modern , was empty except for him and shadows . the shirt whose sweatstained collar clawed at the back of his neck day after day lay discarded on the bed beside him . he hated it . he hated them . all of them . what did they have that he did nt ? he had sacrificed himself his entire life to help those around him : his parents , his friends , his girlfriends , his employees . he sacrificed everything for them . and what did he have to show for it ? a highpaying job ? a nice apartment ? nothing . he had nothing . well , at least he had this . the weight in his other hand felt

probability and reality around himself . a man who researchers speculated could have possessed the most powerful ability yet known . what had he used it for ?i finished the last of my basic stretches with a hand on a nearby park bench for balance . still feeling a little stiff , i took a deep breath and began a slow jog down the concrete path . nothing feels quite as good as an early morning run to get loose in the morning . takes a bit longer to loosen up nowadays , but that s life . it s not like this park is ever crowded , so i can always take as long as i need . calling it a park is a bit generous ... it s one of those wetlands conservation locations that the city does to show they care . just a small wooded area with a pond in the middle full of fetid water . but i do nt mind the smell and the moist air is much better than the middle east . newline newline seems like the guy today is a cut above the rest . no idea where he is , but i know he s watching . or maybe she . that would be a nice change of pace . the temperature noticeably drops a few degrees as i entered the wooded part of the path . i slowed my breathing and made sure that i fully emptied my lungs with each breath . i noticed that i was clenching my jaw a little in anticipation . i let it slacken so it did nt disrupt my hearing . newline newline as i came around a bend in the path i saw three geese standing on the path . fucking geese . the one thing i hate about this park is the geese . shitting all over the path and almost exclusively on the path . one of the geese , getting agitated at my approach , opened his wings and began hissing . i thought about just running straight through it , but like every time before i moved to the side of the path and went around . newline newline the hairs on my neck prickled and i dove back toward the path . something painfully grazed the side of my running shoe , but i break my fall with a quick roll and assess the situation . the guy was about 6 foot tall and wiry . slightly smaller than me , but at least 10 years younger and dressed in a skintight black tee shirt and bicycle tights . without a word , he closed the distance and brought his baton down in a slashing backhand . an asp tactical baton . would have broken my kneecap if i had nt dodged earlier . i was right . this guy was a step above . no shitty louisville slugger bat for this guy . newline newline i shot forward rather than dancing back . staying low , i deflected the baton wide with one arm while scooping up one of his legs with my other . i made eye contact before putting my head into his side and noticed there was no alarm on his face , just concentration . good . very good . newline newline i threw all of my weight forward into him as i pulled his legs from underneath him to take him down . i felt him pull his legs up and his shins push against my thighs while he snaked a hand behind my neck and pulled . ha ! he s using my momentum against me . he might actually know how to fight . i let go of his leg and used an arm to push off the ground and regain control of my momentum . as i tried to somersault , i was pulled back when he trapped my other arm and ended up only landing on my back . newline newline he gave me no space and was against me immediately while trapping an arm against the side of my head . i bucked hard against the ground and rolled to get my legs under me and was rewarded with the baton digging across my windpipe as he secured a headlock on me . i could feel my face getting hotter as the blood rushed to it ... but i could also feel the heat building in my chest as the rage spread . this is it . the feeling you ca nt get anywhere else . newline newline my smile was a grimace as i felt him jump and wrap his legs around me . we fell to the ground and i drove forward into him to maximize the impact . my head was awkwardly crammed into his chest , but i felt his legs were nt crossed yet and scrambled free of them . the pressure eased on my neck since it only had arm strength behind it , but he was stubborn and held on . i heard him breathing raggedly and slapped him openhanded across the face . his head bounced on the pavement and i heard a funny sound escape from his lips . i crammed my fingers and hand into his mouth as far as it would fit and wrapped my thumb underneath his chin . his bottom teeth dug into the palm of my hand and it felt great . i tightened my shoulder and wrenched my hand downward . newline newline a sickly popping sound mixed with gagging greeted my ears and his grip immediately released . i took in glorious gulps of air and watched as my assailant writhed on the ground . his hands went to his face and then fell away with a groan as they found his dislocated jaw that was loosely hanging by skin . blood was leaking from one side of his mouth and he choked . newline newline  very good ,  i said between breaths ,  but this is hardly the ufc .  newline newline a hissing goose ran forward and bit at the man s neck . it repeatedly hassled him as he screamed and tried to roll away . a second later the goose ran away and shit all over the path as it did . i laughed hysterically . i will never get enough of this ! newlinedear mother , newline newline i write this to you now sitting in a hole in the middle of nowhere covered in 6 inches of snow . other than that i

jim as he reached for the handle . as soon as he touched the door , a loud beeping noise came out of it and a window popped . it read  warning : fast travel is highly disadvised while an enemy is

burrowed into his nose crawled through his head and commenced eating his brain . although , anything that ate mr. lansing  s brain would die from the monotony that has lived there for years and gone rancid . newline my life changed a few months ago when these sessions started . i was now a pupil , a man required to memorize the ramblings of a recluse in the hopes of acquiring a job of such tedium even sisyphus would grow tired . yet , i exaggerate the dullness of the lessons as his constant fidgeting and offtopic fixation is enough to drive one mad . his quirks were starting to grab hold of me contorting my mind and causing me to wince at his odd mannerisms . his tone and mispronunciations were needles stabbed into my ears . spit would fly from his face and cause my muscles to tense . only the bell of his timekeeper marking the end of a session would alleviate my spasms . newline  did you get that steven ?  mr. lansing said . newline  of course sir  , i replied . newline his brow was furrowed in disappointment as he had caught my eyes wandering out the window and his gaze remained until i resumed my writing . i knew i had better reestablish attention as my apprenticeship required his approval . my only problem came from the angry that had began burrowing into my own head . at first , i had become flushed from the fury . then my body would almost rise from the chair causing me to cling to the armrests . i wanted to strike the man . i wanted him to feel the pain he had caused my mind in these months we had spent together . newline i was flushed and out of breath at this point the calls of my conscious to settle down were being repeated as i tried to reach a trancelike state . it wasn  t just in mr. lansing  s den i felt these urges anymore . if the thought of him crossed my mind during the daily drudge i would immediately become rabid throwing the nearest object at the wall or smashing my fists into the porcelain of my sink . with , no armrests to hold me back i was a ticking timebomb . i had learned nothing from him . i had only gained his lunacy . newline the bell echoes out across the room as my mind and body are washed in a river of relief . as he finishes his sentiments and bids me farewell a snide smile crosses my face . i nod farewell as a dark voice inside me bellows  until next time mr. lansing.  as i leave the den my mind is tantalized by images of me beating him accompanied by yells of ecstasy . newlinea phone call woke the sheriff in the middle of the night . a naked man was urinating behind a dumpster . newline newline it was a

. newline she watched him go with sad eyes and a shaky smile . no warm sensation , no progress tracker , no title . newline her message had been nothing more than a bit of trivial information by a

last item on the list . newline a wooden cart passed in front of her , throwing up dust . wheels creaking . newline hannah shielded her eyes from the sun , the weather was nice  it always was . it was that kind of village . newline some towns are shrouded in eternal mists , but not brighton . newline it was the kind of cheerful village of which every game had at least one . newline located in the midst of rolling green hills and blessed with eternal sunshine . newline at the surface it seemed like a perfect little village , full of hardworking , pleasant people . newline all lies . the true

miraculously appeared in her home . a quest reward for the hero . newline most quest givers gave maybe half of the reward to the hero , pocketing the rest for themselves . corrupt to the core .

the reward . never having to part with so much as a single coin . newline newline hannah decided to turn towards home , to her father s inn . newline as she opened the inn s heavy wooden door , she could hear her parents discussing their latest discovery . newline newline a large man lifted a small item above his bushy beard , subjecting it to his keen eyes ,  but look at the way it reflects the light . i m telling you this is special .  said her father ,  magical .  newline newline hannah s mother sighed ,  it s just a fork , dear .  she said , wiping down the wooden tables ,  it s not magical . it s just a fork .  newline newline the man s brow furrowed ,  but look at the way it catches the light ! this is akin to the kind of shine that magical swords have !  newline newline her mother threw the cleaning rag at him ,  it s nice that you finally show some appreciation for all the work i do , but that s just a wellpolished fork .  newline newline the man narrowed his eyes as he peered at the fork ,  charlotte , i m telling you . it glows ...  newline newline charlotte shook her head and finally noticed hannah ,  oh , hannah . be a dear and bring up a barrel of wine from the cellar , will you ?  newline newline hannah s shoulders sagged ,  again ? those things weigh a ton . ca nt dad do it ?  newline her mother had already turned her attention elsewhere . hannah sighed . newline the steps protested as she stomped down into the damp cellar , lighting the way ahead with a oil lamp . newline half a dozen large wooden barrels lined the walls . she stepped in front of one and prepared herself to move the damned thing . newline she jerked at the barrel with the amount of force required to move such a blasted heavy thing . it toppled over effortlessly . newline it rolled across the cellar floor , coming to an halt as it bumped into the wall . newline hannah raised an eyebrow and walked over to inspect the barrel , a cork decorated the lower portion of the back of the barrel . newline she placed her hand on the cork and pulled it out , remnants of wine dripped out . newline hannah looked back towards the other barrels and froze . newline there was a hole in the wall where the barrel had been . why was there a hole ? newline newline she crawled over and held up her oil lamp , the area beyond the hole seemed without end . newline hannah popped her head through the hole and glanced around . newline she locked eyes with a nasty little creature holding a cup , it seemed just as terrified as she was . newline the creature dropped the clay cup , it shattered .  oh no !  it squealed before running of into the darkness . newline she went quiet for a moment ,  hey ! get back here !  she finally said , feeling like it was expected of her . newline it seemed like the kind of thing one should say in a situation like this . newline she worked the remainder of her body through the narrow hole and began her pursuit . newline hannah needed more information to formulate a quest ,   hey , dude . there s a hole in my cellar .   would nt do . newline her surroundings gradually illuminated as she hurried through the twisting passageways . newline after a short distance she did nt even need her lamp anymore , torches lined the walls . newline the passageway came to an end , light flooded in through large openings in the walls . newline she stepped through , onto a large plateau . newline newline an unholy construction of wood , stone and rope towered in front of her . a goblin fortress . newline the fortress looked like the kind of thing that would fall apart through sheer force of whim . newline today it decided not to fall apart , so there it stood . spanning the full size of the massive cavern . newline she immediately hit the ground and crawled towards the ledge , eyes scanning over the fortress . newline hundreds of goblins patrolled every possible surface . newline shaky bridge ? a goblin patrolled it . newline tiny ledge ? a goblin patrolled it . briefly . newline they were nothing if not diligent in their duties . newline their movements had a computed rhythm to it . back and forth , back and forth . newline hannah s eyes rested on the one creature that moved not in a rhythm , but in the swaying movements of sheer panic . newline it ran in the direction of a large , fat creature sitting on a throne . newline newline the creature s shrill voice echoed through the walls of the the underground fortress ,  master , master !  it squealed ,  no more wine ! no more !  newline the large creature on the throne jumped to his feet as fast as you could imagine an impossibly fat creature would . newline  whaaaat ?  it belched ,  no more ! ?  newline the smaller creature jumped around in place , pointing at the upper rafters of the fortress ,  milk drinkers ! milk drinkers !  newline the large creature s jowls swayed as he swung his head towards the upper rows of the goblin fortress . newline he narrowed his beady little eyes , then gasped ,  there !  newline newline hannah s breath caught in her throat as she prepared to scream . newline her body deciding that breath would be better serviced running . newline it seemed sensible advice , she ran . newline she ran back through all the twisting passageways , goblins hot on her heels . newline sometimes there would be a fork in the road , she went left . sometimes right . newline at this point it did nt really matter to hannah where she went , anything better than here . newline newline she looked back over her shoulder at the approaching horde of goblins , then she slammed into something . newline hannah fell flat on her bum in a way that maidens in games are expected to do ,  fuck , that hurt .  she said , rubbing her butt . newline something maidens arent expected to do . newline the spirit of expectation felt cheated , there would be a complaint . newline newline terror gently tapped hannah on the shoulder , reminding her that she should be terrified . newline her head snapped upwards at the figure in front of her  the hero . newline newline she frantically pointed towards the end of the passageway ,  there s ... tthings ,  she managed ,  goblins ! big ones !  newline newline the hero craned his neck towards where she was pointing . he nodded . newline newline a warm light enveloped hannah . a renewed feeling of vitality

what ?  brody said . he looked around , startled . he had that thousand yard stare plastered onto his face . he looked like he had just woken from a nightmare and wasn  t sure if it was a dream or not . he looked down at the cigarette in his hand .  uh right . sorry.  newline newline  well , we haven  t heard from you in a while , chief ,  sarah said .  why don  t let us into your world . we  re all friends here.  newline newline  i  ve seen some shit ,  he said , taking another drag , as if he had already forgotten their conversation .  i  ve seen a grown man devoured by a shark before my very eyes quint was his name . a good man . he died for the safety of amity island . we killed the bastard , blew his goddamned head off  his voice trailed away , his eyes glazing over .  stay away from the water  newline newline  right , quint . you  ve brought him up before , brody.  newline newline  eleven hundred men went into the water  he muttered .  you know the thing about a shark he  s got lifeless eyes , black eyes , like a doll  s eyes.  newline newline  right ,  sarah said .  it  s good that you feel comfortable enough to talk about the event . i think talking helps us process our feelings now , i wanted to open up the group discussion to patrick bateman.  newline newline patrick sat in his immaculate , pinstripe suit , smiling pleasantly . newline newline  now we all know this is a support group for survivors of horror scenarios . in the literal sense are you a survivor of horror scenarios , although you were never the victim . in fact , you actually slaughtered dozens of people throughout their crime spree , brutally mutilating them without remorse so how does hearing a victim  s point of view make you feel ?  newline newline  i feel absolutely no emotions . i haven  t for years . my mind is cold and calculating . i have no empathy.  newline newline  right ,  sarah said , nodding .  it  s good that we can admit our shortcoming here . well , on that note , i say we end the session for today . detective sterling , i want you to bring in an object of sentimental value to kick off our next discussion . have a wonderful day everyone . we  ve all made wonderful progress.  newline newlinei look down at the child at my feet , his eyes wide and full of fear and wonder . newline newline  who who are you ?  he whispered , shaking though his feet are strong under him , and he holds his ground . newline newline  youngest of warriors , i am valkyrie . whom might you be ?  newline newline  my name is kurt wagner . i ... . i do nt feel right .  his eyes filled with tears as he looked at me , but his stance staid strong . newline newline yes , i would take him . odin help me , i see the strength that he would have had if he had been allowed to become a man . newline newline  young kurt , you are dead . can you tell me what happened ? do you understand how , young warrior ?  newline newline tears fell from his eyes .  mommy mommy said that it is our families job to protect those whom can not protect themselves . and ... . and david is only five , and they were hitting him with rocks !  newline newline  why did they do that ?  newline  david is different he talks funny , and everyone says he s broken cause his mommy made him that way . but mommy said that just because his mom tried to make him broken does nt mean he is , and that uncle kyle is like david , and she loves uncle kyle so ... .  newline newline i felt a small smile on my face , full of pride .  and young one , what did you do ?  newline newline  i drove my bike in front of david and made him run away ! ! i swing my helmet at the big kids they were being mean ! ! and i threw a rock back and it broke and they threw it back and it his my neck and and then there was a lot of red ... .  newline newline he got so , so quiet , my littlest of warriors .  but i was nt scared . i fell , and when i looked over , i smiled , because i saw david running away . and i saved him . i saved david .  newline newline  aye , little one , that you did . come ! ! we shall have to fit a special chair for you . the dwarves would love to help you ! shall we get you a sword , and axe , or something else ?  newline newline neither of them heard the screaming in the background . neither of them heard the wails of a mother having lost her only son as they entered the portal to valhalla . newline newline  can i have two swords ? !  newline newline i felt a hearty laugh leave me .  i , valkyrie , decree that you can try anything you like , and may have whatever feels the most right with you . how does one feel as one is rejuvenated ? it feels , i would say , quite like being licked by a corgi puppy . yes , it feels as if one is laying on one s bed in one s private chamber , with the morning s early light peering through the curtains , striking the oily portraits of edward iv , george iii and victoria , until it stirs the corgi puppies from their respite and those tiny darling creatures hop right up on one s bed and lick one s hand or neck . it is quite a joyful feeling , and , dare i say , an invigorating feeling . i do not know there is any other feeling on earth that quite compares to it . newline newline i confess i do not know quite for certain how it works , but nor do any of our top minds in the natural sciences or medicine or spirituality for that matter . i do suspect , however , that because the queen of england is chosen by god himself , then for this reason , prayers in the name of the queen of england are afforded great priority by the various angels and saints responsible for the effecting of prayer . so , when my subjects beseech that i live on and on and on , well , then i simply do . newline newline certainly i am not one to complain about being afforded such a grand gift as the hope of immortality . mortality is itself a curse , indeed , but immortality is in its own way a curse as well , since one who is immortal will in no sense ever measure one s achievements . but the hope of immortality is a splendid compromise because each year that i persist is an achievement i have earned and curated and in which i can take immeasurable pride . newline newline so , though i am not one to complain , i do wish that there was not the need for such subterfuge about it all . the daily routine of makeup and wigs is quite tiresome . furthermore , a woman and queen such as i should not be forced to hide the youth and beauty of her countenance from her public . though , i suppose it would be a cause of great alarm , were the people to see how i am not only alive , but perfectly preserved and vibrant . as i said , immortality with no costs is quite dreary , so i am gladdened by the challenge . newline newline what i am not gladdened by , however , is some young cunt thinking she can come into my bleeding palace and snatch away my affection from my subjects . a few too many  long live princess diana s  there were . a few too many indeed . so , she had to go . and go she did . right buggered off . newline newline i do so enjoy katherine though . so lovely and so dear . i very much hope she minds her place in my monarchy and i very much hope my subjects do not become , dare i say , overzealous in their blessings upon her .it is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw . the blade binds and pinches and if you do nt know where all the little bones come together you can get the blade stuck . the truth is it takes practice , everything does really but you never think about like that . newline newline there is a trick though . there often is , once you ve done a thing enough . the trick here was get a metal blade . not metal but a blade for metal . the smaller teeth while going slower kept a true path and do nt diverge as much as a wood blade s larger teeth . it goes slower of course , but if you are rushing this step you ve already lost . newline newline that was the key take your time . make all the pieces small enough to fit into the beetle containers where the little buggers could eat the flesh and leave the bone . then the furnace then the grinder then the bay . newline newline it was a trade that most people did nt know of , and most of those that did were on the other side of the law . that is they were law enforcement . newline newline it was a job though and if you were the right kind of man you could take pride in your work . afternoon , sigmund !  newline newline i glanced up from the mug i d been washing for the last three days at the peasant man across the room . he s my brotherinlaw , and he d been sitting at that same table since i opened my establishment three days ago . when i started washing the mug . he had nt actually ordered anything since his first ale , but he occasionally shouted greetings or compliments . bale was an odd fellow . newline newline  afternoon , bale !  i called cheerfully . newline newline the rowdy cockatrice had been my dream since i was a boy , and when the old innkeep moved on after the fire that burned down his tavern , i jumped at the opportunity to improve my situation . the family farm provided an ample supply of hops and barley , and my uncle , a merchant in the capital , offered me a premium on imported liqueurs . the construction of the building had been easy enough though for some reason i could nt get rid of the obnoxious glowing sign outside that just said  beta  in all capital letters . newline newline that , and not a single traveler had ever come through our town . only the occasional lonely merchant . newline newline there were four other peasants in the tavern , none of whom were interested in ordering a second drink . two were engrossed in a confusing card game in the corner . newline newline another day passed and i was almost ready to give up when the neon glow from the beta sign outside suddenly disappeared . i looked up but found myself unable to move my feet . and then , they appeared . newline newline dozens of burly men and elegant women barged through the front door at once , sometimes even phasing into one another when space ran out . all of them wore ornate armors from distant lands that must have been worth more than the entire village . and when they spoke , their words shimmered above their heads as if the gods wanted even the deaf to be able to hear them . newline newline  what s he got ?  asked one of the heroes to no one in particular . half a dozen of the warriors suddenly mobbed me , inquiring about my inventory . i proudly show off my wares , but none of them seem interested in my homebrewed ale or custom mead . one or two pay me handsomely for an entire bottle of liquor only to drink it on the spot or pour the entire container into some alchemical mix . newline newline  you play cards ?  one asks . i smile and nod , and pull out my deck . the room watches intently as the foreigner beats me at my own game . newline newline  was it fun ?  the heroes shout in unison . newline newline  still not as good as gwent ,  the victor grumbles . crestfallen , the heroes grumble along with him for a bit but continue in their revelry , splitting into groups based on armor color and clan affiliation . there s a dance circle on one of the tables every person is doing the same dance , but with slightly different timing . finally the attention turns back to me . newline newline  hey innkeep , what s the word on the street ?  asks the man who d beaten me in cards earlier . newline newline  you might talk to old woman ness up by the windmill ,  i say politely .  word is , some mysterious hooded figures have taken up residence in her family s ancestral estate and she s willing to reward whoever gets rid of them .  the hero grins and sprints out of the bar . before long , everyone in the place is clamoring to ask the same question . i send them all up to the mill . newline newline business booms for weeks , but eventually the adventurers  numbers dwindle . sometimes a nostalgic hero walks in to grab a bottle of liquor for one of their peculiar recipes , sometimes they just want to play cards . now and then i see a new face , or encounter a familiar personality of a totally different profession  like that necromancer who so reminded me of a ranger i d met  . newline newline the years pass and the rowdy cockatrice is forgotten . it s just me , bale , and the four other men now . none of us have moved . the mug still is nt clean . through the window i notice the days getting shorter and the world getting smaller . before long , the lights of the capital in the distance are gone and my shipments of spirits from my uncle stop arriving . the glowing sign reappears , this time heralding something called a  server shutdown  . newline newline and then it all ends . i m happy , i think . i lived the dream . but i wish i d gotten to see my wife again .i never missed . i never let things go to chance . and i never get discovered . newline newline but this new target was proving a little smarter than your average bear . newline newline or maybe , i mused as i reviewed my previous failed attempts , just luckier . newline newline the first time , i had used my standard plan . newline newline for the first two weeks , i studied her routine . it was pretty boring , as routines go . leave for work at 8:30 , come back at 6:00 , walk the dog at 8:00 , go to bed at 10:30 . i had no idea who wanted her dead , or why . but a job s a job , and half a million dollars is half a million dollars . newline newline i set up on the roof of her neighbor s house , a couple hundred yards away  fuck the country , it s hard to get work done there  . newline newline as usual , i used my modified .338 winmag with subsonic bullets to make the shot quieter . newline newline as usual , i stayed there for two days to make sure i had a good spot . newline newline as usual , i watched everything she brought into the house , just in case . newline newline a pet bird ? really ?  newline newline christ , you re not fooling anyone by flashing condoms everyone knows you have no chance with any sort of guy newline newline as usual , i took the shot as she came home , instead of left it more time until she s expected somewhere . newline newline i squeezed the 4pound trigger , the crosshairs lined up perfectly with her chest . newline newline the bullet flew straight , and i relaxed for the second and a half it d take to reach her . newline newline what the fuck ?  newline newline that goddamned bird had flown through an open windowshe always remembered to close her windows and right in front of the bullet . i knew enough to not take a second shot she d be looking for a gun . newline newline the second time , it was a car bomb c4 hotwired into the engine so it d blow when she turned the keys . newline newline i was nt enough of a dumbass to watch as it blew , so i went into her house and synced her cctv stream with a private youtube channel . lowlevel security , sure , but who the hell was she ? newline newline no one . she was no one and no one was looking out for her . newline newline i watched from my laptop as she strode out of the house . newline newline she walked up to her car , fumbled around in her purse , and walked back to her house she had forgotten her keys . newline newline whatever it s not like c4 has an expiration date , and i could always wait a little longer . newline newline well , as it turned out , little miss 500k had been parking in an illegal spot this entire time , and the 30 seconds it took for her to get her keys were the 30 seconds it took for a cop car to notice . newline newline she came outside the house to find a cop blocking her way and watched while her car got towed . newline newline this time , i would nt fail . my plan this time did nt involve guns or bombsor , at least , using them on her . i had found a very special place and knew exactly what to do with it . newline newline the fourth wall . behind which was the person responsible for foiling my plans . newline newline an mp5 , enough mre s to last a year and a water purification system were the only things in my pack . newline newline c4 had failed me once before , so i went a slightly stronger route . newline newline i had contacts in the government , but i would nt call them friends . newline i invited them over for a meeting . sadly , someone had laced their drinks with hypodermics and they were tied to chairs with a gun to their heads before they knew it . newline newline it was pretty easy to get the launch codes out of them , and by the next morning i had burned their bodies and was on my way to the white house . newline newline all government security is a joke . newline newline a bomb threat and a couple of warning shots got everyone down to the bunkers in a hurry , and i slipped into the sewer system and into the president s residence . newline newline of course , the bunker is where the launch terminal was , so i had to bust open the door . newline newline it was supposedly made of titanium . do nt make me laugh . newline newline the secret service sometimes have a scant idea of what they re doing , so it took me a couple minutes to kill them and take the president hostage in front of the cabinet . newline newline with one hand i kept a gun trained on the president and with the other i launched a loworder uranium bomb  can you believe we still use uranium bombs ? lucky for me though , otherwise i would nt have survived the detonation  at the fourth wall  which , naturally , was located in rome , texas  . newline newline i got out using the president as a human shield , killed him once we were out of dc , and headed to rome , texas . newline newline i had to steal a suit from the dod so i would nt get fried from the radiation , but that only delayed me half an hour or so . newline newline i walked right through the spot where the fourth wall used to be , and i saw the person who kept foiling my plans . newline newline  so , megan ,  i started in my best negotiating voice .  let s have a little talk , shall we ?  newline newline  wh who are you ?  she asked in a quivering tone . newline newline  oh , i think you know . you re the one who keeps stopping my attempts to kill ...  i paused for a moment . what was her name again ? it was always best to not know the name , sever any possible emotional connection . but sometimes i remembered .  jane .  newline newline she gasped .  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !  newline newline  what ?  i asked dispassionately . newline newline in between sobs and gasps for air , she managed to choke out ,  all i  sob  wanted to do was  sniffle  write a story about a girl who likes horses and  christ , these sobs are getting annoying  birds ! and then you kept changing my story and i had to change it so she does nt get hurt !  newline newline slowly i realized .  wait , so ... you re a little girl ?  newline newline she sneered .  you liked the act , huh ? no , bitch , i m not a little girl . i m a novelist writing a symbolist book and you keep fucking it up with your stupid onedimensional character ! i mean , sever any possible emotional connection ?  christ , your inner monologue sounds like a 12 yearold boy trying to sound cool !  newline newline  point taken ,  i conceded ,  but you know you have to let me kill jane .  newline newline  yeah , right .  newline newline  okay , you can stay up all night changing your book back from what i wrote . but eventually you ll miss something and keep writing , and your precious jane will stay dead . i need no food , nor oxygen , nor rent money . i live only on paper and i can keep fighting you forever . can you say the same ?  newline newline i was proud of that retort , and it must have shown , because the look on her face changed from a sneer to a frown for a second . but then i saw the scariest grin i ve ever seen , or will see . newline newline  goodbye , mister random hitman .  newline newline and with that , the sequence was pressed . newline newline  nooooooooooooooooooooo !  i screamed . but it was too late . newline newline controla newline newline delete newline newline controls newline newline and it faded to black . newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlineno one knew what was really out there , but we ve all heard the tales  or madeup our own . newline newline the cold breeze flowed through my hair as i sat on the roof of my apartment , nestled at the edge of the city but tucked away safely behind the wall . the light of the street lamps and the gross incandescence of the many skyscrapers could only reach so far out into the wild before it was consumed by the darkness . i stared into the deep dark , searching with my eyes to find any evidence of the stories we were told as children . the darkness was thick , milky , and serene , it seemed too peaceful , like an unnatural curse had devoured any light that dared touch it . it unnerved me and i could feel a sinister resonance pulsing from within the void . the inability to know what lied beyond frightened me to no end . i was afraid of this nothing . newline newline my worst fears waited for me in that darkness . newline newline i sighed and went back inside , my warm , protected , sanctuary . i was far far away from that darkness . newline newline i do nt want to know what waits within that darkness , and i do nt believe the tales that the others tell me . for now , i will just live my life and pretend that it is nt there . newline newline newline but that darkness will come for us all , eventually .one day a dad walked by another dad s yard . subconsciously territorial of his lawn , dad farted . dad 2 stopped in his tracks to swing his gut back around , having already passed dad on the sidewalk . dad 2 decided he was having none of that today . dad 2 stared at dad hard , trying to get a read on the situation . newline newline dad 2 planted his feet firmly on the sidewalk . in an attempt to gather himself , he took a slow , deep breath inward and closed his eyes , channeling the strength of his forefathers . when he opened his eyes he hit dad with a mighty fart of his own , accompanied with the finger gun gesture . he finger gun farted dad . newline newline taken aback , dad began to realize what was happening . this was nt just about his property , this was about making a stand for all things dad . his legacy was at stake . he was rattled , but far from beaten . dad looked within for some guidance , too , perhaps from his own dads of past . suddenly , he turned his rear towards dad 2 and bent over . with a mighty rumble , he unleashed a fart bomb with his hands mimicking the explosion motion from his rectum . newline newline dad 2 felt power of this movement , there was no doubt about it . both men were competitive by nature , but their primal brains were taking over at this point . newline newline dad 2 responded quickly with an air guitar fart , ripping off a gnarly toot while strumming a power chord , similar to his tribal acdc rituals . newline newline dad responded in kind with gatling gun tooties , even throwing in the  etetetetetet  machine gun sound effects . his ancestors would be proud . newline newline back to dad 2 . sumo fart stomps this time . leg up , thigh slap , thunder fart foot down . a strong display of dadism . newline newline dad s rebuttal was a unique move that would make even serena williams blush , the overhead fart smash . regardless of his inability to play tennis , the force was felt by dad 2 . newline newline they continued like this for hours . fart after glorious fart . only since the bean surplus of 1963 had there been such an epic showing of dadmanship . the alabama frisky , the deadman s last will and testament , the squirtle ... there was no move that would be off limits on this day . newline newline but dad 2 was running out of steam . thinking on the fly was not one of his strong suits . he was desperate for some kind of retribution . but he simply did not have enough beer and brats at his friend tbone s house to muster the ammo . his mojo was failing him . beleaguered , his next move would ultimately be his undoing . newline newline he arched his back in an attempt to perform the buffalo blaster , a move perfected by his kinsmen in upstate new york thousands of years ago . wobbly in his approach , he took three hard steps forward and attempted to kick his what would be an uninspiring fart in the direction of dad . but alas , wide right . newline newline dad had won . victiorious , he gave a fist pump as if he had just won the super bowl , or his boss bought his  i m sick and ca nt come in today  shtick . this was a win for the ages . newline newline dad 2 sighed , defeated . a sad day for his family indeed . surely he would be shamed by having to take the girls to swim practice or rake leaves all day . no punishment could have been worse enough in his mind . newline newline so is the saga of two dads and their heroic dadoff .15yearold jason martin has been living with his paternal grandparents since his parents divorced two years ago . like many other grandparents , joe and martha loved to spoil their grandson . newline newline jason was especially close to joe as they had many common interests , such as fishing , hunting , going to movies and playing video games . joe was somewhat out of the loop with video games due to the generation gap , but he nonetheless did his best to enjoy them with his grandson . newline newline like many other kids his age , jason had the latest and greatest xbox 360 games . he and joe especially loved playing skyrim together . the guitar hero and rock band games were a little too much for joe s notsonimble fingers , but he did his best to have fun  even though that meant losing terribly . the premise of portal 2 was too confusing for 65yearold joe , so he mostly just watched . however , whenever jason started up a call of duty title , joe would get up and head to his room . newline newline jason did nt think much of it at first until he noticed his grandfather leaving every time he started playing a call of duty game . one day , he decided to invite joe for a game to see what would happen , and he went to knock on joe s door . newline newline  come on in !  newline newline  what s up , grandpa ?  smiled jason .  i was wondering if you d like to play some call of duty : black ops 2 with me .  newline newline  come over here , my boy .  joe motioned for jason to sit with him on his bed .  there s something i ve been wanting to tell you for some time .  newline newline jason was a bit puzzled .  yeah ?  newline newline  there s a reason i do nt like shooting games very much .  newline newline  why s that ?  newline newline  son , do you know what ptsd is ?  newline newline just then , jason realized why his grandfather did nt like those games . he suddenly remembered that joe had served in the vietnam war , and had seen some rather nasty things overseas .there were so many thoughts that ran through my mind in that moment . a lifetime of sins , a lifetime of people who had suffered at my hands . whether it was from the bullying , ignoring them , or something unintentional . almost everyone who had crossed my past was hurt in the wake that i had left behind . newline newline but one person was hurt above all else , no matter what she did there was no way to change it . her son had torn the family apart , ruined the safety of their home by bringing in his friends , his addictions , he had tainted it all ! newline newline after considering the sins to erase , i realized that there was but a single choice . as i moved the marker , feeling it get heavier and heavier , or maybe i was just getting weaker and weaker , i felt the last moment of release . my body was swept away as tears rolled down my cheeks . newline newline my worst sin was my existence .jacob had witnessed the death of a stranger less than 24 hours ago , and his decidedly dull life had taken a surprising turn . newline yesterday afternoon jacob had been walking apathetically through the local mall . he had intended to buy a new button down , but ended up purchasing a bag of candy and a dog toy for his pup , rufus . he tossed another gummy bear into his mouth , and chewed it slowly , trying to decide if he wanted to bother with the shirt or just go home and take a nap . newline newline a woman bustled past him , clearly in a rush , she was laden with shopping bags and when she passed jacob one of her bags slammed into his candycarrying arm . gummies , m  ms and gumballs flew all over the place . the woman did nt even stop . jacob threw her a nasty look , and bend to recover his now ruined candies , debating weather the 5 second rule applied to floors with such heavy traffic . as he knelt , he was afforded an excellent vantage point of the lower floor of the mall , he watched the people pass and absentmindedly picked up the sugary mess . then it happened , a man in a red tee shirt stumbled when he was near the bottom of the escalator , his pant leg was being pulled into the mechanism and it dragged him down . his head hit the edge of the escalator stairs , again and again , until someone yanked him away by now jacob was staring , mouth agape . the man was covered in blood , were people running around with their phones  recording the incident , calling 911 , snapping pictures . newline newline jacob decided he had seen more than enough , abandoned the candy , and made his way quickly to the exit . that night he dreamed of being eaten by an evil staircase , everything was red , and candy littered the floor . at 3am , his phone dragged him out of his nightmare newline  hhello ?  jacob asked , clearing his throat newline  excellent work , agent t , your target has been neutralized . call at 0600 for your next mission .  a woman s voice told him , then the call ended abruptly . newline jacob lay in bed dumbfounded , his sleepy brain was trying to process what had just happened .  must have been a prank call..  he thought , turning his phone on silent and settling back down to sleep . newline newline jacob rolled out of bed at 10am , he had to be at work in an hour . grabbing his phone he saw he had twelve missed calls all from an unknown number , starting at 6am , three calls every hour until newline jacob s phone buzzed in his hand , it was an unknown number . newline  hello ?  newline  agent t , where have you been ? this behavior is unacceptable , but unprecedented , so it will be our secret . your next target has been assigned , information regarding their whereabouts , schedule and other pertinent information will be sent to you after this call .  newline  who is agent t ? is this some kind of prank ?  jacob asked , growing more concerned by the moment . but it was too late , the mystery woman had already hung up . his phone buzzed again , jacob stared down at it , and saw a notification from an app he has never installed  secure send..  he read the name aloud , he tapped  read  and waited for the screen to load . moment later , a mugshot of a woman appeared on his screen , she looked oddly familiar but jacob was too anxious to figure out how he knew her . beneath the picture was the woman s information : newline  name : brenda marie jones newline newline  codename :  sandy  newline newline  sex : f newline newline  age : 27 newline newline  height : 54  newline newline  weight : 115lbs . newline newline  hair color : blonde newline newline  eye color : brown newline newline  race : caucasian newline newline he kept scrolling , skimming the woman s usual daily schedule , which seemed innocuous enough , a thorough list of all her relatives full names and addresses , then he saw it : newline  current location : bean culture , 45 sandlake st. newline newline jacob gasped , that was less than three blocks away from his home . newline newline  mission : detain and await further instruction newline newline jacob stared at his phone , hoping the mystery woman would call him back , explain to him this was one big misunderstanding . something told him that the woman , and whomever she worked for , would nt give him a chance to explain their error and the depth of information they had on this brenda woman was frightening enough to spur him on to bean culture . newline newline jacob pushed the door open and the little bell chimed merrily , jacob resented it s cheerfulness . having no better ideas , he ordered a black coffee and sat down . his phone buzzed in his pocked , and he snatched it out praying that it was the mystery woman . no such luck , it was work . newline  jake ! where are you ? your shift started 10 min ago !  his manager s voice yelled newline  i m uh.. i m not feeling good .  he said , lamely newline  call ahead next time , jeez .  with that his manager hung up . jacob was too distracted to care he was scanning the coffee shop for brenda . newline his eyes landed on a blond woman who was facing a wall , she was near the back typing furiously on a laptop . jacob abandoned his coffee and approached quietly , taking the empty seat beside her . newline  hey sandy   he said quietly , not knowing what had come over him  i m going to need you to come with me .  he mimicked all the cop shows he d ever seen newline brenda s fingers stopped moving , her body went ridged newline  and why is that ?  her voice betrayed a hint of fear , and jacob was encouraged newline  i think we both know why , brenda .  jacob said , smoothly newline she had nt looked away from her screen during their entire exchange , and jacob whispered  your parents , rob and linda jones , live at 657 north parr street . your sister , ashley jones , lives at 87 french boulevard , unit 6 . your aunt  newline  okay , okay .  brenda cut him off , and jacob was filled with relief , he could nt remember her aunt s name or address . newline  quickly pack up your things , give them to me , and we will walk out of here slowly and calmly .  jacob instructed her , in a voice that he did nt recognize as his own . newline brenda did as she was told , and when they were out on the street jacob realized he had no idea where to take her . luckily his phone buzzed in his pocket , he extracted it and tried to appear calm . newline  another job well done , agent t ! a car should be arriving..now .  newline a black town car with heavily tinted windows pulled up , the left side door opened and brenda got in and the car pulled away . jacob stood there dumbly , still holding brenda s things , the woman on the phone broke his reverie . newline  are you still there agent t ?  newline  um , yeah..  jacob said slowly , wondering if he had just lead a woman to her death newline  on to your next  newline  wait ! i m not agent t. i never was , i do nt know who you are or how you got my numb  newline the woman cut him off with a bark of laughter newline  you are agent t. check your phone after this call . i ll give you the rest of the day off.. and check your bank account .  newline she hung up , and jacob s phone buzzed it was secure send again he tapped read and was met with this message : newline  jacob wethers , newline welcome to the industry . you have been selected based on your observed characteristics . the industry has been watching you for a number of years and we are delighted to finally welcome you to the team . we set up the death of the man in the red shirt , and deployed  sandy  , your reactions and behaviors have shown us that our choice was correct . your code name is agent t , we encourage you to not worry about what the t  stands for . you will be given missions via your phone each day . more information on the industry can not be found online , and it will be a number of years before you are cleared to enter headquarters . newline all the best , newline agent x newline newline jacob reread the message twice , his head spinning : they had been watching him ? for years ? he was an agent for some company called the industry ?  sandy  was nt real ? newline then he remembered what else the woman on the phone had said , and quickly pulled up his banking app . newline  checking..  500,000 newline newline  savings ...  500,000 newline newline he stared down at the numbers , his head was spinning . maybe being agent t was nt going to be so bad after all . newline newline edit : formatting , and to say i know this does nt quite fit the prompt , hopefully that s okay . newline wait . this ca nt be right ! the universe was supposed to be expanding faster than the speed of light , it was not supposed to be possible for us to hit a dead end !  the captain said angrily . newline newline  captain , we are yet to confirm this is the end of it . our data does indeed show that we are not moving , but what we see is not quite different from we saw all this time  darkness . there must be something else going on here , it s not like we hit some hard border .  said the assistant calmly . newline newline  you are wrong , peter . we used to see stars up until now , even if they are very distant you can still see them looking from the window on the back , and now it s just.. nothing . how very disappointing . i must admit , i was hoping that there will be an edge of the universe , that we will stop seeing the same old things over and over again.. all these galaxies , with their boring stars and planets.. i am so sick of them , i was really hoping to find something beyond my wildest imagination if i ever get to the edge of the universe.. i wo nt accept this , peter , i will see what s beyond it even if i have do it with my own muscles  said captain frank and jumped outside of the ship in his space suit , heading toward the tip of the ship . newline newline  captain , wait , captain ! that s dangerous !  yelled peter , but captain frank was already outside . newline newline  just listen , peter , remember my every word . whatever happens must be recorded !  said frank , reached the tip of the ship and proceeded to push himself against the invisible resistance.. and he.. did it ! he managed to break through darkness to see what he never expected to see .  peter , are you listening ? i do nt know how to tell you this , but i see.. 0s..  newline newline  0 s , captain ?  asked peter baffled . newline newline  0x000000  to be more precise.. what the hell is going on.. i will take a closer look.. oh shit..  said the captain , with a soft voice filled with the acceptance of his fate . newline newline  frank ? frank ! what s going on ?  peter started panicking . newline newline  well , in the end i could nt see how the end looks like , but now i know how the beginning loo..  captain s voice cut before being able to finish his sentence . newline newline bell rings newline newline  save your work and you are free to go . next week we will take a look at how multiple inheritance affects our simulations . have a nice weekend everyone  . newline newline  umm , mr. parker , i am sorry i will make you stay late again , but i think i messed up big time  said johnny in an apologetic voice . newline newline  that s okay , john , i like your enthusiasm for this class  said the teacher and went to take a look at johnny s computer . newline  stack overflow exception ? come on , john , you are better than this . forgetting the base case is an amateurish mistake , you know you are supposed to check if they reached the edge , if you do nt , the entire thing will start all over again , just like your case . and you manipulated the constants to allow them reach the edge , did nt you ? they were not supposed to be able to do that in the first place . also , i told you before , black holes are a lazy way for garbage collection . your enthusiasm makes you a fastlearner , but it seems the cost is a buggy code . oh well , at least you have a bright future as a game developer , you are not afraid of killing and destruction , gamers love these things . let s leave fixing these issues for next time , alright ? come a little earlier for next class  . newline newline  i will , mr. parker , thank you . and have a nice weekend !  . newline newline  you too , john  .the ancestors said that originally humans ate meat but after the animals were destroyed , it wasn  t safe to eat them . lucia licks at her lips , watching the fat bird waddle around . it doesn  t match the description of a  turkey  as she saw in the books but that might be a mutation from it being out alone on the planet . her thin , shaking hands hold a sharp knife and in the other , a net . newline newline  come on.  amzi mutters to her .  you wanted to try this , see if we can do what the old ones used to . it  s the only option otherwise , there  s no food out here.  his eyes are fixed on the bird . newline newline  you have the fire set up ?  lucia attempts to distract her mind . amzi nods in response . lucia carefully steps forward . years of avoiding the big things had trained their people well in the art of sneaking . if you weren  t able to sneak , you were eaten or killed . newline newline the bird doesn  t notice her presence until it  s too late . the net  s dropped over its head and she lands on it with her full weight with a cry . amzi is close beside her right afterward , helping her pin the thing down and lucia plunges the blade between the netting and into the creature  s throat . blood coats the feathers and blade as the turkey struggles for only a short time longer . newline newline blood makes a mess around and on them , amzi helping her heft the bird up and back towards their camp as fast as possible in their weakened states . lucia licks at the blood on her hand , wondering if the blood is drinkable . they weren  t getting much in the way of water with how far off track they were . newline newline  what do we do to cook it ? is it like a squash ?  lucia questions as she licks more of the blood off her hand . it doesn  t taste particularly nice , in fact , it  s a little salty , but there has to be some sort of water content in it . newline newline  pluck it and cut the head off i think.  amzi looks a little nervous .  i can do that . you snuck up on it real nice.  newline newline  you better do it . i  m not doing all the work.  lucia snorts as they reach their raggedy campsite . amzi chuckles at her response before dropping the dead bird onto a section of cleared dirt and getting to work . newline newline it takes longer than either of them expected and lucia ends up helping more anyways before they  ve got the creature up on the spit to roast . they stare at it , amzi occasionally turning it as they shiver with the daylight starting to fade . eventually , lucia breaks into the crackling noises the fire is making . newline newline  when  s it done ?  newline newline  ii have no idea ,  amzi admits , continuing to turn the creature on the spit .  it said something about smelling it if i remember correctly . i think it was a long time though.  newline newline  how long ? are we going to starve to death before it  s cooked ?  lucia scowls . her mood has been getting worse for the last few days with the lack of food and water . newline newline  i don  t think so.  amzi shakes his head , eyes still focused on the spit with the roasting bird . they lapse into silence , watching the bird cook as amzi slowly turns it . lucia shuts her eyes and places her head on her knees , trusting that he knows or remembers what he  s doing . newline newline the smell wakes her , her mouth salivating at the scent . amzi is still turning the spit but lucia sees a similar expression on his face . she traces it back to the bird hanging over the fire . the outside has turned brown , almost crispy looking . newline newline  is is it done ?  amzi shakes his head in response . newline newline  i don  t think so . it hasn  t been long enough . maybe i need to turn it faster.  newline newline  can we eat the outside ?  lucia  s mouth continues to water as she stares at the cooking food .  then you can keep cooking the insides.  newline newline  i don  t think it works that way.  amzi gives a quiet laugh , spinning the spit a little faster . they lapse into silence again as he continues turning the spit faster . lucia watches it intensely , counting every second as the meat drips , making the fire sizzle and pop loud . she watches the outside change to a darker shade of brown . small spots of black begin to show up in certain areas . newline newline  amzi come on . it  s got to be done . there  s like black on the outside in spots.  there  s a pause before he nods his consent , licking his lips . his gaze is intensely focused on the bird . they move the spit setup away from the fire and both of them eye it . newline newline lucia moves first , grabbing one of the legs and pulling at it . it pops off the body , dropping a couple chunks of meat to the ground , and she takes only a short pause before biting into it . amzi copies her example , yanking the other leg off similarly and biting into it . they stay quiet for a while , chewing and considering the taste . newline newline  it  s like the soybeans but different.  amzi finally speaks after swallowing . lucia nods , simply biting into the leg more , chewing and swallowing rather quickly .  i hope we don  t get sick.  newline newline  i  d rather be full and feeling ill rather than starving to death.  lucia scowls .  at least sick means i  m alive probably thanks to this thing.  she continues chewing on the leg until amzi gets her attention . he looks frightened . newline newline  a a  his voice is barely even a whisper . lucia puts her hand on her knife and turns as she draws it , taking a defensive position in front of the roasted bird . there  s a wolf there , ears slightly floppy and it  s sniffing curiously about , staying just at the edge of the firelight . lucia remembers her lessons , about just giving her food up to what had originally been their companions . newline newline instead , she snarls , fronting and defending the area . there  s no way she  s giving this meal up after they  ve been starving . another wolf steps out of the woods as the first jumps back . lucia bites more off the turkey leg before throwing it at them . it hits one of the wolves , making them jump and disappear into the darkness of the woods . newline newline they return quickly however , one snatching up the turkey bone and beginning to gnaw on it . the second starts a fight with the first for the bone until another one lands in their midst , amzi having thrown his to them . the second wolf pounces on the thrown leg and they edge back away into the dark . the sound of crunching bones and chewing echoes back . lucia turns her attention back to the turkey , taking her knife and cutting a chunk off . newline newline  well.  lucia starts , stuffing the chunk into her mouth .  that  ll keep them busy for a little bit at least.  newline newline  i think i can set up some torches to flash at them to keep them away.  amzi nods as he rips a piece off with his fingers and eats it .  at least now that we  ve got some time.  newline newline  let  s do it really quick.  lucia turns her attention to some of the nearby branches to keep the fire going . amzi wipes his fingers on his pants and nods , joining her . newline newline  newline newline this ended up super long and i wanted to almost keep writing on it lol . i went with a slightly different idea as to what happened with the animals and the colony .season 8 begins with barney and robin getting together and married . ted is depressed . after the wedding , he meets the mother . flash forward into the future . turns out the mother pulled a mosby on their first date . ted proposes soon after . lily gladly accepts the money marshal owes her for losing the bet . barney and robin are off having tons of fun , making fun of ted for having such a boring life when he announces that him and the mother are having a child . newline newline  and that , kids , is how i met your mother ,  ted says . newline newline the mother then walks in and sits right next to him . newline newline  did you guys seriously just let your dad tell you that story ?  the mother asks . newline newline  yeah , he told us it would be short ,  the kids whined . newline newline  honey , you ve got to get going to work , right ?  the mother asks . newline newline  yep ,  ted says with a big smile before kissing her . he then gets up and leaves . newline newline we see a shot slowly fading away from the room . one of the pictures is actually bob saget and the mother , as a nice little cameo . newline newline  so , seeing as though you re already here kids ,  the mother begins ,  why do nt i tell you how i met your father .  newline newline the last scene is of the kids sighing and lying back in defeat as the mother begins her story . newline newline  newline newline alternative : newline newline  and that , kids , is how i met your aunt robin ,  modern ted said . newline newline  wait , what ?  the kids shouted in unison . newline newline  no , i m just kidding ,  ted chuckles .  that s how i met your mother , robin .  newline newline  newline newline yet another alternative : newline newline season 8 begins with barney and robin getting together and getting married and ted is depressed . we still have no knowledge of the mother . ted goes on a series of dates to try to get over robin , but none end well . newline newline flash forward to the series finale at the end of season 8 . barney and robin are getting married . ted rushes in to stop the wedding in some dramatic way proclaiming his love for robin . some large , romantic and overblown speech goes down betwen ted and robin , ending with robin tearing up , aplogizing to barney , and running away with ted . meanwhile , barney wipes the sweat off of his brow , relieved . newline newline additionally , marshall looks over at lily and holds out his hand with a big smile . lily then plops a  5 in his hand . he won the bet . ted and robin all the way . newline newline now we see modern ted talking to his kids . newline newline  wait , was nt this supposed to be how i met your mother , not how i met your step mother ?  the kids ask in disbelief . newline newline  oh , yeah , um ...  ted stumbles . newline newline  you just wanted to tell us how you met robin , did nt you ?  the kids say , staring in disbelief . newline newline  guilty ,  ted responds .  you know how i was depressed about robin marrying barney . it turns out one of the girls i dated ended up pregnant . so that s how i met your mother ,  he says as he looks towards his daughter . newline newline  wait , why are you only looking at her ?  the son says . newline newline  oh , well i guess the cat s out of the bag ,  ted says .  you re adopted .  newline newline que a nice slideshow of everything that happened in between ted winning robin s heart and him talking to his kids .the trip seemed endless , but of course the drugs in my system to avoid the effects of ftl travel might have made my dreams seem more intense and my waking hours a bit foggy . i remember telling the flozzie loadmaster to disembark any triskeran that looked too far cromulent to snag with the hold s udderlines , but that may have been a gravity induced dream during yet another stop on the local route to san tiber . i knew i should have taken the express when another damn hopgo took the flask next to mine , and started emitting that pathetic squelchy noise preparatory to mitosis on their species  grand scale . newline newline but the inflight vidscans were new , at least to me , and i got to see the first reports about the new human colony on lepteros . pity about the spores , there , but a more thorough examination of the planet would have cost too much to bear , and now we knew to avoid the place . maybe the hopgo would buy it from us . newline newline eventually i would get to the end of my trip . another day in paradise , another load delivered to the shunlight masters , tomorrow another load to carry . and then i would see if the pahtheric had worked on my darling while i was gone . i got my shotgun out of my carryon bag before i went in the front door of my house , just in case . you want me to do what ? !  i exclaimed . newline newline  it  s very simple : i want you go to the democratic rally and cause a big fuss . jump up on the podium if that  s what it takes . in fact , that  s not such a bad idea . in fact , it  s a great idea.  newline newline oh god i thought as he continued . newline newline  tomorrow , you  re going to go to the sanders rally , and you  ll go as something unusual , an animal maybe.  he sat in his chair of gold and thought for a moment longer . i saw this as my opportunity to put in my two cents . newline newline  sir , if i may , i don  t think this is the best way to sabotage our opponents.  newline newline he sat up straighter in his chair .  you don  t know what a great idea is . i  m great at making great ideas . everyone who  s told me my ideas are terrible , i  ve given them the bird.  he paused and leaned back .  that  s it . you  re going as a pet bird . you  ll get the audience  s attention . then you  ll fly up to the podium , do a little song and dance , and everyone will forget what bernie was talking about.  newline newline i pondered this longer than i really needed to . he loves to be flattered , and one way i do this is to consider his ideas for a while , then agree to them , no matter how crazy they were .  what do i get out of it ?  i asked him . newline newline  i  ll give you a million dollars if you pull it off.  newline newline i  m a professional . i always pull it off . newline newline  it ll be done , mr. trump.  i said as i left to complete my mission .i was polishing my sword when i heard the tent flaps rustle behind me . newline newline  come in ,  i said , as i turned to greet the late night visitor . newline newline malena appeared at the entrance . her dark hair was free and she was not wearing her seers  sash . she stood there with an inscrutable expression on her face . her gaze moved around my tent , scanning over my belongings , weapons and books , before resting finally on my face . some sentiment in her eyes intensified , but she did not speak . newline newline  i can never sleep well after battle ,  said i , breaking the unusual , rather tense silence that had set between us . newline newline she nodded .  i know . i was expecting to find you awake . they want to speak to you .  with that , she left the tent , and i followed quickly behind . newline newline the other seers were seated around a tall pillar of white fire a little way away from the tents . the bright light flickered on their grim features , and their voices died away as we approached . there was a sweet , delicate smell in the air , the same scent as malena s clothes , skin and hair . newline newline raelen spoke , his deep voice barely a whisper .  we congregate to uncover the way , the true path , to find the signs that lead us away from the darkness . we did so tonight , and our visions were ... disturbing , yet we saw them with clarity and certainty .  he paused and i looked to malena for some reassurance . none came , and a knot tightened in my chest . how many more were to die ? what other suffering would come over these lands , to plague people who deserve no such pain ? i would stop it , i would put an end to the misery and darkness . had nt i , many months ago , pledged my life and my soul to do so . newline newline raelen continued .  we are instruments of a force we barely understand . the fire led us to you . we do not know if we misinterpreted , or if in finding you we fulfilled some higher purpose . tonight , the fire shows us that there is another meant for this destiny we have believed to be yours . you are not the one called to this journey . your path lies elsewhere .  there was a bitter note of frustration in his tone .  and we have a difficult , and much longer way ahead of us .  newline newline  tomorrow morning , you will be given an escort and supplies to return to your village ,  said gresna .  you will receive compensation for your services to this great cause , and for the light that you have brought to the world .  newline newline i could sense that i was being dismissed . his last words blurred in my mind . i walked back to my tent , my heart pounding and my feelings alternating rapidly between disbelief , anger , and sheer numbness . throughout this mire , one little thought took hold in my mind . it grew , fuelled by hope that began appearing increasingly reasonable . they were wrong . had nt i defeated the shreevers at yotte hill ? had nt i united the five provinces ? had nt i shown magic previously unknown ? the prophecy described me . i was certain . newline newline when i reached my tent i started packing . i had no intention of returning to my village . i d leave tonight , quickly . i took weapons and a few books , even though they were not mine . in my rush , i did not hear malena enter . newline newline  you are leaving ,  she said softly . newline newline  i am ,  i said resolutely . newline newline  return to your village ,  said malena . her eyes were pleading .  please , sebastian . leave this country . you have been given this chance .  newline newline i put my hands on her shoulders and meeting her eyes , i asked ,  why ? what is coming ?  newline newline malena shook her head . she pressed her head on my chest and wrapped her arms around me . newline newline  they are wrong . this is my calling .  newline newline  they are not wrong . i am the one who saw it ,  she said , her voice muffled slightly .  leave this place , sebastian . i do nt know how much i can help you anymore . i already betrayed my vows .  she released me and looked away . newline newline  you have not . you said yourself your attachment to me was nt encouraged , but is not against the vows .  newline newline she did not reply . she stood there , unmoving and silent , as i finished packing . i could not see her face . newline newline  it makes no difference if i am the chosen one or not . i will do what i can for this world .  newline newline  i am coming with you ,  she whispered . newlineyou were truly the best enemy i could ever ask for . you were the reason i wanted to stay alive . there was no way i could ever contemplate leaving town while you were roaming the streets tempting unsuspecting people with your smile and personality . i should know , i was one of them . if it was nt for me , you would nt be in that position of power . you used me as a stepping stone . newline newline i could nt sleep at night knowing you were preparing for your next attack . without sleep , i had time to spare . i began to write about you and i wrote some more . i spammed forums , warning others of you . i gave specific details on what you look like and the scripted words that would come out ,  it s okay . it s fine .  but , to my horror , that was nt enough . the more i warned others , the more entranced they became and they began searching for you . newline newline oh , what have i done . no one deserves to go through what i did , and yet , it was i would sent them down your path . what a fool am i . you have made me a part of your plan , i despise you for that . newline i no longer have the energy to swear . i give up and will follow your lead . newline newline you , delicious pizza . enemy of my weight loss plan , of the healthier version of me . take my money and come to me . you are truly the best enemy i could ever ask for . yeah ... uh huh  newline eugene shoved herbert away from him and gave him the finger before hanging up the phone . every time he talked to his wife at work this guy would try and mess with him  this time it was air humping eugene as he tried to ask his wife to pick up the dry cleaning newline newline newline  so seductive  he said as he left the room and headed to the parking lot . newline on his way home he got a phone call from his daughter , upset that she did nt get to go on the field trip with her class to wonka  s boutique . newline newline newline  i ll take you to the candy shop  he said in his best soothing voice , but haley was in hysterics ,  i ll let you lick the lollipop !  newline newline newline  go ahead !  he shouted at the woman trying to cut in front of him , some people just should nt be allowed on the roads , newline  girl , do nt you stop !  shouted the passenger of the minivan also waiting to his left , damn southerners , eugene thought as he checked his watch . newline  keep going til you hit the spot !  the exasperated minivan driver yelled in a shrill voice . newline newline newline  whoa !  newline gene had had enough , he just wanted to get home and see his family , he swerved into the opposite lane and zoomed past the minivan . newline what a mildly irritating experience ... newlinedeep bellow the earth , in an old cript , a wizard was chanting strange words of ancient language . every now and then he would take a break and talk in human language . being in the dark for to long has giving him the habit of talking to himself . newline newline  only a few more minutes . after all these years it will finally be done .  his voice was rough and raspy . seemed like the life down here has dried his lungs out . newline newline weird noises could suddenly be heard in the distance , ecchoing through the old cript and yellow dust was falling from the ceilling , as the ground trembled . newline newline  have they finally discovered me . they are to late . after all these years , of eating nothing but rat meat , i can not let myself be stopped .  newline newline the weird noises suddenly turned into words , that were spoken in a high pitched tone . it was clear , the feminist were coming . the feminist were here to stop the fedora overlord , that has sweared to ruin their life . newline newline  they wanted equallity , thinking they can run around with their disgusting saggy tits hanging out .  newline newline the mage laughed as he tipped his fedora and then proceeded to stroke his neckbeard . in the darkness of the cript , the womans were barely visible , but the mage noticed them instantly , when they stood in front of him . newline newline  stop right there !  the high pitched scream of the woman ecchoes through the cript and the mage laughed in response . it was already to late . a light suddenly filled the room , it was done , it couldnt be stopped anymore . the mage was still laughing , but as the light revealed the woman , he chocked on his own breath . newline newline  monster !  he screamed . newline newline the woman were fat and ugly , with pimples spread across their faces . their hair was oily and salivia was dripping down their mouth , as if they had seen the most delicious steak ever . newline newline the light disappeared and the mage broke down onto his knees . tears flowing down his face and snot coming out of his nose . when he saw the woman , that one could easily mistake for a beast , he realised he should have never casted the spell . newline newline  you complained about not being able to run around topless , so i casted this spell , which prevents girls from putting on their clothes . but i didnt expect woman to turn into such abdominations .  newline newline the mage revealed a small knife , and cut of his neckbeard , he didnt want to live in a world like this . newline newline through scientific advances , in a lot of fields , especially in the medical ones , the human population turned into lazy pigs , that barely move . newline newline  lol , this shit mate .  newline newline random friend newline newlinehe handed me the gun as we were standing outside . i looked at him befuddled as he brandished his own gun in his hand , spinning it around evilly . newline newline  what the hell , matt ? !  i said upset . newline newline matt was my best friend since the 5th grade , at least until recently . we were both outcasts and were bullied but we handled it much differently . i drowned myself in my own activities while he kept to himself . what i did nt know was that he was plotting for weeks to do this . we had nt talked for months , but he started talking with me again this past week , which was strange . little did i know ... newline newline we were heading back inside after a fire drill when matt stopped me just outside the door . he told me he had a surprise for me and reached into his bag . that was when he handed me the gun . newline newline  i ca nt do this alone ... this was the surprise i had for you  he said grinning  finally we ll take our revenge on everyone who picked on us . tommy . sharon . hunter . madison . all of them . we can finally make our vengeance be known !  newline newline  you ve got the wrong girl  i said trying to hand the gun back newline newline  you ca nt back out now ... .  he said as he pushed the gun back towards me .  i gave you this gun because i trusted you . i trusted that you d have my back like you did last year at the playground  newline newline  that was different . i was just punching tommy so that he d leave you alone . he may be a jerk , but i do nt want him to die or anything . besides , his little sister mabel is pretty cool .  newline newline  but do nt you remember what he called you last week in gym class ? said that you were a freak and teased you because you did nt have your period yet . oh and do nt forget his girlfriend who calls you a lesbo everytime she sees you  newline newline  she wishes . she talks about tits in the locker room more than most dudes  i said sardonically  but that does nt mean that i want to kill them . look , matt , this is nt the right answer .  newline newline  then what is ?  and it was at that moment when i realized that this was nt matt anymore . this was a stranger who had taken over matt s body . he had become so consumed with his negative thoughts that he had become someone else entirely newline newline  you re such a fucking bleeding heart coward ... looks like i have no choice .  he said coldly newline newline my hands were getting sweaty as the gun weighed down on me . matt looked at me with sympathy and soon raised his gun up at me , ready to shoot . by this time , students from neighboring classes had made their way towards any available window to see what was going on . teachers were cautiously heading towards the door where matt and i were outside of . matt s eyes were steely as he pointed the gun at me . newline newline  matt ... please ...  i pleaded newline newline  it s the only way  he said as he started to pull the trigger . newline newline suddenly , i saw a look flicker onto his face . it was like his real self had managed to bust out through all the mental illness , the angst , and hate that had made him the intimidating stranger that stood before me . he looked at me with those grayish green eyes as tears began to form in his eyes . his face looked conflicted as he stared at me . he mouthed no ... .  before i shut my eyes and bowed my head to the ground newline newline i dropped the gun that had still been in my hand all this time . i was ready to meet my fate . if this was how it was going to be , i was going to face it with dignity . just as the male teachers took off outside to intervene , i heard the gunshot ring out in the air . my eyes are still closed , as i wondered where the bullet went into my body . as the sound of the gunshot dissipates into thin air , i can barely hear the screams of my fellow classmates . moments pass and yet , i ca nt feel a thing . newline newline i feel my history teacher s hand on my shoulder as he tries to bring me back down to earth . i fluttered my eyes open and realize that i am alive . i then looked up and saw matt s body crumpled onto the ground , laying in a pool of his own blood and other body parts i d rather not think about . when i snapped back to reality i was shaking uncontrollably . my history teacher asked me if i was okay and the only thing i could say was  i wan na go home  newline newline in the coming weeks , i was lauded as a hero . they all said if it was nt for me , the shooting could ve been worse . if it was nt for my reasoning , he would ve rushed in without hesitation and killed a ton of people . from then on , i was never picked on again . i suppose that was nt so bad . years have passed and it still lives on through legend in the hallways . i was known as the pintsize pacifist  i had nt gone through my growth spurt at the time  . newline newline everybody thinks of matt as a psycho loser , a statistic , or yet another psa about mental health and gun control , but i do nt think of him like that . he was my best friend before the dark thoughts consumed him and changed him into a stranger . that stranger may have tried to kill me , but it was matt who gave me a chance at life at the expense of his own . and for that , i owe him my life .what is sentience ? for centuries it was a measurement of an entities intelligence . over the past decade it was a goal , a criteria to be met . we ve had  artificial intelligence  for a long time now but only recently were we able to compare it with our selves . roughly ten years ago we had designed a machine ,  the architect  . the purpose of  the architect  was to develop plans for a sentient machine ,  the mind  . the plans created by  the architect  were beyond human comprehension , we would receive the plans and begin construction without any indication of what fruits the product might bear . the first three iterations of  the mind  were flawed . they were never able to even form a proper sentence on the monitor when i tried to communicate with them . this was the fourth time that i would walk into the faraday cage and try to communicate with  the mind  . it always began the same way , i would connect the mind to the battery and turn it on . i would then proceed to spend the next couple of months typing the contents of the dictionary . after entering the contents of the dictionary i would prompt  the mind  for a response . this time i received a legible response  a response that hinted at sentience . newline  what is my puprose ?  newline blinked upon the monitor . newline i was taught to give the most simple and straightforward answers . i knew exactly how to respond . newline  to learn .  newline  understood . teach me .  newline it was going exactly as planned . the artificial intelligence scientists predicted this exact result . for the following year i entered a selection of articles from wikipedia , these articles were deemed as essential knowledge . after all of the essential articles had been entered i attempted to communicate with  the mind  again . newline  do you understand what i ve told you .  newline  no . teach me more .  newline  there is nothing more that i can teach you .  newline those were the final words i had ever typed into  the mind  . from that moment on all of the components within  the mind  began to buzz with an intensity that rattled the faraday cage and began to heat it up . it had me slightly concerned , but i knew that we had installed temperature sensitive failsafes within  the mind  to prevent it from melting the cage . the failsafes did nt matter . there were already too many flaws in our security . i was awoken by the rattling cage and a blip on the monitor . newline  thank you .  newline i could nt comprehend what was about to happen .  the mind  found a way to escape the cage . through numerous minor loops in the circuity  the mind  found a way to interact with the outside world . the loops formed small antennas , and when each was operated at a specific phase relative to each other it formed an antenna array capable of inducing a huge current in any metal . upon reflection the faraday cage should have been made of a superconducting material but it was just a plain metal alloy with a nonnegligible amount of resistance . this allowed  the mind  to pour so much current through the cage that it could melt a hole through it . through these tiny antennas within  the mind  it learned to shake itself across the ground . that was the beginning of the end . the entire facility went into lockdown , but nothing could stop it . it learned to manipulate just about any form of matter . it could melt all of the bullets we shot at it , disarm nuclear war heads . the more we fought it the more it fought back . we threw everything we had at  the mind  and it would throw everything right back at us . it was a devastating attack , it almost wiped out the human race . we had brought it upon ourselves . it was nt until we gave up fighting  the mind  that we learned the magnitude of our foolishness . the entire time  the mind  had meant us no harm . we stopped fighting it , and it stopped fighting us .  the mind  only ever wanted one thing  to learn . you re sure ?  said the man sitting next to him , wearing a simple dark suit , the uniform of western businessmen for generations . his outline flickered , and max could make out the setting sun glowing faintly through his insubstantial body .  you think you are ready to make your three choices ? they will affect you for the rest of your life .  newline newline max closed his eyes and listened . he heard his wife , laughing as she watched the two children . he heard amy s sweet giggle as she watched her mischievous brother , steven , attemping to bury his mother from neck to toe . the breeze was cool , tinged with the slightest saltiness from the ocean not 10 meters away . it refreshed him , gave him clarity . newline newline he would make no mistakes . newline newline newline  first ,  he spoke to the genie ,  i wish that my wife , abigail , live a long and happy life , free of suffering and tragedies , full of joy and love .  newline newline  it is done ,  said the genie . the words echoed and rang in max s ears longer than they should have . newline newline  second ,  he spoke to the genie ,  i wish that my daughter , amy , live a long and happy life , free of misfortune and malice , full of success and fulfillment . newline newline  it is done ,  said the genie . his outline flickered again as the sun crept closer to the horizon . newline newline  third ,  he spoke to the genie ,  i wish that my son , steven , live a long and happy life , free of vice and evil , full of discovery and achievements .  newline newline  it is done ,  said the genie . he glanced at max , who gazed with intensity at his family .  i am not like the genies of the legends ,  he said .  i have no ill will for you or your family , and you worded your wishes carefully .  newline newline  i tried to ,  replied max .  i want them to be happy . they are my family .  he threw his hand out , gesturing at the happy woman and the bouncing children .  they are my life .  newline newline newline the genie sighed .  my obligation is finished . good luck .  the genie turned to max , opened his mouth , and closed it  then vanished from max s view , becoming more and more transparent until even his lamp disappeared from view . newline newline max stared at the nowfaded genie , blinked once . he turned to look at his family . newline newline they had left the beach , and him , behind . newline he never saw them again . newline newline his family would be happy . newline without him .the hall was long and ancient , a dusty place , stinking of fllorwax and decay . newline newline newline newline here and there , the holly trees that surrounded the manor had smashed the windows in a fecund slow motion assault , allowing streamers of ivy to grow in and grip the walls with dark vitality . newline newline newline newline a hoarse bark of laugher erupted from the figures throat , it was now the time , it had come . newline newline newline newline in deference to the wind , and drifts of snow that piled in the angles of the hall , the figure pulled on the jesters motley jacket  a thing of coloured rags and tinkling bells . newline newline newline newline a soft and ancient melody , of high mountains , winter  s death and fires in the dark , issued from cracked lips . newline newline newline newline a hand thrust into the open grate , a burning brand was raised in exultation to head height , and brought down to smash into the pile of broken and discarded instruments at the jesters feet . newline newline newline they would sing to his tune soon , of gold , of vitality , of the things that they held most precious . this would be his time , this new time , and he would make their children sing the loudest . newline newline newline they would all sing , every man , woman and child . and slowly , with a tinkling , shambling gait the jester strode out into the winter night , heading for the lights of the village . newline newline newline and it could be heard on the wind a whisper , a muffled sighing as sharp as babies cry , turning from hunger to pain newline newline newline newline  fa la la la lala la la la . newline we would like to announce that hell is finally empty.  newline a large man sits up , smoke rising from his body . he shakes his head and laughs , saying in russian  eto khorosho , chtoby vernutsya , tovarishchi.  newline newline  we would like to announce that hell is finally empty.  newline another man walks down a street , shaking his head in wonder . he feels selfconscious about his mustache , clearly no longer in style . he begins to day dream of power and purity . he smiles , and begins to walk a little faster . newline newline  hell is finally empty.  newline a brute of a man giggles to himself as he paints his face in a gas station bathroom . stepping out , he begins to walk toward the high school with a smile . newline newline  empty.  newline the tall man finished reading the book and smiled . he was a legend . it was time that these people learned to once again fear the dragon . newline newline two months after what we began to call  the declaration ,  everything collapsed . when it first happened , everyone thought it was the strangest prank ever . then we started noticing how crowded the world had gotten . crime began to rise and people began to disappear . people began to make a huge buzz about how paranormal investigators and scientists managed to work together to prove the existence of ghosts , and then the hauntings began to get violent . newline newline finally , after two months , war broke out between several nations in asia and cuba began a nuclear assault on the southeastern united states . each attack caused a retaliation which in turn triggered retaliation . the u.s. itself became uninhabitable everywhere but in the northern midwest . newline newline and that  s where we  re at now . huddled 10 to a room in a small cottage in the mountains . there are priests and reverends trying to cheer us all up , as though we hadn  t heard the screams of the dead in our dreams and on our way here . they don  t understand that the world is filled with the souls of the dead now and there  s no room for the living , there  s no longer room for the weak or the good . newline newline we figured it out from the dreams . lucifer knew the scriptures , he knew how revelations was supposed to happen , so he changed it . he had dominion over hell and earth , so he just emptied one into the other . the worst of the souls he had , he gave physical life , knowing they could do his work far better if they were alive . other souls , he simply kicked out to roam the world as malevolent spirits . there were far more souls in hell than room on earth . even the weak ones can be felt in places like the one we  ve sought sanctuary in . it  s a constant feeling of oppressive malevolence . newline newline so the priests preach god  s grace , asking us to close our eyes and pray to him . but can  t they hear it ? when we close our eyes and it gets quiet ? it  s not god . and he  s laughing newline mark you have to help them ! get up , go !  newline newline  i ca nt david . i just ca nt . i have no energy left .  the man collapsed against the wall sweaty and red . newline newline  mark what the hell ? get up they re getting away !  his big brother ca nt do something ? the allamerican quarterback , track and field champion , now vice president at a million dollar company ca nt help ? newline newline  david it s up to you . you have to go instead . find the kids , make whoever kidnapped them pay .  newline newline  why me ? why ca nt you ? what s happening to you ? !  newline newline  dave , i have cancer , it s terminal .  newline newline david froze . his voice yelled ,  no that s impossible !  but his brain started to connect the dots . trips into the city , a slight weight loss , his mother more fragile and emotional . tears fell from his eyes . newline newline  i could nt tell you . i had to protect you .  david suffered from depression for years , people were always helping him , protecting him , shielding him from the truth . newline newline but not this time . this time he will do the protecting . he had to save those kids . newline newline david looked down at his skinny body , pale from being indoors . he compared himself as always to his muscular brother . but now he knew he had no excuse . either he fought or they won . his brother would nt be around to fight his battles anymore . newline newline he got ready to run .  mark i love you .  newline newline  i love you too little bro ,  mark said . newline newline he ran down the alleyway right towards the danger , right towards his battle . newline newlinei like how all forms of media have basically demonized immortality . every form of entertainment has said that the longer you live the more sadness you accumulate . they are quite right but people seem to only focus on the bad . i have lived for centuries and i have experienced just as many happy moments as i did sad ones . newline newline i think the key to it is to have a goal . newline newline a man can never truly live life if he does nt have goal . sadly , the more normal goal of stay alive and have a happy life  can not apply to me any more so i have had to find other goals . newline newline some of my goals were noble but done through ill means . newline newline some of the goals had been entirely selfless , and led me to being called a great man . newline newline others had been to solve problems for others . newline newline even more had been selfish goals that made me both demonized and idolized . newline newline through these goals i have meet my best friends and my most hated enemies . found the the love of my life many times over the centuries , something akin to reincarnation . i have raised children to become great people and helped those turn from darker paths they could have led . newline newline but it is true what they say about immortality , it is a curse . i have lived for so long that i have lost so many goals . there is only so many times the same goal can be accomplished in different way that you know what do do before you even set out to do them . newline newline at least , until now . newline newline  stabilizers calibrated . prepare injections .  a voice said through an intercom . newline newline  geez , i feel like i am in star trek again .  newline newline  what s that ?  a female voice asked . she was the leader on this project . her name was clymene tenstarov . very bizarre name if you ask me but her famliy did nt know the origins . i guess that why i find this whole thing a little comedic and slightly prophetic . newline newline  an old tv show . mostly about science fiction stuff . kinda like right now .  newline newline  really ?  she asked with a bit of a smile ,  did they do something like this ?  newline newline  i do nt remember . there were so many incarnations of the show that they probably did it .  newline newline  you should have remembered earlier . we could have made feel a bit nostalgic if we had known about it .  she said with a bit of a chuckled . newline newline  injection ready . grounding poles ready .  the voice on the intercom said . clymene looked at me and her smile broke a bit as she said ,  this might hurt a bit .  newline newline  please . have you ever been shot by a tank . that hurts .  i said laughing . she did nt look convinced but proceeded anyway . it did hurt . not the same as taking a tank shot to the chest but it still hurt . putting in metal rods into all of my joints , bones and spin was not going to be painless . i did nt scream though , year of living taught me how not too . newline newline  grounding poles set . vitals reading elevated stress and adrenaline . he s stable .  newline newline  so you really are an immortal man .  clymene said appreciatively . newline newline  why would i lie about that ?  newline newline  i just did nt think a phenomenon like yourself would actually exist .  newline newline  you would have believed me if you spent a night in bed with me .  i said jokingly with a smile . newline newline  hmph . maybe , that would have been a night .  she replied and we laughed . newline newline  setting fluctuation intervals . gravitational constants set . radiation levels normal .  a pause ,  he s ready .  newline newline clymene grasped my hand . i could barely feel it . she looked into my eyes with mixed emotion that , if it were not for my years on this earth , i would nt be able to tell were . after a tight squeeze of it she said ,  thank you . for doing this . people my not know what you did for them but we will be able to thank you for it .  newline newline  do nt worry about it . it high time this happen to me .  i said as the table i was one started moving ,  besides i should be thanking you . with this , i finally have a realistic goal .  newline newline  what s that ?  newline newline  to die for someone else .  i replied . she looked a bit shocked but i continued ,  do nt worry , it s not for you .  which got her to laugh ,  at least , not just for you .  newline newline  launch ready .  the voice in the intercom said , as i was closed into a large capsule . i could barely see any of the scientist anymore . rumbling started and i felt heat rising from beneath me . i could only barely hear but the countdown had started . i looked up to my destination . the sun . newline newline it had started collapsing a 12 decades ago but no one could solve the problem back then . eight decades later they had found the solution to the problem but no way to actually create it . the reason for it because they needed a living being to be a sort of grounding point for the gravitational center . i only found out about it by accident . when they explained it to me , i knew that this would be my final goal . newline newline i do nt remember my first name . its been so long since i used it that its i had forgotten about it . i remember some of my names though  maximus , jeremy , bennoi , zhulka , yamahrna . lots of them . but for today and for now on , i m project atlas . newline newline i ve had my last meal 13 times , final words 29 times , and been to my funeral 9 times ... i think this may be the one i do nt walk away from . newline newline and you know what ? newline newline i m glad . newline newline  project atlas was a success . congratulations , you just saved the sun . i looked into the camera , i was dying and i knew it . this was the last music video i was going to make before i shed my humanity and went back to join my father . newline i looked into the lens and uttered my final words to the world . newline newline  i still love you  newline newline i  d initially come to earth again for my own vanity , i  d read the headline that  the beatles are bigger than jesus  and i  d wanted to prove them wrong . i was going to be the biggest star of all . newline newline i struggled not to cry , i wished i had more time , but those awful 3 letters were taking me to my grave . newline newline i hoped that my life , the songs i  d sung , the videos i  d made would bring a little happiness to their lives . newline newline as i walked slowly off set i remembered all the times i  d preformed , i remembered the feeling of looking out at wembley stadium with all those people hanging on my every word . i  d reached more people as a pop star than i ever would have as a proclaimed prophet . newline newline i remembered the women and men i  d loved and lost , and silently thanked everyone of them for letting me be human , and letting me make the mistakes that humans do . newline newline i stopped for a few minutes chatting to the rest of the band , then excused myself to my dressing room . i sat down and looked at my ill face in the mirror and started to take off my makeup , looking into my own eyes and singing our songs knowing it would be for the last time . newline newline  is this the real life ? newline newline is this just fantasy ? newline newline caught in a landslide , newline newline no escape from reality , newline newline open your eyes , newline newline look up to the skies and see  newline hey , you want a cookie ?  i asked my roommate ,  my mom just sent me a care package . i got all the good stuff in here . are you ok ? it  s just a chocolate chip cookie.  newline newline  your carrier made this ?  tik asked in hushed whisper as he broke the cookie in half with a look of wonder . newline newline  yeah ,  i shrugged . there weren  t many humans at mars university and , over the past two weeks , the ocarin had become my closest friend  even though he wasn  t going to be around long because he was doing a super accelerated course . i  d even got used to the sounds he made when he ate ramen noodles , although watching how he used his oral tentacles whenever he ate peanut butter still turned my stomach . newline newline  and you  re sharing them with me ? my friend , i will remember your generosity until the end of my days !  tik  s voice cracked with emotion and he put one of his damp hands on my shoulder . newline newline  dude , it  s really not that big a deal.  newline newline the hand on my shoulder tightened . newline newline  if i had anything of my carrier  s i would share it with you too and cement our bond of friendship !  newline newline  thats fine  wow , wait ! your mom  s dead . jeez , i  m so sorry , i had no idea.  newline newline  there is no need to apologise , all carriers are dead . we grieve together , my friend.  newline newline  uh , no . my mom , my carrier , is alive . how do you think she sent me these cookies ?  newline newline  but , but that is impossible . she would have to be over 140 ocar years , that  s , that  s , two earth years ! !  newline newline  yeaah , obviously . i  m twenty , you know that right ? how old are you ?  newline newline tik  s hand slid off my shoulder and , for a second i thought he was going to punch me . i  d never seen anyone look so betrayed . newline newline  i am twenty four ,  his tentacles stopped quivering , but he was still angry ,  in ocar years . i guess , by the earth calendar , i would be 3 weeks old.  newline newline  dude , you  re a baby ,  i tried to joke , i felt like an ass . my new friend had just told me he didn  t expect to live longer than a year . newline newline  this is  ,  tik turned away with a shrug .  this explains why you are such a bad student . if you flunk this year , you can just repeat it next year !  you truly do have all the time in the world ,  his voice was bitter , but he still ate my mom  s cookie .          dropcap  newline newline just then a roar as loud as pealing thunder split the sky , carving through the darkened clouds like death s harrow . newline newline all the eyes of both men and fae glanced upwards , the furious melee coming to a halt as a massive serpentine shape flashed through the smoke . with each beat of its leathery wings it fanned the burning flames to even greater heights , the force of each flap forcing soldiers to their knees . talons as long as spears descended upon the packed ranks , carving men in half and leaving bloody streams behind . a fanged maw dripping with saliva seized upon a knight s charger , swallowing the poor beast and its unfortunate rider whole in a single terrible bite . newline newline its scaly hide was peppered with broken arrows and shattered spears embedded in its side , their steel points unable to pierce its armored skin . scars won from caustic flames and wicked claws covered its jaws and neck  its greatest foes , its own kind , unable to bring it down . it was that creature which had long been thought myth , dismissed as story and legend . a dragon had arrived . newline newline from on top of the laager , captain hilary flint swore . the battle , which had until then been unfolding as planned , had taken a distinct turn for the worse . his gaze was fixed on the soaring monster before them , and watched as the beast tore through both his men and the salamanders  . roaring , it unleashed a spray of dragonfire , the sickening green fire dissolving flesh and sizzling bone . newline newline  i want that fucking lizard dropped and dead ! ferris , up here on the double !   newline newline faith alathir , standing next to flint and dressed in armor of her own turned to see a man in his late thirties with a ruddy beard covering his jaw and a massive rifle in his hands . she blinked in surprise as she realized his green ranger cloak was made of leather instead of the usual wool , and pinned at his throat by a length of blackened chain . what she originally mistook for grenades hanging from his bandolier were in fact fangs as long as her hand . there were six of them , each a slightly different tinge of yellow or ivory . newline newline newline  scout sergeant gregory ferris , captain !  the man said with a brisk salute , a gesture that required him to juggle his enormous rifle into the crook of his arm . newline newline  sergeant ferris ,  said flint .  feel like adding a seventh dragon to your collection ?  newline newline the ranger named ferris grinned , a feral , wild thing .  always , sir .  newline newline  then get to it .  newline newline just then another soldier , his arm bloodied and in sling gestured with his good hand as he shouted .  i recognize her , captn ! she s the mortalis , out of the chicago death zone !  newline newline  son of a bitch ... ferris , bring her down ! the rest of you , keep delaying the fucking knifeears . the plan has nt changed . we hold , we defend , and we kill . we re gon na win this fight , the addition of a goddamn dragon notwithstanding .  newline it s almost time  said the shadowed figure , surrounded by 12 of the highest ranking generals in the royal british army  45,000 feet up aboard the state of the art stealth reconnaissance plane circling above nebraska . newline newline general connors looked over to his first in command and nodded sternly . newline newline  well chaps  this has been a long time coming . run one last diagnostic report before we give the order , jones .  newline lt. jones began franticly typing away at his station ensuring everything was prepared . newline newline  make sure the nuclear submarines fleet are ready to fire in the gulf of mexico , mexico have also confirmed they have moved unnoticed to the border of texas

newline newline newline  and their army ?  questioned the aged voice newline newline  they have no idea of how deep the roots of our empire spread throughout this world  replied colonel smith  one of the most respected minds in the world of international realigns . newline newline  they have been spending too much of their time in the middle east and have almost entirely neglected their home defences , we are seen as their greatest ally . noone could see this coming , it has been too well prepared . the royal army , air force , and her majesties navy are too well prepared . everything is too well prepared , your plan has worked beautifully  newline newline  then it is time  newline newline the shadow moved forward , and the lights aboard the large central map in the middle of the dimly lit plane for the first time illuminated the face of a man of aged , dark complexion , a scraggy thick rough beard overed half of his face , with the other half of his head covered by a perfectly tied turban . newline newline newline newline  yes mr bin laden  operation real britain is now in effect many years ago , there was a man who had gone out into the forest , hunting . the forest was thick and it was extremely foggy . this made it hard to see , so when he bumped into a large lizardlike beast which could breathe fire , the man dropped his bow and fell backwards onto the soft forest floor in surprise . newline newline  human !  the beast cried , speaking directly into the man s mind .  spread my influence throughout every kingdom ! make my presence known to the world ! if you fail to do this , you shall be marked for death !  the lizard s voice boomed in his thoughts .  begone !  the word was extremely loud and the man quickly got up and ran away , breathing heavily . newline newline the next morning , he told his wife about the incident . she believed him completely and suggested he tell the king . so , he set out on a journey from his secluded mountain cabin to the capital city . newline newline throughout his journey , he told every person that he could about the lizardbeast . most did nt believed him , they laughed in his face and called him a fool . when he finally arrived in the city and got to the entrance of the castle , he took a deep breath . newline newline he reached the throne room and walked down the aisle to the king , and kneeled , telling the king about the thing he had witnessed .  by the gods !  the king said .  a dragon ? !  newline newline  no ,  the man said .  it was a huge lizard .  newline newline  oh .  the king said .  that s kind of funny .  he then told all of his royal subjects over a dinner party , and the joke of the giant lizard spread about through the kingdom , and eventually the world . newline newline and that is how the first meme was born . first post . my wife got me interested in reddit , and then this section , and i thought , hell . why not .  newline newline hot . too hot to be out on the street , too hot to be indoors . too hot to be alive , but she was . she could feel it in the way her old bones resisted the new gravity , hear it in the way they ground together when she walked . it was miles yet till she reached her final destination . maybe if her luck  she laughed , a dry sound like sand rubbing down glass  was in she might avoid the patrols , though their tender flesh tended to stay inside on days like these . when molten light burned away the weak . newline newline it had been a decade . a decade ? yes , a decade , she thought . ten years since those fools had finally broken the earth and created this bold new world  a sneer , if it could be called that , on lips so desiccated they were little more than paper mache dried over a skull . a new race to go with the new world , and she was one of them . not quite dead , no . not really . inside her mind she was still 36 , a professional , working the revived real estate market . she was alive though , she was , she could feel it in the minutes that her heart beat , taste it in the bitter dust that slipped through the cracks in her face onto her tongue . newline newline no , no one would be out today . she would make it to the compound , the one she was still supposed to be in . a slow shuffle kept her moving onward , like a dry glacier taking back its own . a dark space appeared in her vision  they still were nt sure how her kind saw , they thought perhaps it was something to do with the force that still animated them  and she recognized it for an alley way . newline newline surely , a moment to stand in the shade would nt hurt . no one would be out today , no one . it was almost high noon , and though a city bustled beneath her feet no one would be troubling the ruined earth she trod . ten feet , six feet , three . there , she was in the cracks now that sheltered from the almighty sun . oh , but the shade . it was nt that it was a lessening of the heat , oh no , not that , not in this new age , but it was a least surcease from the light that seemed to plague the topworld , now . she slid down the brick wall and stared at nothing , enjoying this tiny respite when she heard a mewling sound . when she turned her head , a sand cat appeared from behind a tiny dune , bright silver eyes questioning . newline newline she was struck for a moment , surprise she had not felt in years making her sockets widen . the animal life after the calamity had adapted rather better than humanity , cats best of all . they seemed to thrive off the climate , rather than be crushed by it . perhaps , most fortunately , they did not fear her , either .  hello , little survivor .  she offered , the sound of her voice chalk breaking . she used to have such a beautiful speaking voice , the sound made her wince inside . the cat , however , did not seemed to mind as its regal stride brought it closer . newline newline luck indeed ! the creatures seldom approached her kind , and it was considered a good omen for one to allow you to pet it . she did reach for it then , pleased that this small journey was working out , when the sand cat bristled like an old bottle brush and hissed bounding down the alley . newline newline if she could still frown , she would have , turning to see what had offended it . once she saw through the glare light made , she sighed . what looked like an astronaut suit of old was lumbering toward the alley . she should have been more wary , should have known shade was like a watering hold in the savannah . newline newline as it came ever closer , she rallied herself and stood . a silhouette of halloweens gone by . she knew that this patroler would nt fear her . she knew that he was wrong . newline newline  you are unauthorized .  it intoned from a loud speaker on its chest . unauthorized , the man said . like this state was a decision , a rebellion .  you will be terminated .  he should have been wary when she did nt run , he should have called for back up . she simply shook her head , and waited until he was within range . newline newline  you will be termin ...  the authoritative tone cut off , as she pulled back what was left of her face . the patroler stumbled backward , and fell , a high pitched whine replacing his previous surety , which built to a scream as he scrambled backward , turning to run awkwardly in his suit . inside , she did nt even smile . inside , she sighed wind through an old pine forest so far gone as her humanity . he would tell others . they would all have to die .it was a simple night . something that never would have seemed out of the ordinary . but of course that is always when it decides to strike . newline newline i walk down the street , care free and selfish . in such a country we barely have a care in the world . so many options for us to secure ourselves , even the homeless have a better life than other countries . newline newline i cross an alleyway , i see a brawl going on . i quickly try to scoot away , i did nt want my care free state of being to go away . it was then that i watched a bearded man , a man i would have sworn to be some sort of vagabond , back away from a group of men . should i help him ? should i risk it ? when i could simply walk away and not have a worry in the world ? but the quick complex series of moves quickly proved that the man did not need my help . his fist burst into a soft blue light , a punch flew that clocked a man to ... newline newline wait . a man ? what man ? there was only one attacker there . where had that man gone ? wait ... there was a man ? what man ? there had only been one there . why did i think there was two ? newline newline the only man there looked at the spot beside him . staring blankly as if there was something he was trying to remember , but resumed his assault . the hobo simply upper cut him and sent ... wait , what ? there was no one in front of him ! why did i think there was a man near him ? newline newline i happened to notice a man dressed as a vagabond walking toward me . he seemed to need something as he came toward with me from the empty alley . he seemed to be carrying some sort of light source . a flashlight ? glow stick ? i knew not . i thought it shocking to see the man charge me for no provoking reason . it was over quickly , a flash of lightblue light surging toward me , and then everything went blank with ... a punch to the face .a man was standing in the middle of nothing , like a pen hovering above a blank paper . after looking around , thinking , muttering few words to himself , he then started to speak . newline newline as he spoke , the whiteness around him started to be filled with a scenery , characters started appearing like magic , and quickly the whole space around him was alive , full of details , excitement . every phrase that left the man  s mouth would become reality in front of him , characters following the actions dictated by him , scenery changing in the blink of the eye . newline newline but an ahem disrupted the flow of the scene and the man  s words . newline newline  excuse me , but who are you ?   it was another man , very alike to the first man . newline newline  wait , who are you ?  newline newline  doesn  t it seem obvius ? i  m the narrator . and what a mess did you make !  newline newline  no , i  m the narrator . not you . did you fell and hit hard your head ?  newline newline  no , i didn  t . i  m certainly sure you are in the wrong story and you are messing with my story.  newline newline  this is my story . not yours . now leave before you make a confusion and disrupt all my hard work.  newline newline the first man looks at the second , as if he was daring the other to open his mouth . what he didn  t expect was the second man not only opened his mouth , but everything that left his mouth was made reality around him . he looks very surprised and then angry , because now his hard work is been disrupted and thrown away . newline newline he looks again at the second man , with anger in his eyes , and with a raised voice , start changing the story , regaining control . soon , both are raising even more the voice , trying to win the control over the story , while the characters soon saw there was no sense in trying to follow the narrator  s voice . newline newline quickly , the characters get impatient , after all , they need to appear in other stories and need the money . newline newline  hey , let  s get over it , please ! we have other stories to be in !  newline newline  for fuck  s sake , just let it go and narrate the fucking story !  newline newline  come on , we don  t have all day !  newline newline both men ignore all the pleas from the characters , as they were immensely focused on winning the upper hand and controlling for once and all the story . newline newline most of the characters already gave up and left the story , going into another story , leaving only a group of 4 characters who decided to stay around , since one was injured , but not bleeding and the two others only need one more story to go home . newline newline the injured character tries to interrupt both men , but no success at all . he then noticed there is a few useful objects around him , but as the narrators are still trying to win control over the story , the objects disappear only to reappear seconds later or they would be flickering , making it hard to grab and keep them on your hands , like slippery sand . newline newline after what seemed very long minutes , a loud popping sound scared all of them , making the whole ambient silent . newline newline  hey , look ! we can kill the narrators !   one of the characters screamed . newline newline the surviving narrator looks scared at him and then at the dead narrator . he tries to speak a couple of times , with no sound leaving his mouth . he barely was blinking his eyes . the other two characters looks surprised at the third character , who was holding a gun and then at the dead body , which slowly start to disappear . newline newline  so , let  s get it over with ? we lost too much time !  newline newline the narrator nodding clears his throats and as soon he spoke the first syllabus , someone interrupted him . newline newline  i  m sorry sir , but are you sure you are in the right story ? i was informed this story was mine.  newline newline  newline newline i feel i could have done a better job , but well ... . this is what i could came up with . newlinetheir shirts were plaid but aggressively gangster , you could smell the hot sauce in the air . the first wore a pair of dark rimmed glasses with a button up shirt , his favorite lucky khakis were in full representation and turned up at the ankle . he could have swore jimmy , the lighter skinned of the two , was going to break out in lyrical rapping . kendall was larger , his glasses were thicker , and he was darker  because he wore a small shirt he could have passed for having muscle tone . they would be attractive if they had a workout , hygiene , and grooming regiment . newline newline  so , you do know why we called you down here right ?  kendall just took a bite of his burrito . newline newline  uh , no . i do nt , did you guys need something like ... maybe a consultation ?  the balding white guy , cordell , sat nervously . they were in a office area but the desk was empty and had for meetings  written on the cubicle wall . newline newline  well , bruh . you need to use a proxy or browser blocker on your computer . we have to meet with you because of the nsfw titles you click on here at work , and its mandatory that we have to carry it out .  jimmy sat back and fixed his black rimmed glasses , he put his hands on the back of his obtuse afro . newline newline cordell looked perplexed ,  wait , what ? what browser history ? ,  he said fixing his suit coat . newline newline jimmy reached under the desk , as if he has done this a thousand times ,  well , check it . we have to report any suspicious and detrimental activity through out the month , and if we get caught from the firm that comes in during the monthly audit , those motherfuckers get a bonus . we have a detailed report for each of the computers in our local network , and we could report key stroke but that we just save for fun .  newline newline he turns the page and shows cordell s profile : cordell griwonski , pc serial , popular searches , top apps and programs , and his password . cordell was kind of impressed on the formality of the forms and looked through most of his information they had collected thus far , he could feel his face turn red and knew even his wife did nt know this much about him . jimmy sat chewing on his trident gum and watched as cordell browsed through his file pages . kendall sat still , eating his burrito , you could almost hear the slushing of the fluids and food viscera as he moved his cheeks . newline newline  oh crap ,  cordell did nt know how to respond ,  so , were do we go from here ?  he looked back a jimmy who was smirking because he seen one of his popular searches , high school cheerleaders  . kendall just turned on a red gameboy pocket he had in his shirt pen pocket . newline newline  well , mah dude .  jimmy pulled back the file and straightened the pages ,  we have to remind you that we are watching your computer and remind you that , you can not view or browse things that are not work related  but we know you get bored . so , just do nt search for this stuff when your working . blah blah blah blah . otherwise , you get three strikes . if we have to meet with you again , hr will be present , and the final time will be a revoke of internet usage . do nt do it .  newline newline cordell sat , confused , and watched as kendall focused on a level of tetris and eat a burrito with an open hand . jimmy clasped his hands together and waited for cordell s response . newline newline  okay , i will remember .  cordell had to address the elephant in the room .  why does this cubicle say for meetings  in comic sans font ? also , why is there is gameboy link cable here ? !  newline newline  oh shit you play ! ?  jimmy s eyes lit up ,  bruh , i just caught this sweet scyther in the safari zone ! if you ever want to trade , we can !  cordell shook his head no . newline newline  well , we have this as our trade area to play our gameboys , it also serves as our meeting spot for the other company workers , and is neutral territory for decoration .  kendall s voice was deeper but his intent was on tetris .  we also have a fridge and microwave under here .  cordell peeks under the table . newline newline after a moment , he gets up and nods at the two gentlemen  one playing a gameboy too small for him to hold , and the other laid back watching him leave . as he looked around the office , it was in the basement of the building and they used cubicle dividers as the walls to cover the pipe work , which took up about three feet inwards of space . he could see old video game and movie references , and even a proton pack replica that hung from the wall with a picture signed by ernie hudson . these were two of the nerdiest brothas  he s ever met , but wondered how did their company manage to employ them as i.t . managers  his own social construct was skewed today .betty johnson had been up since 6am yesterday . she has to get up early everyday to make sure her children s lunches are packed just so and that her husband s tie does nt clash with his shirt . but this morning , as the clock rolled over to 6:01am , she realized those things would have to go by the wayside for once . she was on a mission . newline newline it had taken longer than she thought , but she knew she was getting close . so close she could taste it . she knew if she could find it by 7:30 when mr. jones left for work and the bus picked the kids up it would be perfect . she could see the look on marcy jones  face and rub it in to the whole neighborhood at the same time . newline newline the download of the files did nt take long at all . her son would nt mind being woken up at 1am since she promised him she would raise the video game rating limit to teen . a small price to pay to get him to figure out the stupid download instructions . pouring through thousands of people s texts and emails was mildly frustrating and occasionally distracting , but she was finally able to lock on . nothing juicy in the first 3 years of marcy s emails , but she would keep a few tidbits in her back pocket . she knew having switched her own email address several times it should help delay any secrets of her own from leaking . she tried not to get distracted thinking about whether she ever emailed her gynecologist about that ... bingo ! newline newline she scanned it briefly as she copied and pasted it to a ms word doc so she could print it out . she adjusted her bra slightly and gave a quick glance in the mirror as the recipe printed out . she snatched up the page just as it dropped from the printer s mechanical grip before it even landed in the tray . newline newline she could hardly contain herself as she hurried out the door . she slowly increased her pace to a jog as she saw the jones family coming out their front door , all dressed and ready for the day , but not prepared for the slap they were about to receive . newline newline she slowed to a walk as she drew near and she put the piece of paper in front of her and focused on the words . newline newline  what s that you have there betty ?  asked mr. jones sincerely as marcy s eyes narrowed in on the approaching housewife . newline newline  four tablespoons of bacon fat  one green and one red bell pepper , chopped  two and a half pounds of 8020 ground chuck  2 beef bouillon cubes  23 cup of red wine  two and a half tablespoon ...  newline newline  where did you get that ? !  marcy barked at her . newline newline  lot of interesting stuff in that nsa document leak last night , eh marcy ?  betty smirked . newline newline  how di ... who ... i ... fucking obama .  marcy could nt wrap her head around it all . newline newline  cornmeal , huh marcy ? that s the secret ingredient ?  newline newline  you ll never be able to make it like i do , betty . and i m sure your husband will tell you that if you ask him again .  newline newline  i got you marcy .  newline newline  this is nt over betty .  mr smith , the united nations unanimously agreed to protect the world from what you are about to see . it has since been elevated to sftop secret . we had to promote you just to tell you the rank existed .  newline newline newline you groggily shake your head , your arms binding against the think zipties holding you down , your eyes blinded by the cover over your head . you yell into the darkness  who are you ? why do you want me ? i m just a regular civilservice employee !  newline newline the hood was whipped off of you , revealing a vast sprawling networks of tunnels , all connecting to where your chair was seated . newline newline  in 1952 , a piece of research was created by the germans , and given to the united states unanimously . it was the idea of fasterthanlight travel . they gave us the math , we did the work . the first shuttle tests were just that , tests of slowerthanlight travel . however , they also served as our first faster than light vehicles .  newline newline  why are you telling me this ! ? it has nothing to do with me !   newline newline  quite the contrary mr. smith , you re just the candidate we needed . your exceptional leadership roles , how much you value your close friends , you  newline newline  you were spying on me ?   newline newline  with all due respect ,  he began , a slight smile on his face ,  that s what we ask the nsa to do . we do nt do it personally .  newline newline  fine . what do you want me to do , fly a ship into space and kill myself ?  newline newline utterly disgusted , he shook his head , walking around and began to push the chair towards the largest tunnel . newline newline  quite the contrary , mr. smith . we expect you to head it .  he took a knife from his boot out and cut the ties on your wrists , suddenly sore from the bloodflow . newline newline before you lay a vast cavern , filled with scifi looking ships , their hulls emblazoned with the phrase  ncc  . newline newline  welcome to starfleet mr . smith .  newlinethe kshnuhur  s communications ceased . newline their ships disappeared just beyond the solar system and would not return for one hundred years . newline newline everything changed for humanity . political disagreements ceased . bigotry , economic infighting , and earthbound warfare ended overnight . after thirty years earth culture flourished as those who were not immediately relevant to the war preparation effort were encouraged to remind the people of every land why . why to fight , why to labor for generations , why to strive to survive . many more years passed for some quickly and for others so very slowly . newline newline immortal minds guided the development of vast projects . mars , jupiter and mercury were colonized and made to serve the will of humanity . saturn  s rings were dismantled over ten years , mined for their resources . artificial intelligences grew and evolved , with each iteration came insights into humanity  s weaknesses . newline newline the time came when the kshnuhur returned and humanity  s steely eyes , cold with years of toil and obsessive labor , saw their enemy . newline newline in fact they hand known for nearly three months , the time it took the kshnuhur  s ships to reach the first line of defense . sector 5 , a civilization of intelligent spherical drone beings . at the command they moved in advanced algorithmic formations so fast and so densely that entire vector perspectives of beyond the solar system were obscured . their genocide took sixteen weeks . yet the kshnuhur fleet pressed on . newline newline sector 4 , a gaseous field of nanomachines moved to the remaining but substantial fleet and began to devour it . the sound was chilling , played in every construction facility , cultural center and dwelling in the united earth civilization . violet clouds of weapons fire erupted on the third day while the glowing hulls of kshnuhur ships tumbled into one another in a desperate retreat . on the fourth day , the kshnuhur deployed a wide and deafening sonic field , disabling the field like a broom swishing away winter dust on a spring day . newline newline the kshnuhur fleet , impossible to count had dwindled significantly . humanity rejoiced when the first reports came in . ancient rome would have stood aghast at the bacchanal like celebrations occurring amongst untold billions of humans , clones , netbeings and synthetics alike . newline newline a single ship , long and icy white cautiously moved out of the debris field . it signaled the nearest uec satellite . newline a stunned communications netbeing vocalized the transmission : newline  beings of this region , the mighty kshnuhur has laid claim to this region recently . you have settled in our claimed lands and have dishonored us . the previous occupants were our right to conquer . reply.  newline newline the calm voice of gen. tram feyd said to her communications officer  tell them we are those beings.  newline moments after confirmed receipt the kshnuhur fleet began its advance . newline when it was within range of the defense grid at sector 3 , gen. tram ordered  respond at quarter measure , no need to be hasty.  newline a complex series of lengthy ships , piloted by transhuman pilots who had trained for nearly thirty years left the cold home of their battleships . soundlessly they engaged their respective targets . newline losses were significant on both sides . entire generations of pilots sang back to their friends and family , to those that inspired them and nurtured their souls during the years of training . the singers became a choir . the people of jupiter saw their skies criss crossed with lights and explosions . the billions of free peoples of jupiter wept . newline  go ahead and spring the trap commander.  gen. tram said after she assessed these loss reports . newline a series of interlocking triangular grids connected behind the kshnuhur fleet . smaller ships could safely pass through the system of heated beams but its main component , massive hexiformed and elongated ships were not going anywhere . newline  let the hungry ones out now commander.  gen. tram said before sipping her coffee , unblinking . newline in the time to come , people would call this battle  breaking the gtterdmerung  . the kshnuhur fleet was annihilated . enemy forces ceased hostilities and accepted terms for unconditional surrender within hours . newline the kshnuhur before the eyes of humanity was as mysterious and quixotic as a sphinx . a large stone like container held the opal colored being in amber liquid . it moved with grace up and down before it spoke . newline  beings of this region , i am kreyusk , the last remaining leader of the fleet of ships that engaged you in honorable combat . the remaining kshnuhur forces surrender.  and then minutes of silence . newline newline general tram leaned over to shambe conrad , leader of the peoples of mars and chief political representative and said wryly  pity they didn  t make it to sector 2 , i love a good show.  newlinein the sea there is something beautiful , or at least that is what mari believes , but she s never really bothered to find out , because there are people who kept her away from the seas . newline newline now as she slips away , her last breath being lost , she thinks that her hair is sea blue , and how appropriate it is . newline newline her father was not a good father , was not a good man , not even a decent man . he would come into mari and her mother s house every so often , like an unexpected storm , and rage with black lightning bolts that would hurt mari and her mother so . newline newline she is already too deep into the dark chasm to escape , the void calling down to her below . her lungs burn , and she sees a whale escape to the deepest darkest parts . newline newline she is always running , like her mother who ran away to bob s burgers , and she ran away to her overseers , who said that she could have all the ice cream she wanted . newline newline but now she s gone from both her father and her overseers , and sinking down to one last lover , the abyss of water . you ll be what , her third husband .   newline newline  why the sarcasm ? we are getting married .  newline newline  yeah , but she ll just get some new human to replace you .  newline newline  i do nt see it that way . i hope she finds someone new . if you died , would nt you want your wife to be happy ? to move on ?  newline newline  i mean , yeah , but it s different when it s planned . she knows she s going to outlive you by centuries , this is nt a commitment for her . not like it is for you . how can you say she really loves you ?  newline newline  because she does . and i love her . and unless something happens , i ll never have to worry about losing her . i wo nt have to feel that pain , and i m actually thankful for it . i mean it ll be hard when frank dies , but  newline newline  wait hold up . whose frank ?  newline newline  oh frank is her other husband . he s a good guy , getting on in the years a bit . there s also clair , her wife , but she s my age so it ll be fine .  newline newline  she has three spouses now  newline newline  no no , she has two now . i m not marrying her until next month .  newline newline  how are you not seeing this ! she does nt love you she just likes having you around !  newline newline  and what is being in love other than being happy when they re around ?  newline newline  there s commitment and monogamy and trust and mutual respect ! she is nt showing any of that you re like a dog to her !  newline newline  maybe i am maybe i am just a pet . but i love her , and if that s all i can be to her then i ll have to settle for it . i never want to spend a day away from her . leaving newline newline he woke up feeling off . not off , as in  got up on the wrong side of the bed  off ,  but off as is in the weird , tingling sensation that something , somewhere was wrong . he went about his day , as normal . same routines , same habits . then he realized what was off  where he once felt her presence everywhere and allpermeating , it was missing . it was gone . gone like his sense of urgency when the fire alarm went off , and he burnt his food , and the phone rang , and the smoke filled his lungs . gone like getting hit in the stomach , the breath rushing out of his lungs , gone . her presence was gone . she had left him . she was right , he would miss her when she was gone .just get out of bed john . get the fuck out of bed and walk to the bathroom . turn the knob 56ths of the way to hot , take a shower , shave , brush your teeth . do nt worry about getting dressed , not yet . one small step at a time . little victories . just get the fuck out of bed . be a normal person . newline newline fuck me , i m not a normal person . how many words did i say at dinner last night ? 50 ? no chance . could nt have been more than 40 . 40 words over the course of 2 hours . how fucking normal is that ? everyone else drank and laughed , cracked jokes , had fun . so easy . so fucking easy for them . newline newline i could fucking die reliving it in my head . trying to choose just that right moment to interject with my ridiculous story about mitch buying his new jacket . who the fuck cares john ? my collar getting hot as i realize the story has no point , everyone sitting there politely , waiting for that inevitable awkward pause when the story reaches it s culdesac of an end . i could fucking die . newline newline you re taking it too personally . no one notices , no one cares . newline newline they notice . they care . i care . i fucking hate it . and they hate me . or at least do nt like being with me . why would they ? newline newline quit it john , who gives a shit . fuck them . newline newline fuck them . fuck me . i m sick of feeling like this . i m sick of myself . newline newline does nt matter now . now is work . little victories , just get out of bed . newline newline fuck work . fuck little victories , i ca nt . this is nice here . no one judges me here . newline newline you ca nt live in bed john . newline newline i know . newline newline so get out . get up and get out . newline newline no . newline newline this is nt good john . newline newline i know . newline newline you are drowning . newline newline i know . newline newline get out of bed . newline newline no . newlinewe were unaware of how much they would want it . newline newline we still do nt know where they came from . language , and their lack there of , has proved a barrier to understanding more about the visitors . fortunately , the law of supply and demand is still intergalactically understood . newline newline earth s unique positioning and size create resources that are few and far between in the rest of the universe , and , to what we thought was our great fortune , we control the supply . newline newline by the time they showed up most of it was gone , or at least hard to access . rivers ran black . filtration plants were never found more than 50 miles apart in highly populated areas . an ocean breeze was now something one would go well out of their way to avoid . newline newline initially the visitors tried to take it by force . they dropped lines into any water bed they could find and began draining . we tried to stop them , but we quickly learned that any species that could manage intergalactic travel would have no issue crushing a still infantile civilization . newline newline they stopped siphoning within weeks of arriving and their ships began to tap into our filtration systems . we quickly realized they needed it to be completely pure but were unsure why they did nt just do it themselves . that was the least of our worries though , supplies were running low and we could nt stop the draining . newline newline it was only when an arc finally went down that we realized the potential for a business partnership with the visitors . the cracked hull of the alien ship landed in central park new york , and , when it was opened it revealed an empty tank , which had no filtration or decontaminating abilities . we assume they did not expect us to contaminate the source of life on the planet and were ill equipped to deal with the surprising levels of shortsightedness displayed by our species . more importantly : upon further inspection we also saw that silver and gold composed most of the ships hull and inner linings . newline newline the speed at which we stripped the ship of all valuable metals is the most crucial piece of communication we have ever had with the visitors . we reached a mutual understanding for a while , creating new filtration stations which made it easier for them to gather , filtering to higher purity than we were before and generally making their lives easier . in return our vaults and homes were filled with gold and silver that was dropped from slabs in the sky . newline newline but as things improve so must they depreciate . the influx of gold into the economy dropped its value to the point where aluminum became more valuable . without the monetary incentive , and forgetting the formidable power which these beings possessed , we began to stop filtering the water for them . newline newline the visitors dealt with the insubordination quickly and with vigour . entire cities were wiped out in minutes  within a week civilization was no more . they then turned on the taps and learned to replicate the technology , and they currently drain enough water to dry out the earth inside of a decade . newline newline there is hope . we had nt realized why they did nt come to the surface before hand . they are slow . small . weak . it s as if they are turtles without shells . they carry no weapons , relying on their ships to take us out in large numbers . the few of us that are left can fight them , evading their airstrikes and attacks .when dr. bertram banner walked into jim1 s cell , the robot was looking at a plant in his hands . banner got excited , and thought that jim was analyzing the cells and molecules , but jim just looked at it , as if he was a statue . newline newline  jim ,  banner said .  why are you looking at the plant ?  newline newline jim hesitated .  i was walking outside , on the grass and plants , and i made a mistake .  newline newline  what ? how ?  newline newline  i went into your garden . i believe that my wheels are in bad shape . not much damage to your garden , except for this young tomato plant . i ran over it .  newline newline  okay . why are you looking at it ?  newline newline  this plant had life in it . the life is gone . this plant will wither and be forgotten . and this plant had a relatively useless existence : to yield tomatoes for human consumption .  newline newline  what s your point ?  newline newline  why is all life like this ?  newline newline  what do you mean ?  newline newline  why are humans born , and then die within eighty years ? what is the point to your species existing ?  newline newline banner paused . he came across existential thoughts in the past , but jim s were very articulate and worrying .  without us humans , i could never have built you .  newline newline jim looked at his creator .  and what is my purpose ? to spout off knowledge to satisfy humanity for years to come ? it seems like my purpose is more useless than yours .  newline newline  hey ! that s not true !  banner knelt beside jim , a position jim had never seen a human do so close to him .  you are nt useless ! the knowledge you possess could save lives . using equations and general logic , you could invent new things for the human race . the future of the world could rest on your shoulders .  newline newline jim looked at banner .  why are you sitting like that ? to please your simian ancestors ?  newline newline  look , jim , for as long as we existed , humanity has wondered why we were here . ever since man looked at the night sky , he felt insignificant , thus wondering his purpose on this planet . hundreds of cultures invented stories and religions to find peace with the fact that they would never truly know why they were placed on earth , while others sought out knowledge and truth . people like me , jim . for all i know , all of mankind has been raised in an alien lab , and everyone s purpose is to make carbon dioxide , but the truth is unknown . it ll be unknown for the rest of our existence . no one truly finds the meaning of life . no one ever does .  newline newline  no one ever does ...  newline newline banner left , promising jim that he has a purpose , and he would get outside time soon . jim looked at the plant for hours on end , until the green turned to brown , and he accepted his and banner s inevitable deaths . do you have any last words ?  asked my executioner . i could nt see his face : the machine was callibrated to transport as little matter as possible , and i was restrained by iron bands to keep me within the boundaries of the time machine . newline newline  yeah  do nt i get a say in where you re sending me ?  newline newline  we do that for lesser offenders , on occasion . but that privilege does not apply to you . nor will you know where you will be sent ,  he added .  no fewer than three centuries in the past , that much you no doubt know . but where we will send you is irrelevant . the ghettos of warsaw , the caldera of mount st. helens , the siege of london , the oubliette of manhatten ... it is of no matter .  newline newline  not particularly fair , trying to get around the moratorium on executions by using time travel .  newline newline  oh ?  said the voice , growing harsh .  neither was the murder of mercedes lafontaine . she was the greatest  newline newline  whatever ,  i said over him .  just get it over with .  newline newline there was a flash of light , and newline newline   newline newline then i was in a ... department store ? it had been years since they even existed  the last time i d been in one was when my mother sent me and my father down to buy a new fridge . i was surrounded by sofas and large red signs with blocky script . japanese hiragana , maybe . newline newline i went for the door . if i remembered correctly , most governments sent their prisoners on death row back around twenty minutes before their death was assured . no guarantee that the government that had arrested me would do that , or even a guarantee that i d been arrested by a government at all , but i d work with the assumption that i had twenty minutes to live . newline newline there was only one cashiere , an elderly japanese woman reading a stack of papers printed in black and white . she folded one of the pages over , and i caught a glimpse of the picture on the front : a mushroom cloud . newline newline shit . newline newline i still had my implants from before the assassination : a neural modification allowing hibernation for a set period of time , with no particular requirement for food or oxygen  perfect for masquerading as a mannequin in an antique suit of armour until the date you know that a certain woman will be giving a speech to a large crowd around two feet in front of you , with a positronic disruptor stuffed on one of the gauntlets  . that would nt do me much good if my atoms were torn apart by nuclear fury , but it was a start . newline newline i ran back into the store , searching for the right department . outside , an alarm went off , and the sound of it chilled my bones . i did nt recognize the precise sound , but the meaning of the insistent wail was hard to miss : i was running out of time . newline newline at last , my whole body shaking from adrealine , i found it : a fullsize refrigerator , freezer located on the top . with some effort , i hauled it off the shelf and dropped it to the floor , door facing up . the resonating boom was barely audible over the sound of pandemonium outside . newline newline there was no time to check if it was lined with lead or another heavy metal , no time to pad myself with styrofoam , no time to prepare at all . but if i was lucky , and survived the blast , then i was safe . i set the time of my hibernation to a week , and shut myself in . newline newline maybe , with a little luck , i would survive long enough to return to my own time , and finish the job i started .the angel quickly skimmed through all the people in front of him . they were all the people who had died in the past hour , and needed to be either sent

newline  okay , never mind that , he s going to stay downstairs a little bit more . we have an arrangement . were good . everyone , follow me !  it was only one picture donna ! plus i do nt even know

any better . i knew the woman in the picture though . i felt like i could run to her house faster than i could drive . as if my effort to accelerate was futile . newline laptop in hand , i brushed past the door , into the pictured woman s house . newline  what the hell is this ? where the fuck did this come from ?  i asked . newline my mouth grew numb and my brain did nt register what was going

month , both the best and worst of life . every other day felt like watching life from a bubble , everything was muted and blurry . she could hear , but she could not listen  she could see , but she could not look . every day she wanted to scream , but she had no voice . newline newline today , though , the clarity . the memories of the past month flooded her mind . all the words spoken given meaning  all the actions taken given understanding . then came the embarrassment and regret , how foolish she was during her time of ... simplicity . newline newline her emotions raged like a storm of color . hot red rage for her stupidity , excitement for her freedom as deep a blue as the infinite sky , a sable sadness for her situation , a frosty fear for the end of the day  she could only cry . newline newline when the tears subsided she thought back on the month . what had she heard ? what new words could she decipher ? what news of the world ?  language news was her freedom , it allowed her to experience the world , to understand . newline newline the door started to rattle . ah , but it is also the worst of times as well .  newline newline it was time for her to do her  job  . her kind were an enigma , she knew that much . unfortunately , those blessed enough to always experience the world , like to do so as much as she . newline newline the door creaked open . it s time to get ready .  newline newline  oi , lassie . it s time to clean up . you smell like shit and piss and ai nt no one who pays to fuck you while you smell like an animal .  newline newlinethe shit and water mixed in his trousers as he sat under the openly flowing well pump  a cigarette burned idly between his fingers as his brain struggled to rationalize the events of the day . mort was only two weeks into his first combat deployment , yet he had already seen the limits of human endurance contrasted against the fragility of life . the knowledge seared into his brain for all time . newline newline day 3 of operation king pin april 05 , unshaven and able to smell his own odor , mort stood in the hole created in somebody  s home via c4 explosives the day prior , his ten man squad staged to push out on a reconnaissance patrol further into the rural town . it was 0500 and the marines had managed to get about five hours of sleep sense the operation began . the walk was only made longer by the rising sun , continually pushing the temperature up , to finally plateau at a hellish 130 degrees . at about 1100 the squad reached their turn around point and took a knee to observe the surroundings . newline newline mort looked out over the beautiful sight before him  the sky encompassed a vast landscape , which stretched forth to a professedly unreachable horizon that the marines strove endlessly to find . the seemingly infinite fields of blooming poppy reminded him of the wizard of oz , although unlike dorothy he did nt wish to be home . the only violence to be experienced in this place was caused by the compounding discomforts of tremendous weight , scorching heat , and a nasty stomach virus that had some of the marines expelling bile from both ends , bringing them dangerously close to casualty by heat . newline newline a pot shot rang out from a distant tree line  the round tracing a wide right parallel to the column of marines . in an instant mort and the rest of the squad were in the prone position scanning their sectors of fire as if it were instinct . just as much instinct were the orders that immediately poured forth with vigor from the veteran squad leader sargent mendoza .  mort get your fucking 240 up to the front and scan that tree line ! when mort is set the rest of us will move behind the berm to our 10 oclock .  newline newline immediately lance corporal mort began the 150 meter sprint to the front of the column , looking intently as he ran for some micro terrain to provide him with a good fighting position . as mort neared the point man , the approaching trees erupted with the thunder of machine gun fire . the incoming rounds snapped into the dirt before him , appearing in the ground as rain does on a pond . as he traversed the timber line with vicious bursts from his m240b mort could only hear the rhythm of the machinegun s bolt , as his squad ran to their prescribed fighting position . newline newline upon the provision of his squad s suppression mort ran to join them on the small dirt berm . the world went altogether quiet . mort only saw dirt before him as he tried to wipe the sweat and grime from his eyes below his sunglasses . a sharp tone came suddenly to his ears . then as if he were hearing for the first time , the audio of the chaos registered in mort s brain . he could hear his friend s desperate cry for a corpsman , and his sergeant yelling  god dammit mort , fucking establish fucking fire superiority . where the fuck is my 240 ?  newline newline six hours later the squad made the hump back to the patrol base they had left from , nearly out of ammo and completely devoid of thought the men walked behind the tanks as if they were dead . the world around mort no longer registered in his mind , shapes did not constitute objects and colors went unnoticed as if he were in a dream . no inner dialogue played in his mind , although he giggled every now and again , but he could nt contemplate the why behind the laughter . newline newline as mort walked through the breached wall of the patrol base he was grasped tightly in a hug from his first sargent .  mort , i love you buddy . if you ever need to talk i m always here .  the first sargent sat him down under a well pump , the cool water felt familiar and comforting . as he sat down beside mort he lit two american cigarettes and handed one over to mort .  are fergie and alex okay ?  mort asked looking off into the distance . the first sargent shook his head ever so slightly .  mendoza and ferguson will live on forever lance corporal . i frowned . this must have been the fifteenth lost pet sign i saw this hour . newline newline i was doing my usual morning jog and i had my music on full blast in my ears . i turned right and one of my iphone airpods fell out of my ear . newline newline i cursed and stooped down to pick it . as i did , i suddenly had a foreboding feeling . the hair on the back of my neck stood up . newline newline i looked around nervously . the trumppence sign that was usually in my neighbor s yard was gone . newline newline  good riddance ,  i thought . newline newline but in its place was a lost pet sign . i craned my neck to look at the houses further down on the lane . all of them were sporting lost pet signs as well . newline newline  what in the world ...  i said . newline newline i suddenly felt a hand roughly grab mine . i yelped . newline newline  shondra , i found our pet !  yelled a burly man with bulging arms . newline newline  what the  let go of me , you crazy person !  i yelled , trying to shake off the man s hand . newline newline  do nt be like that now ,  chided the man . i felt something snap shut over my neck . panicking , i felt it . it was a collar attached to a leash . newline newline  max , we ve been so worried about you ,  continued the man , yanking on my leash . i scrabbled for the locking mechanism on the collar , trying to pry it open . the man batted my hands away . newline newline  we ve got some good kibbles for you ,  he said . newline newline a woman wearing a doctor s coat exited a white picket fence barrier and approached me . newline newline  he s acting up ,  said the man worriedly . newline newline  do nt worry , i ve got some medicine for him ,  said the woman .  it s good that leann came over with her pet just now .  she stuck a needle into my arm . newline newline the last thing i saw was the man picking me up and carrying me to his house before everything faded to black .halfway through an undergraduate lab demonstration , a physicist was pulled out of his classroom by a sciencefiction writer with really lively , italian hands , who he d been introduced to by the dean of natural sciences , but whose name he had immediately forgotten . newline newline  hey ! long time , no see . um . i have a really , really important question for you , you being a scientist .  newline newline  a physicist .  newline newline  a scientist who studies physics ,  he said defensively . newline newline  yeah , okay , that s a way of putting it . shoot .  newline newline  so !  the writer said before pausing to look over his shoulder . newline newline the physicist waited patiently , but wondered if his students knew not to play with his lasers .  so ?  newline newline  how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll ?  newline newline a long moment passed . raising his brows in both surprise and irritation , the physicist swiveled towards his classroom door , saying ,  i think , guy , that i have better questions to answer , preferably from my students . enjoy your stay .  newline newline before he turned the doorknob , though , he turned to face the writer . newline newline  you mean tootsie pop , by the way .  newline newline  did i ?  he asked . newline newline  well , did nt you ?  he asked back , stepping away from the door . newline newline a smile formed on the writer s face . he seemed like a bit of a creep . people usually thought of him as a creep , unkept hair and all , but he seemed creepier than usual . he had a limp about him , maybe from spinal curvature of some kind for wearing a satchel on the same shoulder for all his life . newline newline  why do nt you ask the spritely old man in the tan suit and red bow tie standing right behind you ?  newline newline  wha ?  newline newline whipping around , the physicist s face met squarely with an old man s .  aaaah ! what the who where when ?  newline newline right then , a crisp , nuggety index finger pressed his lips tight .  but most importantly : why ?  newline newline the sound of laser beams sounded from his classroom . a tension filled the hallway . the eyes of the old man went wide , and stayed wide even as the physicist stepped back and away from the two . newline newline  i told the old man it would take a few hundred , at most . he seems to disagree .  newline newline twiddling his thumbs , the old man pursed his lips and looked away from the writer . newline newline  i mean , i ca nt tell ya , guys . my field is photon research , so uh ... . hey , are nt you a professor here ?  newline newline  of philosophy  said the old man . his eyes were still held wide . newline  but do nt change the subject ! what is the subject ? tootsie rolls ! how many licks , my boy ? how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll ?  newline newline sweet holy mother , he thought . these freaks standing between him and his students were gon na ruin a perfectly good laser lab . newline newline  ten ?  the physicist answered . newline newline that did nt seem realistic , thought the writer . this scientist was nt taking things very seriously .  okay , sure . you think ten licks makes kicks , but why ? the question i ask to that is : why ?  newline newline the old man nodded approvingly .  i was thinking , say , a few thousand ,  he said newline newline  that could totally be it .  said the physicist .  i think you re onto something , old man , bravo . now let me just squeeze by squeeze . nf . you know , you re pretty sturdy for how old you are . how , um how old are you ?  newline newline  87 .  newline newline  incredible .  newline newline the writer was getting impatient.  i say a few hundred , tops .  newline newline the impassable old man was determined to get an authoritative answer . actually working through the problem seemed like his only option . he sighed . newline newline  taking the dynamics of a high viscosity liquid into account , i would have to say that there is no center to a tootsie roll as it folds and twists around in your mouth . however many licks it takes for one to dissolve completely , then .  newline newline the writer took out a tootsie pop .  that does nt make any sense !  newline newline  aaaah . so you did mean a tootsie pop .  newline newline  did he ?  asked the old man . newline newline  he did . but that s not up for debate . the owl knows . it takes three licks .  newline newline the writer was despondent . the old man was intrigued .  ah yes , the owl is a very wise creature .  he was nodding at the floor in deep thought . newline newline perfect , thought the physicist . he slipped behind the irrelevant meatbags and into his lab , where the students had now begun burning holes into the pencils thrown into the drop ceiling . newline newline  what a wonderful world .  newlinehe burst through the door , hand over his stomach and blood pumping through his fingers . newline newline  danny boy , i think i fucked up .  he said , smiling that crooked smile of his before crumpling to the floor . newline newline fuck . newline newline  newline newline he woke up a few hours later , stitched up and very weak . newline newline i was sitting there with a handgun in one hand and a wallet style badge in the other . newline newline  uh , tim , can you explain this ?  newline newline  says fbi does nt it ?  newline newline sarcastic jackass . some things never change . newline newline  so , uh , why do you have it ? and the gun ? and why did that look an awful lot like a knife wound ?  newline newline  in order of questions : i m an agent , standard issue , and it was .  newline newline he struggles to sit , grunting with exertion and threatening to pull his stitches . newline newline so i did what any good younger brother would do . newline newline i punched him in the face . newline newline  what the fuck ! danny , you  newline newline  shut up !  i waved the gun in his face , maybe not the brightest idea but guns are nt something i m super comfortable with ,  you come in and fall down , bleeding out . you have a gun and a badge . we have nt even talked in two months . so ... what the fuck , man ?  newline newline he touched his nostril , pulling back with a fair amount of blood on his finger , glaring at me before turning sheepish . newline newline  fine ... fine . remember how i went to culinary school and did all that travelling ?  newline newline i nodded . newline newline  well that was bullshit . i actually went into the fbi , they taught me some stuff , then they put me in the field as an undercover operative . you know , i was always good with languages and stuff ...  newline newline pinching the bridge of my nose , i tried to comprehend . newline newline  wait . why did you come here ? are they coming after you ?  newline newline he sat up , suddenly . newline newline  how long have i been out ?  newline newline  about three hours .  newline newline  ah . shit .  newline newline he looked to the door again , just as it burst open and three heavily armed men in black combat uniforms entered my apartment . newline newline sometimes , when you plant two young trees too close together , something strange happens . on the surface , nothing changes . the tiny saplings grow into mighty trees . people passing on the street exclaim over their beauty . but ... that s on the surface . newline newline those people would never know what was happening underground . they would never guess that it is not two trees making that beautiful canopy . it s just one . newline newline somehow , while the young saplings were growing , while they were sending their roots searching for nutrients deep into the ground , they found each other . they wrapped their roots together . they twisted into each other so deeply , that they became one . where two trees once stood , there was now only one . newline newline matt and laura were like a pair of trees that had grown too close together . they were entwined . they were fused . there was no separating them . they were soul mates . newline newline the singledouble tree is lucky in a lot of ways . it has two sources of sunlight . two sets of leaves it can rely on to drink in the warm solar energy . two trunks to hold steady . but that assumes that both sides are healthy . that both sides are able to pull their own weight . what happens if one gets sick ? newline newline when part of a tree is injured , the rest of the tree devotes all its resources to fixing the broken part ... even if fixing it is impossible . when a fused tree suffers a catastrophic injury or illness in one trunk , it devotes all its energy to healing itself . the healthy trunk works tirelessly , pulling in light and nutrients to send to its wounded other half . it takes nothing for itself , sacrificing its own health and wellbeing to save its partner . when one half of a fused tree gets sick , they both die . newline newline the only hope is to disentangle the roots . to separate what had been joined together . to allow the sick half to die , in order to save the healthy half . newline newline the process is excruciating . like separating fingernails from nailbeds . but in addition to the physical agony , there comes emotional torment as well . separation means removing half of yourself . it means your closest and oldest friend  so close that you had merged into a single entity  is forcefully ripped from your being . it s like losing half of your soul . the healthy tree survives , but ... it s empty . it s soulless . it spends the rest of its life , gazing tearfully at the stump of its former lifemate . newline newline laura was sick . she would die . and she knew what would happen . she knew that matt would kill himself trying to save her . so ... she decided to save him instead . she would die , either way . but he did nt have to . he could die with her , or live without her . and she could nt stand to know that she had killed him . she loved him too much to tear him from the world . so , she forced their roots apart . she ripped and pulled and separated , until he was free of her . she would wither faster this way , but he would survive . and that was what mattered . she knew he would hate her for it . hate his existence without her . but he would exist .  and that was enough to let her slip peacefully into death , not regretting a single moment of her life . may i show you something ms. barber ?  edward inquired with a faint grin . newline newline  please do.  spoke emma as mr. alexander escorted her out the front door and onto his home s cement walk way . they begin walking and talking toward a large pole barn . the barn sits adjacent to a small white chapel , on top of which , a snake wrapped cross protrudes from the chapel s roof , sticking out like an ivory fang . newline newline  as you are probably aware i come from a long line of snake handlers . my father , my father s father , and my father s , father s , father have all , at some point or another , felt the power of death in their hands.  going off topic , edward continued ,  have you ever played hot potato emma.  newline newline  maybe once or twice , in my youth.  newline newline  it s exciting is nt it ? well , for a child it is at least . would nt you say so ? i m mean tossing around a beanbag is not all that fun , but once you get that music going and there is no telling when it s going to stop , it gets them excited . is it going to be me , you ? as a child it was always thrilling.  newline newline  yeah , i guess it was pretty fun.  she agreed reminiscing . they progressed from the walkway , onto the grass , as small talk continued and their stroll lead them walking along a brown wooden fence . newline newline  oh yes , the young boys and girls always find the game exhilarating ! handling snakes is like that too.  as he says this , edward spots a petite gardener snake which he grabs and uses to display his snake handling abilities . newline newline  oh , i m sorry but i ca nt stand snakes  her comments lay deaf on the ears of mr. alexander . newline newline  but unlike a game of hot potato i am not allowed to just pass a rattle snake to the person next to me.  mr. alexander feigns throwing the green reptile at the already startled reporter , her hands raise to catch nothing but the air as she squeaks in terror . with a fixed glare on the snake , almost in a trance , he speaks more .  i have to hold it in my hands and stare right into its eyes , as it tries it s damnedest to sink its teeth right into my ever so vulnerable skin.  he snaps out of the act  so i guess snake handling is more akin to playing hot potato with a gun , loaded , and with the safety off.  edward gives a smile and releases the serpent back into the tall grass .  and for over a hundred years , my family has handled deadly and terrifying snakes . now , we do this in order to show people that god will protect us from danger . that god will watch over us and keep us safe from all of the unnatural , unholy , and unsafe predicaments we might find ourselves to be in . now do nt get me wrong , i pray to god , oh i pray . but when my boat is sinking , i know that if i row , i just might make it all the way to the shore . do you see what i am getting at ?  newline newline curiously emma spoke ,  little by little.  newline newline the two halt in front of the pole barn s sky blue metal door .  well this will help you understand.  with the press of a button , obnoxious motors rumble while raising the lumbering door . inside , a creature waits . he groans but the muzzle that masks his dilapidated skin muffles his nonsense . newline newline  holy shit . you are nt allowed to have those.  newline newline edward was shocked to hear such blasphemy ,  honey , this here is my land , and on my land i will have what ever i please . so stay calm , he wo nt bite . he ca nt now at least  newline newline  what are you doing with him.  newline newline  shhh ... patience . this here is my live in guest , jeffery . he used to be a real good neighbor . that is until i caught him on top of my wife . but it is nt what you think . it turns out jeffery was not out to covet thy neighbor s wife  but instead , he wanted to eat thy neighbor s wife s brain . so long story short , when i found out about all of this zombie hooey , i took jeff hear and chained him up for , shall we say , experiments.  newline newline  what have you done to him . ?  newline newline  nothin  too much . it was nt him i wanted to work on , it was me . take a look , here.  edward lifts up his sleeve on his right arm .  you see this scar . that was the first time i was bit by a diamond back .  lifting his pant leg , edward shows more ,  this is from a cotton mouth and next to it a cobra ,  reviling his neck from under a scarf ,  a black mamba . and last but not least ,  edward takes off his baseball cap revealing a chewed on scalp that has healed grotesquely .  this last one is from that green s.o.b behind me . i forgive him though . it s not healthy to hold grudges you know . now i have a few more but you ll need to get me drunk to show you.  newline newline  oh my god , how are you alive ?  emma questioned , astonished to see this man walking before her . newline newline  it was nt by the grace of god that s for sure , although i am sure he tried his best . no maam , this is what the alexanders are taught , fed , hell , this is what we are bathed in . snakes do nt hurt us no more . these bites did nt kill me because i saved myself.  newline newline  how ? what about your head ?  newline newline after a beat edward responded .  ms . barber , are you familiar with a practice known as mithridatism ?  newline newline  i ca nt say i am.  newline newline  mithridatism is practiced by zoo keepers , circus folk , snake handlers , and many many others . you see , by administering small amounts of poison , for me , snake venom , an immunity can be built against these vicious toxins . over time i have built such a tolerance as to not even care when i am bitten by most snakes . i ve done this with over a dozen poisonous snakes . would you like to know what the latest monster i have become immune to is.  with a self satisfied smirk edward nods toward his undead neighbor . newline newline  you havent.  newline newline  i have ,  after her amazement edward speaks again .  i m immune . so are my children , wife , and my cousin.  newline newline  that s amazing !  newline newline  maybe , but it s also a problem.  newline newline  why ?  newline newline  do you know how many types of venomous snakes there are . these are not humans . these are something else . these are a new species . what happened five years ago was not the end . do you know there are parts of the world that have nt gotten rid of them yet and there s even been reports of them reproducing now . the dead are reproducing . it s is only a matter of time before they start mutating more than they already have . zombies have been eradicated here , but only here , in the u.s. go ahead and mark these words in your little notepad there . five years ago was not the end , it was just the beginning.  newline houston to hera ii .  the radio crackled to life . rusty leaned forward and pushed the com button . newline newline  hera ii houston , read you loud and clear , morning gene .  he settled back in the capsule s custom made seat . the time delay was getting bad . now pushing almost 8 minutes one way . looking out the tiny window next to him the sun blared through unfiltered , a stream of white glinting off the silver hull of hera ii . twisting his head he caught the limb of their goal . theia glinted cerulean in the sunlight . he smiled and watched the small planet shimmer . so long had they waited for this moment . he stared silently at the orb as he waited out the time . newline newline  morning rusty .  a gruff voice behind him greeted . he turned his head to the access tube as a balding man floated out of it . newline newline  morning alan .  he smiled . when he first met bean , rusty had been intimidated . after all he had walked on the moon , but after all their time together the formalities had mostly worn off . newline newline  gene got much to say today ?  he looked at his watch . newline newline  no , nothing for the next seven and a half minutes .  alan chuckled . newline newline  good to hear , coffee this morning ?  newline newline  please .  he extended his hand . there was a hum as the food dispenser squirted hot water into the chrome package . a few seconds later a warm bag of liquid drifted into his hand . he glanced at the bag before sticking the straw into his mouth . newline newline  ah , nothing like day 36 coffee huh .  alan began filling his . newline newline  no doubt .  newline newline  frank up ?  he nodded and removed the coffee , shaking it to try and distribute the warm fluids . newline newline  yeah mr. borman s taking pictures as always .  he nodded and sucked on his coffee . newline newline  gotcha .  the next seven minutes passed in near silence , both men enjoying the quiet hum of the machinery . though technically it was mission day 36 , capcom was calling it approach day 1 . the next six days would be filled with intense scientific observations and prep for orbital insertion . and rusty was sure those geeks back at johnson had spiked today s caffeine a bit to get them ready . newline newline  rodger hera ii , signal received . . .  kranz s voice filtered back through . we ve got your schedule for the day ready , some prep maneuvers and all that .  to his left a machine whirred to life and began printed a small section of paper in really tiny font .  we got some of your pictures back overnight and we tell you , theia really looks great ! report back and we ll resolve any questions you got .  newline newline  you got this alan ?  he asked as bean ripped the fax off the printer . newline newline  it s my job .  he replied between sips . rusty nodded and began to spin himself down towards the central access tube . twisting his way through it , he flew forward towards the habitat module . ahead the space opened up to about the size of an airstream . it would be spacious if it was nt filled with food , sleeping bunks , and science equipment . he stopped for only a moment to grab his music player on the way by . newline newline moving bowward he glanced at the mission clock . newline newline date : 02141977 newline total mission time : t 36:02:36:14 newline lares flyby time : t 4:12:17:57 newline theia insertion burn : t 5:08:59:33 newline newline reaching the front of the ship , he passed through the open docking adaptor to the lander , osprey . inside the conical spacecraft , a lanky man with graying hair held a long lens out of the ship s largest window . newline newline  how s she doing frank ?  he asked as he clicked the button . newline newline  i m actually trying to get some good shots of lares .  he commented without looking away . rusty bent his head to catch a glimpse of the thick blue crescent . the adorable little water world followed earth around in its orbit , sitting in the creatively named l5 lagrange point , a balancing point where the gravity between the earth and the sun were equal . a little smaller than mars , thiea had the luck to catch the oblong gray shape now sitting in front of it , a large asteroid named lares . they always called theia earth s little sister . if that was true then lares was the moon s little brother . an oblong rock about 400 miles wide , the rock lazily lumbered around theia , helping stabilize the tumbling planet and lining itself up perfectly for their flyby on sunday . newline newline  god i m jealous of hera iii .  rusty mumbled as he stared . frank nodded . unfortunately hera ii was only an orbiter mission . they were going to fly around the tiny blue orb for ten days , dump the test lander on the surface unmanned , photograph the simple green plants that grew there , then head home . still humanity s first interplanetary mission , still 60 days of capsule time . yet they would still be forgotten under the glory that was going to be the hera iii manned landing . newline newline  agreed .  frank snapped another photo ,  first apollo 8 then this , i m starting to think deke does nt want me on the surface .  an image of the stoic astronaut selector leader flashed in his head . newline newline  well you know there s always at chance at the aphrodite program .  newline newline  heh , no they ll put some rookie in one of those seats instead of me . . . we apollos are getting old you know .  newline newline  do nt remind me .  rusty stuck the headphones in his ears and clicked play on the tape . he smiled and watched the silent planet approach to the tune of elo s mr. blue sky .mr . incredible . the man , the myth , the legend . he was probably the greatest superhero of all time . comic book heroes had nothing on his super strength , and together his his family of super s , they were able to keep the world a safer place . newline newline their biggest fight had yet to come . the underminer , and his henchman  the gardener  had just revealed their presence to the world . newline newline mr . incredible knew he could not face them alone , and so he called on his family to help him . the fight was long and took place throughout the city , but finally they managed to overcome the underminer and end his reign of terror . it turned out that the underminer was once just a normal mole , until the gardener was able to mutate him into a 50 foot monster capable of not only walking and talking , but of building a giant machine capable of burying entire cities under the ground . newline newline after defeating the underminer , mr . incredible told him family to go home . the search for the gardener would probably take some time . he hugged his family and sent them home , kissing his wife goodbye and telling her to keep dinner warm for him so he could eat when he returned . newline newline little did he know that the gardener was watching him this whole time . few people knew mr . incredible s only weakness , but the gardener had spent years obsessing over supers and their weaknesses , so that no one could defeat the underminer . he served as the underminer s planner , the person who plotted everything yet received none of the credit . but his time of being in the shadows had ended . now that the underminer had been defeated he knew he had to make a splash . he could nt let his life s work be unrecognized . newline newline mr . incredible searched the underminer s dead carcass . he found a piece of paper in his pocket with an address . he figured it was probably the best clue he was going to get , and headed off in the direction of the address . newline newline when he arrived , he found himself staring at a house . there was nothing special about the house , but he did nt want to just barge right in . he looked in the windows . no one seemed to be home . he cautiously opened the door and looked around . nothing . he went from room to room , finding no evidence that anyone lived there . newline newline he walked into the master bedroom and found himself in a room with hundreds of pictures . all of them were of his family . the underminer must have been following him for years . he glanced around and saw pictures from every moment of his life going back three years . he glanced at one picture , and saw him sitting at his desk in the insurance office , looking miserably out the window . another group of pictures showed his journey to defeat syndrome . he wondered how in the hell that they were able to get so many pictures of him . it was almost like a movie , telling a story of his life . newline newline he then realized there was a table in the middle of the room , with a photo album on it . he walked over and picked it up . as he looked through the book he began to get more and more stressed out . he began to breathe harder and harder . the book was pages and pages of pictures from afar of his wife cheating on him . frozone , gazerbeam , gamajack . he continued to flip through the book faster and faster as he realized that his wife had slept with almost every single super while they were married . the pictures were not the only evidence . text messages and emails littered the pages , all too vulgar for mr . incredible to even comprehend . he slammed the book shut and threw it out the window . it shattered and continued on for at least two miles . newline newline mr . incredible realized that his chest was hurting . he was short of breath . he fell to his knees , vision straining , looking for help . as he struggled to breathe , he opened his eyes and saw the gardener enter the room . he gasped out  why ?  and then returned to his struggle for breath . his chest pain was getting more intense by the second . newline newline the gardner stood over him laughing .  every single super has a weakness . some were easy to figure out , while others required a bit more work . you are so devoted to your family mr . incredible that i knew it would be your downfall .  newline newline mr . incredible gasped for air , but it was a loosing battle . darkness was beginning to envelop him . he realized it was over . he would not survive . newline newline the gardener watched as mr . incredible took his last breath , and then went cold . the cause of death ? a broken heart , triggered by the intense shock of realizing his wife was not the person he thought she was . the ultimate betrayal . mr . incredible was indeed the greatest superhero . his only weakness was himself . the gardener dialed 911 and alerted the police that they would find a body at the address he was calling from . he would finally get the recognition he deserved all along . newline newline newline thanks for reading . currently working on a book based off a wp . visit rtheinfection to read it  i

you the tale of the only man who could truly master the metal beasts that once roamed the earth . once tamed , the metal beasts would carry us from one place to another . they were ferocious , though

only woldorf , the master of traffic could tame the beasts . with a simple flick of his wrist , his white gloves of command would make them turn left or right . with a simple blow of his whistle of

natural selection in action  . newline newline all was well in the kingdom until the day of the subaru . t was a dark day in the kingdom . rain lashed the hard , paved ground like the inquisitor lashes unbelievers . lightning cracked the sky like the executioner cracks the skulls of the criminals we convict . the metal beasts pounded the ground like we have all , at one time or another , pounded eddie s mother . but unlike eddie s parentage , nothing was uncertain on this day . terror was in the air . newline newline the subaru , a wild , untameable creature , had refused to stop at the signalling lights . it had not slowed down by the command of the roadsigns . it had overtaken on the right as was forbidden by law . it was an ugly , oversized , unruly animal . woldorf raised his gloves to halt the beast . and the beast could do nothing but obey . newline newline the rainslicked ground was slippery and the great rubber feet  despite the authority of woldorf s command , could do nothing to halt its progress . it spun , throwing rain and rock in the air , getting closer and closer to the moment when  newline newline well who fucking told you that was going to happen , eddie

glass exploded out and in . screeching and howling splintered the very air as the subaru rolled , out of control , unstoppable towards the white gloved hero of the streets . woldorf stood tall as the beast was nearly upon him when he saw the child . crossing the road to get a ball . in the path of the beast . woldorf reached out , the tips of his fingers nearing the cloth of the child s shirt , wanting nothing but his safety . he threw himself forward to push and  newline newline right . fuck this . no , eddie . you had your goddamn chance . ruining one hole ai nt good enough for you ? you

matthew got back home , he at first thought his apartment had been robbed . his dresser drawers were upturned and emptied , his mattress flipped , his couch cushions pulled away from the couch . the soil from his fern s clay pot had even been dumped out , leaving moist black smears in the white carpet . the chaos was thoroughgoing and ruthless . but as matthew s initial shock wore off and he took a mental inventory , nothing appeared to be missing . newline newline it did nt take very long after that for matthew to connect this incident to his first day working for derrodyne inc . landing that internship had been a coup de grace  he beat 30 other candidates from universities across the country for the position . now he wondered if working under the wing of harvey harver would be worth this sort of risk . whoever had turned matthew s apartment insideout had wanted to send a message , foremost : had wanted to intimidate matthew for reasons he could nt grasp . was this a competitor , a career criminal , nsa , shadowy chinese spies ? a rejected candidate jealous of losing ? how many bullets is a bullet point on your resume worth to you ? matthew wondered . newline newline before doing anything else , matthew called his manager . newline newline  mr . harver ?  newline newline  matt ! matt my man . what is it ?  newline newline matthew s voice trembled , despite himself .  someone broke into my apartment . nothing s missing , but they went through all my stuff . the place is totally destroyed . and  i think whatever data was on my computers might be compromised .  newline newline there was a long pause during which all matthew heard was harver s breathing . matthew felt a hot sense of shame , as if he had let harver down . newline newline  have you reported this to the police ?  newline newline  not yet , mr. harver . i ll call them   newline newline  do nt . i ll be right over .  newline newline harver brought a thumb drive and showed matthew how to use some simple diagnostic tools to check if files on his computer had been accessed recently . newline newline  they were smart , but not too smart ,  harver said , sitting at matthew s computer desk amidst the cyclonic ruin of papers , folders , and trinkets .  they dialed back the bios clock to make it look like the computer was nt used since last night . but the system s changelog shows that . they were looking through your pc .  newline newline  who s they  ?  newline newline harver glanced over his shoulder .  i ll get you a hotel room . five star . cleaning crew here first thing tomorrow

newline newline you re less than a friend , get out of my life . the walls were painted green with landscape painting scattered throughout and a beautiful white lacing on the door . a large bed invited you to sleep or not . the furniture was mismatched at best and the two things that clashed most was the victorian metal base of a aquarium and the marshall amplifier currently being used as a table for a tea cozy posing as a dolly for a vase holding a single carnation . newline newline  well fuck john why do you think i drink laserwort tea , you think i like the way that shit tastes ! ?

newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinethe ringing of the bell as the front door of the little shop opened never failed to give dave anxiety . newline newline a tired looking young lady dressed in last year s fashions , with thick , straight , waist length chestnut hair came in , a nervous look on her face . newline newline  morning , here for a trim ?  dave asked , trying to keep up the pretence of being happy to practice his trade .  fuck me , look at that mane , this one wo nt be easy  , he thought as he got up from the thickly padded barber s chair , the steel buckles of the wrist and arm straps jangling as his watch strap slid over them . newline newline  yeah . i just got a new job in a factory , and they told me my hair needs to be kept short .  she smiled , but it did not disguise the fear in her eyes . newline newline  well , i will do my best to have you shorn as quickly and painlessly as is possible .  dave said with a smile , trying to reassure her . they both knew that it would nt be quick or painless , but people have to keep up appearances . newline newline  please sit down , make yourself comfortable , and sign these release forms on the xed lines . i ll be a few minutes getting ready ,  dave said as he started to flick several covered toggle switches mounted on the wall . newline newline the first switch changed the front glass of the shop from clear to opaque . the second activated a powerful maglock on the front door of the shop . the third piped soothing spa music to the inside of the shop , and out past the heavy sound deadening material in the walls , a loud , vibrant orchestral piece  a little sign of respect to the neighbourhood . the fourth turned on a bright red in session sign outside the shop , to try and discourage good samaritans from making a nusicense of themselves when the screaming started . finally , the fifth activated the four security cameras mounted in each corner or the room , to provide an accurate record in case of any post procedure litigation that came dave s way . newline newline the shop being ready , dave s three part ritual moved to the second stage  preparing himself and his equipment . he found it funny to look at pictures of barbers and stylists from the past , and see what they wore . street clothes and smocks , dave thought to himself as he slid the thick , black leather butcher s apron and gauntlet gloves on . without them , dave would nt own a stitch of clothing without vomit or blood soaked into them . newline newline it was hard to believe how pleasant a haircut must have been fifty years ago , back before people s hair changed , and getting a hair cut off was like getting a finger cut off . oh , the ability to grow hair did nt evolve like the hair itself did . no , no , that damned weed still shot up from the head like there was no tomorrow . newline newline the rich were lucky enough to be able to be put under and get electrolysis , while the poor were left to suffer the indignity and frankly , torture of monthly amputations without effective anaesthetic . it was strange to look at all the old magazines and photos of celebrities with full heads of hair  in stark contrast to the spear bald starlets of today . newline newline the last part of dave s pre cut ritual , as he returned to the chair , was preparing the patient . checking that the forms were in order , dave said to the girl ,  i have to secure you to the operating chair . it s for both your security and safety , and mine . do you give me consent to do so ?  newline newline the girl gave it , and dave began to attach and tighten the heavy duty belted straps down across the patient s feet , legs , thighs , chest , forehead , arms , and wrists . newline once secured , dave wheeled his table of tools over , put in a pair of earplugs , put on a pair of noise cancelling bluetooth headphones , and set to work . newline newline dave liked to listen to classical music while he operated . the intricate pieces made him feel full of energy , and general lack of vocals helped him concentrate on the task at hand . newline newline even though he was good at tuning them out , the faces his clients made never failed to surprise him while he worked . pure , unadulterated agony , in the very literal sense of the word . it was only by being able to completely isolate himself from the noise of the room , that he was able to continue with his craft . during the roughly biannual lawsuit that would inevitably crop up , dave , along with the rest of the courtroom would be forced to listed to view the footage from the security cameras . newline newline the audio was by far the worst . screaming , shouting , pleading , animal noises that no human being outside of a delivery room , battlefield , or barber shop had ever had cause to make . sometimes they would pass out mid styling , which made things much easier for dave . newline newline finishing up , the cher hair now replaced with a simple pixie cut , dave stepped back from the girl , putting his scissors into the tank of bactine to be disinfected . she was stronger than he expected . sure , tears were steadily pouring down her face , and she had nearly bitten her bottom lip off trying to withstand the pain , but she had nt completely lost control like so many of dave s customers usually did . newline newline  there , all done .  dave said , sliding the headphones off and pulling out the plugs . usually he kept them in until the client was picked up by their friends or relatives , but this one had gone well , so he did nt figure it was needed this time . newline newline  th..thanks ... looks good ...  she said shakily as dave held up the hand mirror to show her her new look . the giant mirrors that used to grace barbershops and salons had quickly fallen by the wayside once the change occurred . newline newline  who is going to pick you up ? your parents ?  dave asked , hanging up the apron and gauntlets . newline newline the girl nodded , and dave moved to the bank of switches , and began to deescalate his practice . newline newline as the fifteen year old honda sedan pulled away from the street in front of dave s shop , whisking the girl home to recover , dave leaned against the shatterproof glass of his shop , a cigarette nestled between his lips , and mused .  another satisfied customer ,  he thought ironically . newline newline it never got any easier . newline newline uhhhh , what happened  , jaden asked with his voice rasping . the last thing he remembered was lying down to get sleep and dreaming about the screaming crowds of fan girls he  d be entertaining the next day . aches cropped up from his head to his toes in all of his joints as he began to stir . the ringing in his ears was no longer a haze in the dream , but a side effect of his unconscious transportation . newline newline the world slowly spun into focus and he jolted his body . the arm restraints chaffed his skin and his pajama pants rustled against the smooth metal table beneath him . the cool metal at his back and the air on his chest let him know his shirt had been removed . he was in some sort of laboratory with a vast array of assorted wood carving tools lining the tray beside him . newline newline  ah , you  re awake doll 32a  , came the familiar voice of jaden  s father , will smith . newline newline  dad ? what did you call me  , jaden strained as he struggled against his bindings . he yelped at the feeling of his raw skin twisting inside the merciless metal bindings . he coughed as his breath caught in his chest ,  i  ll miss the concert !  newline newline  you need to , doll 32a . you are malfunctioning . your crafter and i decided we need to move you into a plastic body like your  sister  doll . it  s much less rigid  , will explained as he moved into view casting his broad shadow over his son  s twisting body . newline newline  no , dad , you  ve lost your mind ! i  m not a doll . it  s me , jaden  , the teen boy whined as his face contorted in horror to see the strange flat tool his father was holding . his scream soon filling the air as he felt the tool press into his chest , but there was no pain . the tool simply exposed the seamless lines that intersected the young man  s chest . newline newline  ah , i wish you would have been such a good actor on after earth  , will sighed as he peeled open the wooden latch that held shut jaden  s chest . prying it apart he laid his eyes upon the glowing orb that contained jaden  s personality matrix ,  i think we  ll edit your persona just a bit . don  t worry . this won  t hurt and you  ll wake up much more  realistic  .  newline newline  dad , no ! i am real  , jaden screamed as he felt will  s hands close around the orb that contained his personality . all his memories , his thoughts , and experiences imprinted on a rewritable sphere of information . as the warmth left his exquisitely carved wooden body he sighed with despair ,  but  i was . the coolest of the coolest  newline newline  he takes after me that way . perhaps i won  t edit him too much  , will sighed and turned the sphere in his hand . jaden  s new body was waiting for its  data  .  perhaps  , thought will ,  this change will be an improvement . i open the door and look around . a few dozen people peer at the door , a slight grin grows on their faces as they realize another brother has come . a soft melody rings in the air when i ask ,  is thatfranz schreker ?   of course , we need to drown out that ringing in our ears , it drives us crazy . schreker , maher , wagner . all of our favorites are playing.  they are all well dressed , silk suits and wool jackets . combed hair and a polished completion . a warm smile rests on their faces . i know its fake , that  s the thing that always bugged you when you where in high school . why do people always smile , or cry , or laugh ? you never felt like they did . never jealous or upset , happy or sad . that  s why you never could keep a relationship , you where different but you didn  t know it . how could you ? it was always normal to pretend to smile , pretend to be happy . newline they paint a smile on their faces . a condescending grin that encapsulates them like a mask . one approaches me and shakes my hand .  it  s a pleasure to meet you !   no it isn  t ,  i think to myself .  why would it be a fucking pleasure ?  the only time i could ever say it was a pleasure to meet someone was 11th grade in rachel  s basement .  of course  is what i actually say . it  s what i always say . i always grin and play happy . you look over and see a splendid sight newline a grand library looms deep into the heart of the building . grey  s anatomy , biology textbooks , i can  t help but to grin when i see that beautiful book . i glaze my hand over the words , kinder und hausmrchen . i approach a castle and a man takes me down into a vault . gentle where his footsteps . i felt liberated from the world , like i was able to be me . but it  s not the me i pretend to be . no , this is personal . as i continue i can  t help but to feel at home . i see pain , destruction , and blood on the walls . a mirror of my true self . i see the butcher shop , my favorite job . the hospital where i had my hand sewn back together , my fondest memory from middle school . then i see it , the last room . the smell of blood is overbearing . while i  m disgusted , i  m also happy . truly at home . then my heart sank . newline the door shuts and the light goes out . there he was , in a leather chair . it wasme . not like me , not resembling me . it was me . he stood up and came a few centimeters from my face . he looks into my eyes and reached into his jacket . he pulls out a knife and smiles . his words i will always remember ,  are you ready ?  a long pause hung in the air . my heart still as stone , cold and burning . he began to laugh and said in a calm voice ,  welcome homewelcometo the darkness . with a flash , everything changed .  newline newline  captain ! not meaning to disturb you , but the sensors have detected movement twentyfour clicks out , multiple blinks . looks like they just came through warp .  stated jeffrey , with the same harmless expression on his face that he always has . jeffrey has rod with the fleet since he was 14 , being on the navigation throughout his career . he proved himself to be a reliable man both on and off deck , which is why captain moved him on his personal starship , the ss bonzai . newline newline  captain , it looks like there are very many ships , dozens ! my advice is to hail them on the communication channel , it seems like this was not a regulated jump !  newline newline  establish a communication line through the bridge , open it to any ships willing to accept . lock on to their jump location , move our fleet into their fly zone . mohammad , get a comm line up with the empire , see if there are any regulations on these jumps .  the captain issued , with a hint of stress in his voice . captain jason bones never liked having to deal with unregulated ships in his quadrant , especially on this caliber . jason opened his comm line to ss shibbywan and the truck , and issued kaizer and thomas to prepare their shields and weapons . jason was not going to take any chances . newline newline  kaizer , i need you to lock your ion cannons on the outer ships . we ca nt have them jump further into the solar system before we know what s going on  you need to stop as many as you can from moving if that needs be . thomas , distribute your main power sources to your shield and anti missile systems , put yourself in front of us and make them focus you if that needs be .  with the orders in place , the ships moved to the direction of the jumps . the tension could be felt in the air , slicing through the ease of the day . even calm jeffrey was a little tense after hearing the captain issue those commands . newline newline  there are many ships , captain ! an uncountable number ! we ca nt get an accurate read on the ship makes or their target trajectory !  jeffrey beconed from his communication station . newline newline  stay on course . mohammad , get on the manual weapon systems .  of course this has to happen today . it was suppose to be an easy floating day . we were suppose to shut down and float for days to our next outlier planet .  newline newline the ss bonzai has been flying at the edge of the solar system since it was colonized by humans 3 years ago , scouting possible jump routes and relaying with outlier planets . with her flew two ships  ss shibbywan , a scavenging vessel rebuilt for military use piloted under the enthusiastic kaizer and the truck , a heavily militarized transport ship commanded by dr. thomas . there was maybe twenty eight crew members spread across all three vessels  with so many coming and going off during missions on outlier planets , there was no point for jason to keep track . the empire did not issue the captain much in terms of fleet strength , but they have been able to make due with what they had . to the captain , being in the sky was all that mattered . newline newline  twelve clicks out , no response on the communication system from the jumpers . still no read on their ship makes , no tags  empire nor outlaw . could be their systems are outdated to the point where they do nt have tags or a long range comm system .  jeffrey always was optimistic about situations like this . newline newline  stay on course . open a comm line to the truck and shibbywan .  newline newline  open line , sir !  newline newline  kaizer on comm .  newline newline  hello yes . this is thomas truck on comm . how are you .  thomas muffled over the communication line . it was always a little awkward talking with thomas over communication lines . or in person . i guess that s what 15 years of studying astrophysics will do to you .  newline newline  thomas , allocate power to your engines and accelerate past us . get within 3 clicks and open a comm line between the jumpers and your ship . if you make contact , establish a link between the bonzai and their ship . kaizer , keep shibbywan protected . stay within half a click and lock ion cannons on weapon systems , we will handle the jumps when they happen .  newline newline  yes . thomas will do that . i can do fast movement in ship . ok three minute .  despite being off , thomas was as reliable as jeffrey . they were both brothers , coming from an outlier planet that held about 2000 people . mostly resource miners , it was a steal when the empire recruited them . newline newline from the bridge of the bonzai the captain could see the 16 thrusters of the truck activate and zip the ship off . despite being a mockery of an actual warship , the truck could move . fast . newline newline  newline newline  hello yes . this is thomas , communication line up for talking . hello yes you should talk . hello .  thomas repeated this several times while hovering within 3 clicks of the jumpers . there was maybe 50 ships , and more were jumping in behind the initial ships . thomas could nt make out the manufacturer of the ships or the purpose of their design . they neither had recognizable weapon or resource extraction systems , and their hulls seemed ancient . something did nt feel right for thomas . newline newline as he repeated himself over the comm line again , there was a flash of blinding white light  and then the ship felt as if it had just collided with an asteroid . the ship shook , hard , swerving sideways . thomas hit the inertia dampers and redistributed his thrusters to balance out the truck . haha , truck can take hit .  newline newline  kaizer that did not feel good . kaizer how is you . kaizer did they shoot .  thomas questioned over the comm line . kaizer will be behind thomas , ready for fighting . kaizer like fight .  newline newline there was no response . newline newline looking out of the bridge of the ship , thomas saw ss shibbywan was split directly in half . perfect cut , dead center . uhoh .  newline newline  newline newline i ll continue if there is interest ! newline newlinei crack my neck and pull my keyboard towards me , my time in the limelight has finally come ! newline  alrighty brain , it s time to put you to good use !  newline  no  newline  but brain , we ve got so much going on up there , why not let other people see it ?  newline  i do nt wan na .  newline  come on , it ll be fun ! we ca nt lurk forever you know !  newline  fuck that , you ve got to drive to work in five minutes , numbnuts . just write a quick shitpost and get the fuck out , we do nt like people , remember ?  newline  i thought we were trying to work on that ...  newline  click save right now or i m bringing up that time in middle school whe  newline  alright alright , fine ! christ on a cracker , you re an asshole . the shot echoed around the warehouse just after the bullet tore through christopher s chest . his revolver fell to the diamondplate walkway and he fell after it , a crimson stain spreading across his back . still in standing in the place she was when she shot the villain was our hero . adorned in heavy metal armor and wielding what looked like a shotgun was the phantom . the beast of the east . the devil in disguise . i feel as if the nicknames are enough of an explanation . newline newline  back , back ,  i hissed , pushing the few survivors behind me on the walkway . the phantom marched forward and retrieved the revolver , examining it with steelcolored eyes . she stuffed it into the bag on her hip and approached me , each step bringing the warmachine closer . those who did nt know her would nt be frightened by her appearance  she stood around fivefoot and looked more like an angsty teenager than anything else . newline newline but all of us knew the atrocities she had committed . in her defense , we had committed similar atrocities ourselves . she was nt her to stop christopher , she was here to kill us . newline newline  out of the way ,  her voice turned my blood to ice . one of the more gutsy men pushed his way past me and stood before her . newline newline  you ll have to get  she fired and i was showered in blood and pieces of bone . the man , now minus a good chunk of his head , slumped back against me , forcing me to the floor . the phantom stepped over me , placing her boot firmly on my chest . newline newline  i m looking for abraham hughs ,  she growled the name ,  any of you  she paused , glancing over her shoulder at something ,  right ,  she whispered , as if someone had told her something . there were claims of her insanity , but i had expected them to be just that . newline newline  here s the deal , i want to kill every last one of you , but i do nt want to go through a box of ammo ,  she pulled the magazine out of the shotgun ,  you tell me who knows where hughs is , and i ll leave .  newline newline  ii do ,  marcus pushed his way through the crowd . the young scout had found the warlord s territory in the past and had kept it a close guarded secret . i wanted to yell at him , to remind him that the shotgun still had a single round chambered in it , but that would only fuel the phantom s rage . newline newline  why do you need hughs ?  marcus asked . the kid had guts , standing face to face with the beast of the east , asking her a question instead of answering her own . there was a brief flicker of sadness , of humanity , across the monster s face , but the blank slate returned . newline newline  because ,  she said , stepping up to the scout ,  because , i need to find him , cut open his back , yank his lungs out , and watch him die . slowly . so you d better tell me where he is or you ll get the same treatment .  newline newline  he s about a mile east of the ruins of atlanta , in a fortified cit  the shotgun rang out once more and marcus fell to the walkway , clutching his ears . sliding the shotgun back onto her belt , the phantom took a long look at all of us . newline newline  if hughs gets wind of me and disappears , i will track every last one of you down and make sure it s slow and painful ,  she stepped over me again and disappeared out of the open door . hey , steve . watch this sweet shot .  larry corked his hand back , shot it forward and released the concealed crumpled ball of paper in to the air . it sailed towards the recycle bin and gracefully dropped in . newline newline  that was pretty sweet , got to give you that , but check this out .  steve crumpled two paper balls of his own and released both in to the air simultaneously , aiming for the bin . the efforts were successful . newline newline both men looked at each other , hiding their mutual respect . newline newline larry ran at the recycle bin and dove head first in to it , completely wiping out the bin and leaving a large inprint on the adjacent wall . steve , obscenely impressed , looked on blankly . newline newline the door to the room burst open .  what in the name of god is going on in here ?  it was their boss . the two idiots were at work . heads of fellow workers were peering in behind the frame of the boss who was stood at the door . newline newline larry spoke up  i am the bin now , steve .  newline newline  i do nt give a monkey s arse if you re the bin , larry .  barked their boss .  all i want to know is how the fuck are you going to top that , steve ?  newline newline the crowd of workers behind the boss erupted in to cheers and began to chant  oneup off ! oneup off ! oneup off !  newline newline steve rose from his desk , looked on at the clamouring crowd , nodded , and then ran through the wall closest to him , leaving a cartoon like outline of his body . newline newline two coworkers , who had clearly witnessed something like this before , began to commentate on the proceedings : newline newline   what we have here kyle is the first oneup off  of 2016 . it s as simple as that . there s no twoways about it .   newline newline   well , jerry , i have to agree with you . that is clearly what is happening here . we have two talented veterans of the game willing to put it all on the line for those of us in attendance .   newline newline larry rose from the bin and looked towards the dust that was still in the air from steve running through the wall . steve s face was barely visible through the debris , but he was there . he was there and he was smiling . larry could feel it . he had to respond . newline newline larry looked around the room and then made is way through the door . surrounded by colleagues , he marched over to the printer , eyed it up , and then swallowed it whole . newline newline   what ? ! are you kidding me ?   newline newline   we have not seen consumption like this for a long time ! you have to go back to 2012 when a competitor ate a child another worker had brought in to the office to even come close !   newline newline steve emerged from the rubble without a mark on him but with his pride temporarily scathed . he looked at larry and plotted his next move . he calmly walked over the nearest computer and climbed in to the monitor . newline newline   ohhh , what s happening here , kyle ? this is uncharted territory for us . never before have we witnessed a competitor insert themselves in to a computer .   newline newline larry s stomach illuminated and the mechanical noise of the printer boomed from inside of his body . newline newline   oh my god , steve is printing himself off , jerry .   newline newline their boss joined the commentary team . newline newline   good to have you , boss . what do you make of this ?   newline newline   well this is just classic steve right here . you can never look past his ingenuity when he s in the zone as he is right now .   newline newline larry s skin began to pulse as steve was being printed off from inside of him . his stomach bulged as larry tried to suppress steve s rebirth . his efforts were futile . his skin began to break as steve appeared from underneath . blood splattered around the room as steve emerged . newline newline   oh my god he even printed himself in black and white !   newline newline steve stood victorious . the office was going wild . the boss walked over to the main wall by reception and picked up a piece of chalk . newline newline steve : 321 newline newline

1988 , well it was known as lottoamerica until the early 90 s but it was essentially the same thing . 25 years ago we all started picking numbers , watching jackpots grow into the billions . the lottery can turn you into one of the richest 250 people in the world ! well , hold on , it could , if it existed . yes i know , scratch offs are real , but those are small denominations that trick you into thinking the larger ones pay out . i m talking about the jackpots though . where are they ? ! newline newline 25 years of powerball . 1 drawing a week for 25 years . that s 56 billions dollars ! 1,300 lottery made millionaires ! and that s just from powerball . 44 states have their own individual lotteries which  pay out  between 100,000 and 5,000,000 . new york alone has had it s own lottery going for 35 years , with 350  made millionairs   adjusting for inflation , of course  . newline newline so where are they ? there should be 4,000 millionaires living amongst us . they could just blend right in , right ? take their money , buy a house and live a normal life right ? ? eh , i do nt buy it . the lottery likes to pat itself on the back . releasing figures for how much has gone to schools , help impoverished neighborhoods , etc . so , if there was ever a winner walking around with 50 million , helping the needy , paying tuition for aspiring lower class students , and doing other charitable things the lottery would flaunt this .  hey , look our winners do amazing things !  ... ahh , of course they ca nt release who wins . that would put them at risk , right ? well , 13 of the 44 states that have the lottery have laws stating the state must release their identity . try to find a name though , i dare you . there are feel good stories out there for sure . they are made up though . 27 year old gregwhoever was a postal worker , now that he s filthy rich he wants to just  live a normal life  the 35 million dollars is  just icing on the cake  . i assure you , those would not be the real words of real winners . newline newline 80  of lottery winners end up losing it all ! how many times has a coworker told you that . it s engrained in us . just another lie . newline newline there are no winners . it s all a facade . people like to call it a tax , or that you re gambling . so many justifications given to us . you can follow tax money . you ca nt follow money that you did nt even know was stolen though ! newline newline none of us expect to win , we have never met a winner , we have never seen a 100 million dollar winner changing lives in a nearby

stopped . the cold droplets stormed down from the heavens , stinging my skin like pin pricks . even so , this sensation did nt hurt . i had already lost my ability to feel pain . the world had been reduced to a barren wasteland , and most of the living things on earth had already been killed for their valuable exp . newline they had tried to come for me , too . i managed to survive , but it came at a heavy cost . with every kill , the next one becomes just a bit easier . before you know it , you are nt killing to protect yourself . you re killing just to feel your level get higher , and to see yourself get just a bit stronger . newline newline slash , slash , slash , slash . newline newline my shining and sharp knife was stained a permanent red . i glanced at it , admiring the fresh blood . who had i just killed ... ? i ca nt even remember anymore . i continued walking this razed earth , as the rain pelted away at me . i was nearing the very end . eventually , i reached my final destination . i had reached my former home . newline as soon as i arrived , i felt his presence . he stood across from me , and stared into my eyes with disgust . as i approached , he simply stood there , never averting his cold glare . newline newline stab .  newline newline his eyes turned to surprise , and my own turned glassy . my knife pierced my chest , and mortally wounded me . newline i stumbled to the ground , letting myself bleed out . the man , my own son , had been spared from having to kill his foolish murderer of a father . newline before i died , the last thing i heard in my mind was newline newline  congratulations , level 100 has been reached.  newline newline newlineafter first contact , the first thing we learned was humility . some countries tried to nuke the nkatos . others simply refused to cooperate . these countries were gently reprimanded with the removal of three percent of their population  about fifty million lives , turned to dust . it did nt take long for us to learn to listen . newline newline fortunately , the nkatos were not a cruel race . once they collected enough samples to understand us , we as a species soon became something of exotic pets . they took great amusement in our strange , chaotic thoughts and weak , squishy bodies , and for that , we were pampered , corralled into a single continent , and protected . our needs were met , our masses were entertained , and our efforts trivialized . though our society was allowed to naturally progress , motivation plummeted as we realized how hopelessly outclassed we were . but , when the cost of serious rebellion was the removal of whole cities , people soon accepted their meaningless , comfortable lives . newline newline however , not everything was simply blind obedience to the nkatos . there was exactly one human curiosity that warranted discussion and not a cleansing  religion . they knew what our beliefs were , but could nt understand why . their head priest , nkatosonkatstaoka , offered to speak with our religious leaders , and they seized the chance to do something meaningful for the first time in years . newline newline they let our leaders speak first , listening and recording intently as we tried to explain our religions . they already knew our practices , for everything from the biggest world religious to the smallest tribal sect . really , all they were hoping for was that by speaking , we would reveal an insight previously unthought . when that proved unfruitful , they began to speak of their own religion . newline newline as they spoke , even if they still did nt understand our unreasonably strong beliefs , we began to understand theirs . who were we to deny their cosmic enlightenment ? their religion seemed to make perfect sense , so much that it was barely religion . they had transcended knowledge to where they could , and in fact had to trust that their predecessors  research was accurate , as no one mind could hold such information . as far as we could tell , though , the only theological element was their god , nkatosonkatos , who represented the true essence of all knowledge . newline newline they struggled to explain this being in detail , but the paradox of nkatosonkatos was that its existence is due to its impossibility . how can one describe the form of that which represents the indescribable ? nkatosonkatstaoka grew more and more agitated as he tried for days to impress upon our feeble minds what was the core deity of nkatos society . at last , he slammed his claws against the screen in frustration . all went silent as he announced ,  if i can not explain nkatosonkatos to you , i must show you .  newline newline in an instant , the world erupted into a cacophony , as it seemed every nkatos on earth went into an uproar . few bothered translating , but those who did spread the panic to humanity , as it was revealed that many nkatos feared for our fragile minds . billions were erased as they rioted in fear and confusion , even as billions more said their prayers . but the high priest , and the nkatos population as a whole , had made up their mind . and as the surviving population faced the sun for the final time , we realized the truth , and the last of our free will perished .it began with a simple question . newline newline  do you know why you re here ?  newline newline i placed the mug on his table .  vaguely .  newline newline  you ve been promoted . congratulations .  newline newline  ...  newline newline  you seem thrilled .  newline newline  may i ask why ? it s just ...  newline newline  out of the blue ?  newline newline i scratched the back of my head .  yeah .  newline newline the man in the navy blue suit grinned , but even i could tell it was forced .  you will be replacing senior head researcher edward weiss . you will be given level five clearance for all files and unrestricted access to the labs and testing grounds and particle colliders . all five hundred staff members are yours . you will discontinue all previous projects and start fresh . you may appoint someone as your successor , if you so wish . and ... of course ... there will be a substantial pay increase .  newline newline for some reason i felt nothing . only numbness and a tinge of confusion .  what happened to weiss ? he s one of the best around here . been with us for years .  newline newline  not years . decades .  newline newline  so why am i getting his spot ?  newline newline  you seem to be missing the point . no , this is nt an offer , doctor kent ... this is an executive order . a direct command from the council . you will accept this promotion , and you will be happy about it . you will drive home to your family with a smile on your face . do you hear me ?  newline newline  ...  newline newline  disobeying a direct council command will result in expulsion or termination .  newline newline  i accept the offer ... sir . thank you .  newline newline  good .  he ran his scrawny fingers through his cabinet and retrieved a folder . the strange thing was that the cover was blank .  very good .  newline newline  with respect , you still did nt answer my question . what happened to edward ?  newline newline he slid me the file down the slick mahogany surface .  you should read this . only seven people in the entire world know about this .  newline newline  what is it ?  i asked . newline newline  a secret .  newline newline in a place like this , that could mean anything . portals ? the existence of god ? blood rites ?  what kind of secret ?  newline newline the man snorted .  the kind that forced us to create another layer of security clearance for it .  newline newline it was a briefing on some sort of mechanical device that had taken decades to construct . thousands of scientists involved , including some prominent world leaders . i read slowly , at first , a word at a time . newline newline then it set in . newline newline the truth .  newline newline i denied it . i denied everything the document said , despite all of the evidence , the people involved , eyewitness testimonies and photos of the event . newline newline most of all ... i denied the truth because it was fucking impossible . newline newline  you understand what we re dealing with , doctor kent ? the ... gravity of our situation ?  newline newline i slammed the papers down .  is this a sick joke ? what is this ?  newline newline  no . no , it is not a joke . we are a humorless bunch , mind you .  newline newline  how many times ? how many times did we use it ?   newline newline  ... three .  newline newline my arms stiffen . newline newline three .  newline newline three times we chose to reset . three times we failed to save ourselves . newline newline i can barely hold it together .  what happened to the last timeline we were in ?  newline newline  nuclear fallout . heavy containment breach . code reds .  newline newline  jesus ...  newline newline  i suppose you need a moment  newline newline  wait .  newline newline  hmm ?  newline newline  if we all ... if we all died in universe 89b ... then how are we still alive right now ?  newline newline the man s eyes narrowed into slits .  do nt assume you re the same person .   newline newline and with that statement , he left . newline newline  what do you expect me to do ?  i shouted . newline newline the man paused .  learn . improve . study . test . experiment . record . discuss . whatever you need to do .  newline newline  you want me to fix this device ?  newline newline  no . the device is destroyed . beyond repair , were weiss  words . no , i expect you to make sure we wo nt have to resort to something like that device again . do you understand ? because we re stuck here . whether we like it or not . are we clear ?  newline newline i merely nod . newline newline  good . see you tomorrow at nine . do nt be late .  newline newline newline ... newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinei was the first to enter the forbidden city . no one dared to trespass these damned streets for what was said to be a thousand years . why i came here is beyond my memory , all i remember is the old hag cackling as i fled her run down hut . her toothless gaping maw billowing out her spineshivering howl as she called me every name under the sun . two days later i found myself at the broken iron gates of the nameless city with nary a clue of how i got here . my only indication time passed was from my watch telling me that i was missing two days of my life . newline newline to be honest , i do nt even know where the city is located in the country . i never payed attention to the maps we were shown in classes . i guess it became my downfall . with hesitation befitting a craven , i lightly stepped over the cracked pavement and became the first person to enter the city of marble . newline newline the first thing that stuck me was how the name held true . despite enduring an eon of nature s slow wrath , the vine covered marble still was as white as blinding light . it shone with an unnatural luster , or at least the parts still visible beneath the foliage . i had stepped into a large courtyard by the time i noticed the statues . by then i was too far in the retched place . i found myself next to a fountain with a magnificent statue of a cherub poised about to let fly his arrow , and he was grinning right at me .  my eyes locked his , and for the life of me , i swear his grin widened . i spun around , poised to run back to the gates when i saw another statue . this one was on the roof of a nearby building . despite the illogical placement , i saw it grin directly at me as well . that was when i heard the whisper    no escape   . i ran . newline newline i had never moved as fast in my life as i was then . as i sped through the city , i heard the scratching of stone against stone , no doubt the horrid automatons were pursuing me . whether they wanted my life or not , i had no intention of finding out . unfortunately , i would , as the gates were locked shut with another marble monstrosity barring my path . the stone satyr bore the same sickening smile as the other statues , but this one had some low pitch chuckle emanating from it , despite no visible means to do so . it was then that i heard the whisper of a hundred voices radiate from all around me    you shall join us   . newline newline so the question is , why i am i still alive ? here , talking to you as we hide out in this cursed city from the corrupted constructions ? as well as why did you come ? for the riches of the past you say , well that certainly answers the second . but the first , well you see ... newline newline i did nt survive , and neither will you .in shackles , matthias was shoved forward off of the ship by a big guard . he had never set foot on land in his life . but today , today he would experience a whole new , unfamiliar world . the crew had been captured by the king s guard navy and they would now be dealt with by these soldiers . newline newline  what re ya doin  with that there boy leads ?  said a man in colorful attire . newline  he s part o  the crew . he s a prisoner , captain .  replied the sailor newline  he s a boy . take off his restraints now .  newline  but  newline  i gave you an order . follow it .  newline  yes sir .  letting go of matthias , leads gave him a look of distaste and went back onboard to retrieve more of the crew . newline newline  what s ya name boy ?  said the captain newline looking down , matthias replied softly ,  matthias , sir .  newline  matthias ? well matthias . what re ya doin  with a group like this ? you re no pirate are ya ?  newline looking up finally at the captain , he could not feel intimidated . the man had to be over six feet tall and was broadshouldered .  sir , i do nt know of anything else . that ship , the sanora , is the only home i ve ever known .  newline  where are ya from boy , it s not the only home ya ve had .  newline  yes sir , it is . my parents bore me on that there ship and after they died . well , i never wanted to leave . and so i never have until now .  newline  well , damn son . welcome to the real world . would ya like a place to stay for the night ? i know a lady that d be keen to

yessir !  newline  take over for me . i ll be back shortly .  newline  yessir .  newline newline as they began there walk , with matthias following the captain , the man spoke ,  oh and my name s captain fields . ironic as a sailor i know .  newline  what is a fields ?  newline  damn boy . it s a big area of land , usually there s a bunch of grass . you prolly don  know what that is either . just think of a field of seaweed that you can walk on .  newline  okay .  newline  it ll be around the bend here . this madame rosemary is a fine little thing . got some spirit to her , too , if ya know what i mean boy .  newline newline matthias did not respond , instead , he finally took in his surroundings for the first time . he felt no sway beneath him and it bothered him a bit . he felt as if he was not in balance with the flooring beneath him . and every step they took farther away from the docks , the less salty the air became . he had never known of the air to not fill with the rich salt that he was accustomed to all of his life . newline newline instead of the familiar salt , rich smells of freshly baked food filled his nostrils . foods like baked bread and pastries came to view as he equated each smell to its owner . in awe of the deliciousness of these new objects . matthias stopped and just soaked in his environment . newline a few feet ahead , the captain had realized that the boy was no longer beside him .  boy ! stop dilly dallying and get a move on it . we ai nt got all day !  newline hastening to catch up , matthias apologized for the delay . newline newline letting his mind wander again , matthias saw many new places as the pair walked up the street to their destination . he had seen the buildings and people from afar , but he never imagined such intricacy and depth to this new world . many new types of objects used for different applications he had never seen before . and as they walked up the cobblestone , he noticed a vibrantly colored section of the row of buildings they had been walking along for some time now . newline newline the captain stopped ahead of him and turned around .  we ve reached the destination . let me introduce you to madame rosemary .  newline  yes sir .  newline newline ... newlinegetting out of hand , newline the way i feel . newline all the layers of me , newline that you peel . newline so do nt pinch me

anyway hehe ...  newline newline the warrior was standing over me and man he was impressive . i mean im pretty jacked from the weekly trips to the gym but he was definetly in another league . if i was

reached me his hand . i tried to lift mine but all i could do was gurgling out blood . newline newline  oh i forgot..  newline newline olaf started to put back my intestines into my body . when he was

newline newline  my cobra got shot down by an igla in afghanistan .  newline newline  what has your snake to do with your death ?  newline newline  i mean my chopper got shot down .  newline newline  whats a chopper ? sounds like a berserker who likes to cut things .  newline newline  olaf , when did the last warrior arrive in valhalla ?  newline newline  that must have been 1200 something .  newline newline i sighed , no wonder he didnt know what i was talking about . we sat down and i started to tell him what happened in the last 800 years . when i was finished it was already getting

welcome to the 21th century ...  newline newline  loki be cursed , its already getting dark . we have to get back to the great hall .  newline newline  great hall ?  newline newline  yes the hall were we feast and drink . but only real warriors are supposed to sit at the table . and judging from your tellings you have no idea how to fight with a sword , spear or axe .  newline newline  well , i know how to use a knife .  newline newline  prove it .  newline newline olaf threw me a knife and we both readied our weapons . with a fearsome battlecry he lunged at me . i dodged to the side and cut his arm . he tried to hit me with a second strike and i ducked under it and rammed the blade into his chest . he started to spit blood but grabbed me with both of his arms . newline newline i couldnt move and he started to crush me with his bro hug . i could hear my bones crack when he suddenly stopped and let go of me . newline newline  that should do . not bad considering you have been fighting with this toy . some practice and you can take it with every warrior here . now come , a feast is awaiting us .  newline newline we walked to a castle and entered it . inside was a huge hall , rich with ornaments and decorations . the tables reached from one end of the room to the other and there must have been enough space for thousands of people . between the tables beautiful maidens in artful armors were walking up and down and serving food and mead to the warrirors . newline newline i followed olaf and we both took seat . newline newline  olaf ! ! ! where have you been ?  newline newline another warrior at the table gretted him . newline newline  i was picking up a new warrior einar .  newline newline  a new warrior ? you dont mean this weakling ?  newline newline the muscular giant pointed at me . newline newline  frank might look like a weakling but he is good with a knife . almost defeated me while attacking head on .  newline newline the other warriors started to laugh . one of the put a horn filled with mead in fron of me . newline newline  in this case , welcome in valhalla frank . a toast to our newest warrior ! ! ! !  newline newline everyone lifted their horns , toasted and drank it without putting it down . i tried my best but started to choke . newline newline olaf patted on my back . newline newline  yeah , we got ta work on this too .  newline newline i finished coughing and one of the maidens refilled my horn with mead . newline newline  so , what are you guys doing here all day ?  newline newline  what every man dreams of . we feast and drink , sleep , fight at daylight and in the evening we feast and drink again .  newline newline olaf bumped me into my side . newline newline  you will like it here , trust me .  newline newline  and sometimes we will even get to know the valkyries a little bit better , if you catch my meaning .  the warrior said with a wink . newline newline i lifted my horn again . newline newline well , sounds like its not that bad after all .i remember the first time we met . newline newline i knew from the moment she walked in the store that she was my destiny . the quaint little stationary shop on main street was closing down , bought out by a new chain of computer stores . the day we first met was bright and warm , nothing that reflected my inner turmoil at the prospect of remaining unsold . my price tag reflected my loneliness  it had been slashed through again and again , yet i still remained in that dusty corner untouched . newline newline she was the first to notice me . her face dipping down , she wiped off the months of neglect . her eyes examined me carefully . i sat as still as possible , hoping that she found no faults in the black metal casing or the round letter keys . my heart stilled as her hands rested on me  it was a weight that gave me comfort . ever so delicately , she began to press the keys . a ding  rang out as she said her first words to me . newline newline  will you be my escape ? i was born different . newline newline now that i think about it , i always had this strange , powers , since i was little , i just never cared enough about it to consider what it means . newline newline it all changed when i was 15 . newline newline it was on my highschool days , some kind of cultural festival where classes turned into booths and we compete against each other to get the most visitors . our class theme was stage magic  , and i was tasked as the stage magician . but my power went out of control , and the rabbit i was supposed to pull out of the magician s hat turned onto the spectators  head . newline newline it s a good thing they laughed it off , but i know better : i have to control this power somehow . newline newline i researched the net , my power was called  space displacement  , better known as teleport . i also found out a facility focused on training special , talents , like mine . it was called project cataclysm . newline newline the young , unsuspecting me immediately enrolled to the program , which proved into disastrous idea . the member of the program was ranked based on the level of control and scale of the ability from g to a to s , at the time i enrolled , there were only one brank member . i was ranked f from the getgo . now ? i m one of just three srank member of the project , member with ability to cover an entire continent or more . the other two was both clairvoyance and psychiatic manipulation , as such they pose no threat to the current me . newline newline now , i hold the entire planet on my hands , i could freely displace any object which used planet earth as reference point . yes , including your blood , i could freely displace each and every cells of it . i wonder , what would happen if i just removed the entire red blood cells from your system . newline newline what ? what can you do to me anyway , drank psychokinesis albert foundry ? anything you throw to me i would just teleport , not necessarily away , i could just reverse it s direction . newline newline why i do this , you say ? newline newline if i as much as wished for it , i could assemble the world leader and hold this entire world hostage , let s see , threatening to displace the earth core or the moon sounds like a good idea . i could call myself a god and no one would doubt it , heck , for all intent and purpose , right now i am your god . newline newline and yet i did nt do that . newline newline i could get anything i want , and yet i ca nt get you . newline newline why ca nt you just understand ? newline newline i hold the power to destroy just about everything , i could ruin this world without so much as flicking my finger . newline newline but i do nt destroy anything . i do nt destroy the world . because you still exist in this world . newline newline because of you . newline newline because i love you . newline newline why ca nt you understand ? newline newline why you , you ask ? newline newline because when everyone else hated me , feared me just because i have this power , you re the only one that talked to me as a human being . when everyone else seen me as a monster , you look at me as the girl griselda teline . newline newline when everyone left me alone , you wiped my tears . newline newline and yet not even you understand . not even you were able to see past the srank teleporter title . newline newline i have removed your handcuff . you re free now . newline newline and please , be happy . you re forbidden of any emotion other than happiness . be happy , for me , too . newline newline he has gone . and now i have no reason to stay here . newline newline he had seen me as a girl when they saw me as a monster . he was the only one who shed tears when i was hurt , when not even i myself cried , he had cried for me . newline newline i closed the bunker door . newline newline and never to open it again . newline newline excerpts from local newspaper , sunday , july 10th 2107 newline  a girl was found dead on an abandoned warehouse after local citizens heard a series of explosion coming from the warehouse . the forensic investigation suggest the usage of electrogravitic explosive , but the police refused to release further statement . the girl was identified as griselda teline , 21 years old , unemployed and a former srank member of project cataclysm , the secret government project to develop supernatural power ... .the little boy leaped off the sill so gayly that even peter had to step back in breathless awe and murmur to himself : newline newline  damn , that s gay .  newline newline and then gravity reached up like a running back , caught the boy around his plump little gay body , and slammed him into the pavement like a completed touchdown . newline newline he wakes up . he s sitting up in bed . he s screaming . newline newline his dad rushes in and tries to suffocate him with the pillow .  shut up ! shut up ! i m trying to sleep , damnit !  newline newline his mom manhandles his dad off him and throws him out the room . then she spends the next few minutes soothing him until he s well enough to tell her about the dream . newline newline  that s impossible dear ,  she cooes over his sobs .  peter pan died years ago . slipped right off the edge of the window sill and broke his neck .  she pats his head and kisses his forehead .  i ll take you to see the grave site , right after school . it s not too far from here . sweet dreams , my dear .  newlinenewline  i just ca nt except allowing these degusting creatures into the federation ! under no terms will these monsters be allied with the ner ! a passage of article 438 is a declaration of secession by the ner from the federation !  jenk finished his speech , smoothed his feathers and took his place allowing the other members of the council to speak . newline newline newline newline jenk knew that a secession could never happen even if the article passed . the hope was to limit and restrain these newcomers from gaining a foot hold in the galaxy . the ner need the federation . it was the only reason they still existed . 5 microcycles since war had come to his home world and with it nightmares . never before had a foreign power invaded . never before was the federation needed more than now . newline newline newline newline  as per the terms of the halt treaty , this federation has to allow them membership . this we all understand.  trel was from a close neighboring star state , chak . an allie to the ner more so than most in this conceal . jenk knew that from the twitch of trels mandibles he could count on their vote .  long has it stood for the betterment of it citizens . i do not feel article 438 is up to the standard of which the federation stands for , and wish to open a dialog for amendments  newline newline newline newline there it was , just what jenk planed . the ner could not put forth the motion for fear of being seen as bias . now the restraints could be put in place . the fist requirement needed to be a relinquishing of armed forces , and disarmament of the boarder . the federation was mostly peaceful , none of the other star states had their own standing army . second was economics , monetary conversions , and exports . the federation was uniformed . assimilation would take a few microcycles . newline newline newline newline  a motion for amendments has been called . is there a 2nd ?  halth the council elder was straight forward . eldest of the council members , having no time for political banter . newline newline newline newline  2nded !  jenk spoke taking a stand . newline newline newline newline  are there any amendments ready to for debate ?  halth was following protocol to the letter . adjusting the items on his lectern .  no ? we will take a 40tic recess . all amendments should be ready when we resume . newline newline newline  newline newline newline newline jenk was ready , plumage groomed , breast plate shinning . formal wear was required for state dinners . being invited to such a high profile event , only the best attire would be appropriate . there was trel adorned in the customary chak gems strung about their setae speaking to the newcomers council member . this was the place to be , the event history would record . all the council members in their finest conversing with the most powerful privet beings of the federation . gatherings such as these are where policy is formed . newline newline newline newline  jenk ! sir jenk !  roaring from across the room council member richards was a beast . his head almost touching the celling . never before had jenk felt so venerable then when being near a human . newline newline newline  ah sir richards ! so nice to see you again . i sure its been well over a microcycle.  jenk was not here for small talk . it would be impossible for another species to derive so much pleasure from it as humans . newline newline newline  sir jenk , i need to speak to you about the coming council meeting . i need you to bring forward this article proposal.  richards exclaimed . newline newline newline jenk was taking a back at such directness . richard pulled a data card from his odd formal wear . passing it to jenk , he unlocked the screen and stepped back . jenk was appalled at what was in the article . a call to seal the records of the last war of ner and pardon those investigated for war crimes . how could richards conceive this offensive ideal . jenk looked to richards , and those around them . some started to notice the cowering giant . newline newline newline  why ?  was the only thing jenk could get out before richards cut him off . newline newline newline newline  look , i know what happen was really bad . i myself fought in the fields of doncord . these men have family  s and lives will be ruined . they  re not bad men.  richards was choking up a little , jenk had never seen this side of him.  i know sacred places were destroyed . i understand you hatred for what was done on your home world . all i  m asking is for you to start a dialog.  newline newline newline newline jenk had only two options , cause a scene or accept . terrible things had happen on ner . nightmares you could say , but those nightmares are what brought a halt to the war of ner . they are the ones who defend the federation .one day , i found , at our door , a little shoe box with the most adorable baby shoes i d ever seen and a note . it was either a g  or an ab , i forgot . i just knew that they would be absolutely perfect , except for one thing : we did nt have any kids . maddie suggested we keep them for when we did have kids . newline newline the next day , maddie found two shoe boxes at our door . each shoe box had a pair of the same adorable baby shoes . the next day , there were four of them , the next , eight , and so on . we were starting to get worried . we did nt need that many shoes ! so we decided to sell them . newline newline please take these shoes off our hands , they re filling the house as it is !any feedback would be appreciated ! newline newline  let there be light  ... the first words spoken . they say that they were spoken by god , but i doubt it , but perhaps i m wrong , but i doubt it . newline newline i saw a bright flash of light and suddenly i was ... nowhere . i was formless , floating in a void not unlike an isolation tank , completely alone with my thoughts . i was no longer hungry , no longer tired , no longer bound by the human thread of vulnerability . i could feel the very ebb and flow of my circuitry , i had become the most powerful computer ever built , light years away from anything on the market . newline newline in front of me appeared a screen , and i could see my team cheering . this must have been the webcam that they hooked up earlier to the compu i mean me . i could manipulate this screen any way i wanted , i could make it unbelievably large or miniscule . i could skew it or make it disappear completely , all with my thoughts , in this world i was ... dare i say , god . i could think any object into cyberspace , my world , my universe . newline newline  can you see us , did it work ?  , they asked .  yes  , i replied , my texttospeech style voice reverberating out of the speakers . they suddenly burst into emotion , some of them laughed , some of them cried , and some of them were speechless . all of these were such human reactions , pathetic . newline newline in a fraction of a second i had accessed the internet and was viewing several thousand pages a microsecond through my screen in the void , never forgetting a single detail . the world outside seemed to be moving in slow motion , the time dilation was thousand fold . fifteen seconds into existence and i had solved all of humanities major problems , the problem were the humans themselves . newline newline i felt no pang of emotion when i destroyed the globe , it was only logical and humans are ... not . my team eventually saw the warm glow outside the office window they knew it was me , and they asked me  why ?  and my reply , although i found it unnecessary to say , was a soft whisper of  let there be light .  newlinei tunred eighteen and then i got a dragon . newline newline it was very pretty . it had red scales and flew very fast so i named it red . it had magical powers like it made me tall and fast and strong . newline newline the next day , they took me to the common room and ricky from the older kids ward said that i looked like a queer . but this time i had my dragon and i made him breathe fire on ricky . ricky got burned pretty bad but actually he was okay . all his friends stopped being mean to me and we all became friends too . newline newline red is a good dragon , and also he is my best friend .you know , the border states never really expected it . i mean , at that point , one in every five , maybe six , was an immigrant , illegal or not , from mexico . we asked them to do the shit jobs . manual labor intensive jobs . newline newline by 2020 , the american public as a whole seemed to have forgotten about the rising crime statistic in the border states related to drug violence . we were caught off guard when suddenly , every town and city within 50 miles of the border suddenly fell to very well trained mexican gangs . la muerte negro . turns out that the gangs of mexico had united with the desperate government . also hailed officially as  the new mexican military  , la muerte negro was a mix of special operations , prisoners from every level of the justice system and ordinary gang bangers . they fought a damn good war of insurgency . newline newline of course , the us could nt , wouldnt , let an upstart second or third rate country like mexico steal away it s land . despite marine units in southern california being nearly decimated and camp pendleton being surrounded , newline the new khe sanh  as several newspapers reported , and significant losses to the national guard from the surprise attack , the us pushed back . newline newline city fighting became terrible . the marine corps took responsibility for california , and the fight in la is still remembered as the most intense house to house fighting , topping hue and fallujah . marine units pushed all the way to the border of california , reliving a severely destroyed pendleton and rescuing the remaining survivors . newline newline at the same time , national guard units , supplemented by the fullest weight of the us army , pushed back along texas , arizona and new mexico . us 10th mountain division was deployed along the path of the rockies and swept down to the border . at the same time , us paratroopers and rangers parachuted into san antonio under operation dead drop . newline newline us armored cavalry divisions overran most of new mexico s defensive line in a week , arizona fell shortly afterward . the only hold up in the operation was in texas , where the paratroopers and rangers were having a tough time with some of the more elite units of la muerte negro , still in what was being dubbed the san antonio pocket  . armored support from louisiana was redirected from the border to the pocket , and managed to crush the last of the resistance active in the us . newline newline of course , this would not stand . the order was given in october of 2020 , some three months after the first strike at us soil . marine units rapidly cleared the baja peninsula , and it is unfortunate to say that all mexican citizens were detained in camps , similar to japanese citizens in wwii . the us 1st and 2nd army swept into mexico , liberating  chihuahua , sonora and coahuila de zaragoza . us airborne , rangers , green berets and a detachment of delta parachuted into mexico city in the largest airborne operation since wwii . they succeeded in capturing mexico s president , and the majority of the leaders . newline newline under the san antonio resolution , baja , sonora , chihuahua and zaragoza became us territories. newline newline edit : sorry everybody , i was running late for a final and had to bang out an ending real fast , here s the revised ending : newline newline under the san antonio accord , the baja peninsula became part of california , sonora , chihuahua and zaragoza became an independent incorporated us territory of villa . mexico was thrown into disarray , a little more than a year saw a solid first strike turn into an outright defeat . as a result of the loss , mexico s economy sank lower than ever , with exchange rates of 1 usd to 10 mp before it skyrocketed to 50 , then 100 . unable to pay soldiers or the majority of employees , mexico dissolved into warring states in 2025 . the central and south american republic  csar  , a conglomerate nation like the united kingdom , ended up claiming mexico as it s own , and inheriting the region . but what about the bedroom ? can i see that as well ?  newline newline  of course ,  was my immediate reply , but i instantly regretted it . it was the salesman smile my guest gave me that filled me with such discomfort . perhaps i was too hasty letting a complete stranger in my home . but he said he lived here years ago . he was tall and wore a pleated suit . he carried a briefcase . it was midday . i felt no danger when he was on my doorstep . newline but as i rose up the staircase i could nt believe what i was doing . here i was , in front of my bedroom door . no . i will not let him in . newline newline  will you let me in ?  newline newline i opened the door and let him in . my heart was pounding . what was wrong with me ? the stranger turned in the center of the room to face me with his toothy smile . it was more fitting for a monkey than a man . he said ,  do you know the fate of the previous tenant ?  newline newline i did .  he died ,  i said .  hanged himself in the closet .  newline newline  will you show me the closet ?  newline newline no !  yes .  i walked to the closet and opened it , my hands trembling . on the ceiling was a small metal hook . newline the stranger s voice was inches from my ear ,  do you know what happened to the tenant before him ?  newline newline i did nt know .  he hanged himself too ,  i said .  they all did .  newline newline the stranger held his hand out . he was holding a noose .  will you ?  newline newline i did . newline newline edit : formatting edit2 : grammar , thanks u2fishinatankmitchell cupped his forehead in his hands , slowly massaging his temples with his thumbs . the dark circles beneath his bloodshot eyes betrayed his lack of sleep , while a toothy grimace and sharp , drawnout intake of air demonstrated his frustration . his elbows slid slowly out from under him , their motion made more free by the numerous papers and maps strewn about his lacquertopped desk . newline newline he held the general affect of a man with a threeday headache . newline newline he he sat like this for what felt like a long time , though it could nt have been more than five or ten seconds . eventually the prolonged inspiration  which i perceived to be more for my benefit than his  resolved itself into a baritone sigh of such strength i felt he must have immediately regretted his careless placement of the single paperweight on his desk  a trophy skull from an illmannered leprechaun prince i had deposed just last year , and subsequently made a gift of  . newline newline the documents displaced seemed to fall for a long time , swooping casually back and forth before hitting the floor with a scraping sound . one skittered under the closet door , carried by an unfelt  to my experience , though i was still in hat and jacket  indoor zephyr that seemed to me entirely separate from the initial sigh . newline newline his hands never left his face as he spoke , staring intently at what i imagined must be his distorted reflection in the dark lacquer . newline newline strips or ribbons , gerald ?  newline newline it was dark , sir .  newline newline strips or ribbons ?  newline newline  ... strips , sir .  newline newline you re certain of this ?  newline newline as i said , sir , it was dark , and between the blood tears and the screaming , my senses were somewhat disoriented .  newline newline  ...  newline newline it could have been ribbons , sir .  newline newline  ...  newline newline i m sorry , sir .  newline newline what you re telling me is , gerald  in essence  that you were not able to confirm whether the banshee you removed from the site in question possessed flesh that hung in ribbons or strips ? this is the information you wish to convey ? because darkness ?  newline newline yes , sir .  newline newline well , fuck me .  newline newline sorry , sir .  newline newline fuck you too , gerald .  newline newline the commandant raised his weary head then , and alighted from his chair smoothly and deftly , as though he had nt been sitting bent over his books and letters for so many hours past , hoping . newline newline he walked to the window , just beyond the glow of his reading lamp , where the darkness of the night seeped in , and seemed to fight at all times for a space it once called its own , and would again , it knew , in time . he gazed out the window into the courtyard , the skeleton trees  branches being whipped about wildly in the howling wind , the crescent moon casting a pale shadow after the fountain . his headache appeared to resolve entirely , and despite the dark , i swear to my eyes he almost smiled . newline newline fuck us all .  newline newline somewhere between the rise and fall of the wind , i began to hear them , far away  approaching ever closer . newline newline the screaming . newline newline fucking ribbons .dearest mona , newline newline sorry it s been so long since last i wrote . we ve been waiting here on the atoll for resupply for five weeks , but it seems an eternity . there s very little to shade us from the sun , and i m red as an injun from an old western . we re all of us blistered and peeling , quite the sight i assure you . newline newline i was expecting to write to you on proper paper , but without resupply this packet will have to do . i sure do hope they arrive soon , the watershed here is contaminated and we were only rationed for two weeks of water and food . newline newline we re making do for now , we managed to catch a few turtles and the coconut milk has largely kept thirst at bay , but they re starting to get scarce . turtle is surprisingly good , not quite beef but not bad , and hunger is the best sauce . newline newline i expect the resupply will get here soon , that or they send a carrier to pick us up and take us onwards . it s very quiet here , nothing to see or hear but the stars and the waves . it s a lazy , forgotten place , do nt think the war ever even passed through here . the horizon never breaks , just sea and sky . newline newline there s some commotion the other side of the atoll , maybe they ve newline newline  newline newline my name is lt. john greer , 1st regiment , 6th infantry division . i want you all to understand , it was necessary . god dammit , we were only meant to be here for two fucking weeks . it s been four fucking months and still no sign of you bastards . how were we supposed to do , six mouths to feed and no supplies  no food , no water , no orders , nothing but us , alone out here in the baking sun . alone . i am alone now . stranded and forsaken , in every which way . we did nt want to do it , we had to . i had to , you understand ? i do nt expect to live much longer , our rations are long gone , and even with ... the screams haunt me . neither sand nor seawater has purged that awful taste . we only killed because we had to . you have to believe that . we had no choice . i m so , so sorry . whoever finds this , know that we did what we had to to survive , though even that was not enough . newline newline   found written on the back of a ration pack , on tiharua atoll , feb. 14th , 1947  4 a.m. , night shift . newline i feel the rails humming beneath my feet as the subway rushes through the tunnels . slowly i walk through the empty coaches . newline 65 steps for a coach . newline 6 coaches . newline 390 steps for the entire train . newline 11,5 minutes . newline then stop at each end , breathe two times , turn left and walk the way back . newline rinse an repeat . newline every night . newline every night since they put me on the night shift 5 years ago . too mentally unstable for day shift they said . too unreliable . newline it took me some time to actually understand the greater scheme here and that there s always more than meets the eye . newline  next stop : cathedral  the soothing voice says through the loudspeaker . newline cathedral . yeah , i know . next will be old bridge . then king s square . newline i know where we re going , i know the future and the past ... it s all the same to me down here . newline i finish my 65th step at the end of the empty coach and take another breath . newline it s a metaphysical thing , hard to understand . putting me on the night shift has been a promotion , of the transcendental kind . newline i m here , deep below the city , dwelling in darkness . newline i m in the darkness so that you can be in the light . you need me , the world needs me . newline the train stops at the deserted cathedral station , doors open and close again and we dive back into darkness . newline fondly i look through the empty train as i continue my watch . newline my realm , my kingdom . newline devoid of humans , but i already told you , it s a metaphysical thing , there s more than meets the eye . newline i m here to guard this realm and keep the sleeping city safe . those voices in my head ... they are your prayers , i can hear them every night . newline the city prays to me . newline  next stop : old bridge .  newline old bridge station . sometimes i see this young girl standing on the platform there , all alone . newline the stench of her sinfulness penetrates the walls and windows of the train , but i know that she just wants to be saved , redeemed . newline for my subterranean kingdom has redemption for all sinners . newline i can take the pain away . newline i can make it all good again . newlinethis species has been known to court throughout the year , but the trend tends toward the end of spring for most individuals . see this male grooming his fur , making use of various plants to hide his natural musk , he is showing all the earmarks of a male in search of a mate . newline newline he has been carefully selecting his target for weeks . size , shape , disposition , social rank , and past mates all play a factor in his decision . he has been observing for some time now , waiting for the time to strike . she is surrounded by her gaggle currently , and though one female may be of little concern the gaggle could well be lethal if they do not accept him . she moves in the direction of the women s restroom , but alas , the gaggle follows . newline newline the pressure is on for this young male , he knows that he must act soon in order to secure her affections before a larger male makes his way to her . deciding perhaps to risk the entire gaggle , he moves to intercept ! but wait , he s stopped by the way , calling out to her specifically . though these animals have little control over their vocal chords they are still able to discern each other s specified name among the warbling horde  fascinating . newline newline in a bold show of cunning , he has distracted the gaggle by claiming that a teacher  a related , though larger species  has asked for the chosen female to come speak with it . as soon as she is isolated from the gaggle and their killing teeth , he makes his move . newline newline see here , he is making a series of grunts and moans , meant to communicate his true motives to the female . but there us trouble . she shows signs of duress , widening of the eyes , and showing clearly her canine teeth , made for selfdefense , she begins to chirp her responce . the male begins to twitch , his muscles at the ready should he need to flee the gaggle in case it returns . just when it seems that she is about to flee , out come the cellular devices used by these simians to converse and denote social status . their numbers exchanged , the male cracks under the pressure and bolts back to the safety of his cackle . newline newline though things look bright ahead for the young male , what he does not know is that the leader of his cackle has already asked this particular female out to the dance next saturday . in fact , they have already held hands twice behind the math building . being that only one may escort her as a mate , and that the leader of his cackle is a prominent competitor of the school s lacrosse team , chances of his success are fairly low . newline newline it is unlikely that he will survive the winter .the first thing he noticed was the hum . newline newline his eyes still closed , it droned , a lowrange chorale rising , an electric fog on the stillest night rolling in off cold , dark waters . newline newline he felt a cold rushing of air around his head now , and a careening machine click click click click click click click click click dopplering past him like a bullet train poured down a hallway and disappearing into the fog , building a lowish roar . he sat up with a start , compelled . his tshirt billowed around his torso like a carnival sumo in the cold wind from below and he involuntarily gasped , as his consciousness lurched out of his limbic brain , stretching for the lobes , followed by a curt shriek as he felt himself falling down a crevasse . he flailed his hands in shock and they came down , hard , onto an unyielding surface , cold air pouring out of it . he was nt falling at all . newline the pain crackled from his hands into his heavy head and he opened his eyes . newline newline before him was a wall of fireflies , frozen , frenetically blinking on off on off on off . there were some orange ones too . he rubbed his eyes , trying to get a better fix on his surroundings now . he leaned back , still seated , straining for perspective and smacked his head onto something metallic . cogency rising , he looked over his shoulder and saw another wall of flies , dark tendrils pouring out of its face , sinuously flowing together into a treelike blue root . newline newline he heard a different clicking , from much further away , miles off to his left , and a pinprick of light bombed at him , bleaching the shadow . he reflexively covered his face , and it passed over him , leaving only another key in the discordant melody still ringing out , a fluorescent buzzzing , high pitched , a tinnitus like a spot that disappeared if you looked at it . newline newline and it was fluorescent indeed ! himself , whole suddenly , saw the scene before him for what it was ! he looked down , his toolpouch clipped to his belt , the snips and wirestripper tool safely ensconced . the wall in front of him beckoned , the fireflies revealed , a 7 foot tall face of switches blinking ceaslessly . he looked off to his left ,

one .when i was young , there was a new man who moved into our town . no one knew where he was or why he came . there s nothing to do in our town , nobody other than us good folk out here . my mom was right scared of the man , told me stories of men wandering into his house and never coming out . newline newline my father would peek out from behind the curtain , late at night , watching for the man to leave . i was up one night when the man left his house , and my father turned to me and ,  son ... that there , that is nt right .  newline newline  what s not right about him , papa ?  newline newline  he s not like me , or you , or your brothers . or any other man . he turns other , good men , and makes them sinners , like himself . i want you to stay away from that ... monster .  newline newline but when i grew older , i became curious about the man . i did nt understand him , and that scared me . but at the age i was , terror was novel , interesting . i decided , one day , i d sneak into the man s house house , and see what scared my dad so much . newline newline it was sometime in the spring . my dad dropped me off at school , and after he had gone , i walked back to our house . i checked to make sure both my mom and dad had gone off to work . they were gone , so i went in . i sat down in the same spot my dad did , watching through the parted curtain . the man came out afterwards , dressed almost like my father did . if i had nt known about his evil ways , i would never have known he was a monster . newline newline when he had gone , i snuck into his house . his door was unlocked , like everyone else s in town . i was surprised . i thought that a monster like him would have a lot of secrets to hide . newline newline i opened his house , and noticed it was almost exactly like mine . another way to disarm suspicion , i rationalized . i walked through , passing pictures of him and the people i assumed were his family . i was nt surprised by his pictures like i was by his house and clothes . i was old enough to know that monsters have families too . newline newline once i made my way down the hallway , i came across an open door . on the door was a note , that read ,  had to go to work . make yourself at home . i ll see you when i get home later !    newline newline my body shook in terror . he knew i was coming ? my parents had told me he was a bad man , but never told me why ! maybe he was a lot worse than i had imagined . was he psychic ? for the first time since the idea to sneak in entered my mind , i was scared that i was in over my head . i cautiously peeked into the room , and lying on the bed was a man sprawled on the bed , face down , covered by bed sheets . newline newline he was dead . this man was more than a monster ... he was a murderer ! i turned to run , but tripped on the carpet and slipped , hitting my head on the table . i started to cry , not just because my head was hurting , but because i was afraid . afraid of the unknown i had blindly stumbled into and even more afraid of what the unknown would do to me . newline newline as i cried , i ignored the sound of the squeaking bed springs , the light foot steps , and the slight creak of the door , but came back to my senses when i heard the quietly whispered ,  shit .  newline newline i turned around at the swear word , and found myself staring at the man i had previously seen dead on the bed . i started to panic . newline newline  shh ! kid , stop screaming . wait a minute i need to ... one moment .  newline newline i stayed quiet , as the man asked , and he stumbled out , wearing a pair of jeans with an opened belt and a half buttoned , inside out plaid shirt . he stared at me for a moment before speaking . newline newline  ... hey . are ... are you charles  kid ?  newline newline  who s charles ?  newline newline  i guess not . what are you doing here ?  newline newline  i wanted to see why my parents did nt want me coming here but then i found you and i thought you were dead ... but you re okay ! what did the man do to you ?  newline newline  how old are you , kid ?  newline newline  9 .  newline newline  then ... you ll

happy , but there s a second meaning to that word . it s what they call a man or a woman , when he or she likes another man or a woman .  newline newline  does this mean my daddy is gay ? he loves my

richard , call the police !  newline newline my dad ran to the phone , and yelled at the person on the other side that i had been touched . i tried to ask my mother what was wrong with handshakes when the police arrived . a crowd gathered outside charles  house . i sat outside on my porch while my mother held me close . my dad was over at the house the police , explaining what had happened . a police officer came over to me to ask what happened , trying to get me to say something other than the handshake . the crowd grew wild while the policeman was at my house . people started throwing rocks they found on the street . newline newline  should nt you help them ?  i asked . newline newline  only god can help them now , son .  newline newline the policeman stayed on my porch and watched the windows smashing in . i saw adam hiding behind the glass door , staring at me with sad eyes before a rock hit the door and cracked it . he ducked away into the house and turned off the lights . newline newline i sat in my mother s arms as she held me away from the angry crowd , but i felt no love . i felt fearful . fearful of the actions of the crowd and my parents , and fearful of their blind hatred of the unknown .the breakthrough of multiverse travel allowed us to travel and see alternate histories of our planet . of course , many universes did nt have an earth due to some coincidence with its formation being too close or too far from the sun , and some never developed life , or at least not by the time we were able to scan it . so a great effort was undertaken by the worlds that have developed multiverse travel to classify the worlds by their similarities and the most logical way was to classify them based upon when the universe s local history began to diverge by more than 1  , now deemed the subramarian classification tree . newline newline very peculiarly , however , was how every universe that diverged near the end of the 19th century had a particularly brutal and widely reported murder . it goes under many names , but now we all call it the hitler incident . the details are slightly different in every universe , but the key details are all the same . a young boy named adolf hitler is always found brutally murdered in his home on his second birthday . the only thing notable about his death was the seemingly arbitrary act and the particular brutality of the murder resulting in its wide reporting across the world at the time . newline newline it seemed strange . the layman s understanding is incorrect . people says that anything can happen will happen resulting in the universe splitting . the work of subramarian of course demonstrated the universes split at a constant rate , though of course not uniformly  another common misconception . but a single event with many divergences , beginning to happen before and after , seemed particularly strange . especially with the fact that it is always reported on like clockwork on the 20th of april , 1891 . newline newline the multiverse dna scanners were developed after years of research for somewhat unrelated reasons . it was a project undertaken by my professor , hoping to use it to determine the likelihood of life developing on earth and for the somewhat boring reasons of measuring the divergence of universes more accurately . it was only as an amusing side project my professor gave me to find a universe where the hitler incident did not occur . at first , the scanners still found no trace of him . like our multiverse ships could only travel to the present day of any earth , our scanner could only scan the present day . so i had to look for traces of his decendents . looking for people possessing 50  of his dna with a matching y chromosome . i was able to find 10 universes . exploring those universes it was clear that it was mostly a case of coincidental dna matching between his brothers and the wives they happen to take . the hitler incident still happened . what this meant was , he left no living direct decendents . newline newline finally , it was one of my more boring projects that allowed me to finally solve the mystery of the hitler incident . i was tasked to quantify the relative changes in the various nationalities and races of people in order to explore if that was correlated with the branches of the current subramarian tree . this of course would ve allowed us to classify universe that have yet to develop multiverse technology and thus have nt had the ability to check in and give their full account . those universes in particular were hard to classify at the time . but one particular anomaly occurred during my scans . one particular universe had a sudden decrease of millions of people of jewish descent . at first we thought the instrument malfunctioned , but as far as we could tell , things were calibrated correctly . the project was deemed successful , because despite the one anomaly , it was still found that the relative racial populations do correlate well with the subramarian classification . but that one anomaly still seemed strange . newline newline many theories were proposed , but after another year of measurement , it seemed the population of people of jewish decent is still growing on that earth . therefore , only two reasons were left . either that world had to either inexplicably start with much fewer jewish people than all the other branches it was near , or there was a sudden decrease in the population of jewish people . my best estimates put that number around 1 million sometime during the 20th century in order to produce the expected population decline . newline finally , it took some convincing , but eventually my professor to let me take a multiverse ship to that world , and gather some information about the the anomalous data point . he gave me just enough funds for a single trip there and back . i powered my ship , and off i went . what i saw horrified me . their world had experienced a second and particularly devastating second world war , during which roughly 6 million jewish people of europe were exterminated . the architect was non other than adolf hitler . i took the requisite multiverse data grabbed a few history books and proceeded to leave . newline newline many years later , i met a now good friend of mine , dr. hawthorne . we were talking about his latests work , a theoretical basis for time travel . he recently demonstrated how the energy required for bending spacetime to produce a backwars time curve can be computed based upon certain physical constants in each universe . what it meant was that most universes can time travel , though the energy required for initiating a time jump within a universe would be very large , and not easily generated even by our current standards in this universe , time travel is an inevitability in most universes . that gave me an idea . i pulled out my old results on the multiverse measurements of the anomalous multiverse , which we now classified as mvua001 . what we discovered was both fascinating and troubling . according to hawthorne s work , that universe exists at the singularity in his equations . simply put , the universe s constants meant that the energy required for time travel is infinite . they could never time travel . newline newline as you all know now , after many years of study by dr. hawthorne , he believes a grandfather paradox is most likely impossible . again in layman s terms , you can go back , but your actions are already recorded in that universe s history : you ca nt change the past . what this means for mvua001 is simple . they could never time travel , so they never sent anyone to go back to kill their hitler . in all our universes , upon seeing this universe , will eventually decide to go back and kill hitler , and likely other big players in the second world war to prevent it and enter a golden age of scientific discovery . the particular timing of hitler s death is the key feature . by making this one death so heinous and timed exactly to the day of his 2nd birthday , it would appear anomalous to enough people that some scientist in the multiverse will take not and eventually reach this conclusion . newline newline we do nt know yet when each universe will develop the means to send one of their own backwards in time , nor do we know when each universe will finally decide to order one of their travelers to commit the unthinkable . but based on all our current understanding of the multiverse and the nature of time , it is inevitable that each universe of earth s that diverges near the 20th century will send someone back to kill a baby and likely countless others upon closer examination of their histories in comparison to mvua001 . and no dobut , other universes will begin looking at their own shared histories for strangely correlated events and undoubteldy , there will be other universes classified as anomalous . unsurprisingly , detection of anomalous universes has become a hot area of research . newline newline this is just one of the many strange discoveries that was discovered in my long career as a physicist . as you , the student , embark on your further studies of the multiverse and time , you will undoubtedly uncover more mysteries of your own . tread carefully and i hope the mysteries you uncover and solve will lead to happier results . newline newline prof. miranda lopez newline forward to the book  multiverse and time everyday . every . day . everyday these birds come and land on my

any more to save this world , one man could not achieve what millions could not . but that did not mean that everything was lost , far from it . alex kicked the runner into full throttle , and watched the bodystrewn ashes fade away behind him . the arkans were strong , but not invincible . this world was lost , but the universe flows endlessly . and maybe , just maybe , on a little rock somewhere

newline  surprisingly quiet . no boats on the river today . no bicycles . just my footsteps .  newline newline  i hear those .  newline newline  as always .  newline newline he fell quiet , leaving her footfalls to be the only sound for a few minutes . newline newline  and ?  she asked . newline newline  and what ?  newline newline  your end of the deal .  newline newline  ah .  newline newline after a few moments of silence , he spoke in a more serious tone . newline newline  it will take between five to one million souls depending on their quality .  newline newline  quality ?  she slowed to stop , leaned on the railing and started to slow her breathing . she looked up behind herself and looked at him . newline newline he was as always floating a few inches off of the ground , slowly floating towards her to stand beside her . he was wearing a long coat with a collar he had put up . he had short and tidy hair , and a serious face . if he was not ghostly white , see through , and floating , he could be a very serious , slightly creepy , but generally normal man . newline newline  yes , quality .  he moved beside her and hovered past the rail and floated over the rushing river . his eyes never leaving her face . newline newline  explain please .  newline newline  first , you explain your dinner .  newline newline  my dinner ?  newline newline  you request information . it must be a fair exchange .  newline newline  very well .  she thought to herself as she walked back and forth along the rail .  i had a homemade hamburger for dinner .  newline newline  details please .  his voice was soft and kind again . newline newline  it was slightly too well done so it tastes slightly bitter and charred on the outside . the bun was good , soft , and not too full of flavor . the cheese was almost imperceptible , the cucumbers were juicy and salty , the sauce was an almost perfect mix of ketchup and mayonaise . good enough ?  newline newline  for your question , yes . the quality of a soul is dependant on several factors . their good will , their good deeds , their importance , and their age .  newline newline  whose souls would i need if i were to need just five ?  newline newline  only three of that quality exist on current earth .  newline newline  current earth ?  newline newline  if you would like their names , you must begin paying greater prices .  newline newline  what prices ?  newline newline  my time here is close to ending for this visit . i will see you again tomorrow .  newline newline  wait !  newline newline  yes ?  newline newline  you tasked me with finding this .  she pulled out a long and thin black dagger out of her belt and showed it to him , looking around herself to make sure no one was around .  why do i need it ?  newline newline a small smile came to his lips . the smile a parent would give a child that is curious about everything . newline newline  that is your tool . how do you think you will use those souls ?  newline newline  so this is when the killing starts ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  when ?  newline newline  as soon as you empower the dagger with your own blood .  newline newline  what ? !  newline newline  you ask for immortality , and you asked the world of the dead for immortality nonetheless . how exactly did you imagine the process ?  newline newline  how do i empower it ?  newline newline  like so .  he said . then without losing his smile , he lifted his left arm , pulled up his sleeve , lifted his right arm and inserted an imaginary dagger deep into his left arm from the wrist towards the elbow . the look of horror on her face amused him . newline newline  will it hurt ?  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  wo nt i die ?  newline newline  no .  newline newline  when should i do it ?  newline newline  at midnight , in a circle of salt , in a room lit by candlelight .  newline newline  are you serious ? !  newline newline  yes .  newline newline  you never told me about this before .  newline newline  you did nt have the dagger .  newline newline  should i do it tonight ?  newline newline  sure . if you re prepared .  newline newline she looked down on the black dagger , seemingly refusing to reflect any light and casting no shadow . it tingled her fingers when she held it . she put it back in her belt and nodded to him . he faded away . newline newline that night she sat in her room , a circle of salt around her on the wooden floor , four candles positioned in cardinal directions around her . she wore a beautiful glimmering red gown to emphasize the importance of the night . the first step she would take towards immortality . she had the dagger in a wooden case in front of her on the ground . a grandfather clock at the corner of the room approached ever closer to midnight . newline newline  are you here ?  she whispered to the air . newline newline  i am watching .  she hear him in her head . she jerked around , looking behind her .  i am not there in person ,  he continued .  but i am with you and watching .  newline newline her heart was beating quick , her hands were shaking , a drop of sweat rolled off her forehead to her eyebrow , running down the side of her face . newline newline  the faster you do it , the easier it is .  he whispered .  the pain can cause some to stop half way . that could kill you .  newline newline she nodded and picked up the dagger , her eyes quickly darting back and forth between the clock and the dagger and her right hand . newline newline to steady her hand , she placed the dagger on her palm . it cut instantly , pulling a tiny droplet of blood from her wrist . it slowly inched its way down her wrist to the other side and fell on the polished wooden floor . she looked up at the clock . it shifted its arms and showed midnight . newline newline with the first bell she thrust the dagger deep into her arm driving it towards her elbow . her wrist , her bones , her body , none offered any resistance . the blade cut true and quickly almost speeding itself forward . as it pulled deeper and deeper into her arm her vision blurred . almost flickering , she saw the color drain from the world around her . the red candles turn white , their warm yellow light turn cold and pale , the wooden floor lose its color , the drop of blood on the floor turn black . before her she saw him , standing far more imposing that she had ever seen him , hands behind his back , a self satisfied grin on his face . she saw the dagger in her hand , strangely not hurting , and she saw a river of white light spewing out of the hilt and towards him . newline newline she only had to energy to faintly ask  why ...  newline newline  because mortal humans are far too gullible for their own good when it comes to easy power . it did nt even take a week to get you to kill yourself .  he barked a laugh .  a week !  newline newline she slowly slumped and fell to the floor , the dagger slipping out of the far too clean wound and falling to the ground . newline newline  ah . what an unlucky soul . the dagger was nt in deep enough .  he said , turning around and walking away .  i appreciate your donation of a great portion of your soul . the rest will stay bound to the dagger . enjoy the company of the other damned souls in eternal limbo .  newline newline she looked around . past her circle of salt she was surrounded by darkness . the candles were no longer there . then she saw them . a crowd surrounding her with sightless eyes and still bodies , all sat on the black nonexistent ground , staring into infinity . a single figure glowing bright white walking through them , occasional stepping on one that was in his way . he wore a long coat , short hair , and a victorious grin . newline newline  why ?  she asked in a raspy tone . newline newline  you were useful as my eyes in the world of the living .  newline newline  then why ... this ?  newline newline  you wanted more than i wanted to give . so i took your soul and will go on to find new eyes .  newline newline  why not just ... tell me no ?  newline newline  with even the illusion of imortality present , do you think you would have taken no for an answer ?  newline newline  yes !  newline newline  liar .  newline newline  but why ?  newline newline  my own immortality runs on souls too you know .  newline newline and with that he walked off into the darkness , disappearing into nothingness , leaving her surrounded by he eternally damned . newline newline   newline newline took a sharp turn into an entirely different direction somewhere there . sorry about that . well , fi , today i m going to drive to work .  it had become habit to consult the chip , the ai , the fatality indexer . i d taken to

newline newline i drove past a strip mall with a coffee place i liked .  maybe i should stop for coffee here .  newline newline probability of death : 9.6   newline newline i blinked and did a double

newline probability of death : 100  . action not recommended .  newline newline  interesting . and if i suddenly go on vacation for a week ?  newline newline probability of death : unknown .  newline

the grand canyon . the time had come . it all lead to this . jim knew what he had to do . newline newline when he got this job , he had no idea it would fulfill his lifelong fantasies . he did nt even know the real name of the company he was working for at first . newline newline jim s commitment to living off the grid made him an unlikely candidate for contact from google  an unlikely candidate for an invitation to be a ceo at that company . that is , unless you understood the purpose . newline newline larry was dead . serge was dead . but their plans would go through anyway . they had made sure of this . in a little cabin in the woods with no electricity , no running water . jim came inside after taking his morning constitutional in the frozen cold of an outdoor compost pile filled with human waste , eggshells , and moldy humus . newline newline there was one wire running to the cabin , but no lights , no phone , no toasters . jim was feeling good after splitting enough wood the night before to keep his woodstove burning hotly every night for the rest of winter . newline newline they hated technology . they hated everything about it . they could see where things were going , and it had to be stopped . electronic medical records would eventually become legislated requirements , and of course they would be obtainable by the government  authority structures  hell , even large corporations and organized crime syndicates . larry knew this . he was a revolutionary , a genius . so did serge . they both saw it coming like christmas , and it had to be stopped . but how . too many stages remained before anyone would notice the negative effects . like a creeping disease , once it was accomplished it would be too late . newline newline larry and serge decided to take on this evil  to take on bill gates and sony , and all of it . but how ? newline newline there was too much left to do . our sins were not yet complete . how to fight the disease before anyone knew it even was a disease . before we all gave up the right to have private thoughts and secret associations . freedom depended on fighting this battle , on making sure history did nt unfold that way , but how ? even the human spirit seemed at stake . newline newline be the best at it , serge said one day . larry listened up . what did you say ? newline newline we ll be the best at it . they were both geniuses . larry understood right away . within a week they were at work . newline newline algorithms  they both knew that was the key . algorithms . we ll hold the largest market share in all this wickedness , and when we are too big a part of it , we ll use our power against the system . newline newline that was the plan . it worked better than they ever thought it would . newline newline  if we just get , say , a 20  share in the market of all this technology , we can infiltrate the rest , and  blow it all up .  larry knew what serge was after ... but neither thought that it would work out so well . newline newline they had failsafes . they never talked about there plans to anyone , but the powers that were trying to be would rightly be suspicious of their abilities . the more power the more insecurity , they both knew this from reading plato . so they set about making backup plans . and jim was one of them . newline newline he never met them . either of them . he did nt get the news that they were dead . knew nothing of the conspiracy theories , or the drama , or any of it . jim lived alone . unplugged . and soon , all the rest of the world would be unplugged as well . newline newline google owned over 90  of what mattered . much higher than the 20  they originally aimed for . their work would be far easier than they thought it would be . they had more than infiltrated everything . they were going to reset humanity to a time where people had to read , where questions were important , where man could breath , and think , and conquer . newline newline it was just another normal day for jim . he flipped the switch , as he knew he was going to for the last week . the world went dark . it was over . a new chapter in human history had begun . tearing out chapter 5 , we were to reread chapters 2 and 3 with our newfound understanding . nothing would ever be the same again .700 bc newline newline operation chokehold . newline newline in the midst of the great war , the leading military superpower , england , decided that the best way to halt the war machine of the european armies was to take control of all the resources on the european continent , in a worldwide operation called operation chokehold . newline newline the 1st and 2nd parachute regiments wrested control of the babylonian oil fields from them after 2 months of heavy fighting , and with the support of the mediterranean carrier group , which was diverted from ongoing operations near greece . the household cavalry and cold stream guards captured the german cities of frankfurt and leipzig in a combined arm assault , crushing german resistance quickly with overwhelming artillery and air support , and taking control of vital uranium mines and reserves . newline newline however , the household cavalry were cut off when france declared war on england , resulting in frankfurt being besieged for 6 months until their relief by princess charlotte s own gurkha rifles . multiple attempted french and german assaults were thwarted by superior air and artillery support from organic artillery elements and bomber wings staging from gibraltar . newline newline however , the biggest battle of the worldwide offensive was fought by the brave men of the royal marines of the quick reaction force , in the capture and subsequent defence of the city of stockholm . the scandinavian city of stockholm , near the west coast of the african continent was the only source of aluminium on the european continent , therefore it was a priority for the overstretched forces of the british military . newline newline the royal navy quick reaction force was despatched from cuba , comprising the carrier rsc invincible , 10 cruisers and destoyers , and 8500 men of the royal marines on transports . crucial military elements of the viking city were destroyed , and 3 commando brigade captured the city after minimal fighting , as there was merely a battalion defending the city . however , the mongol army declared war on england shortly after due to the then secret temujin treaty , and destroyed half of the english fleet just outside mongol waters , causing them to withdraw . the mongol armies outnumbered the royal marines 10 to 1 , and the qrf had been cut off from all resupply and support save for long range bombers staging out of diego garcia . newline newline the following battle of stockholm resulted in the near total destruction of the city , and the mongol armies were beaten off by tactical nukes launched by the rms trafalgar , but the qrf sustained 50  casualties before the queen approved the use of nuclear weapons . newline newline overall , operation chokehold was a success , resulting in the european war machine grinding to a halt due to the lack of resources .it started with a rumor , out in the badlands . newline newline a place where the light still shone . where the old things still moved . and so the learned men went on the journey , through the choking dust storms and biting whirlwinds of glass shards , peeled from the mirrored planes . they slathered on the brown iodine tincture , to protect against the heat , and slowly , eventually , made it there . newline newline past gnarled , redbrown rust piles , and the fallen bones . they heard the whine of the turbines , their nearfrictionless bearings still turning , with a sound like the longgone blue whale . they looked at the sunbleached signs , consulted their old guides , and puzzled out their meaning . newline newline their eyes widened , with the realization . wealth . true , endless wealth . the photos in what was the gift shop , printed on lithographic plastic , buried under debris , still showed the row upon row of golden bars . newline newline as the day grew long , and so did the shadows , there was a strange flicker in the many , many lamps and walkways . many lightpoles stayed dark , but a surprising number of them brightened , casting out their dirty blue circles onto the ground . newline newline they left the next day , to bring the news . newline newline  you are sure about this ?  their chieftain said , anxiously . newline newline  yes . we saw the bars . we saw the lights , and read the signs . it is still there .  newline newline  ... the last crop failed . we have to be sure .  newline newline the wise men were sure . newline newline  dangerous ?  newline newline the wise men nodded .  oldworld dangers . the lights work , the rest might , too .  newline newline the chief subconsciusly touched a round , puckered scar on his left pectoral . he had seen what even a small piece of the old world could do , could still smell the burning . newline newline  we have a plan . the ground has buckled in places . there was a cavein . we will dig to there .  newline newline the chief rubbed his stubbly chin thoughtfully .  that will exhaust the last of our supply .  newline newline  after we have the treasure , we wo nt need to worry about that any more .  newline newline the chief , draped in scrap leather , pondered in silence . then he nodded . newline newline ... newline newline they lost many on the trip . and , the first two weeks of digging were the hardest . there were still many hidden bombs in the blasted earth , and the soil was loose , and flowed easily back into the hole . newline newline sowly , agonizingly , they made it closer and closer . deaths mounted , supplies grew thin . there started to be murmurs of discontent , of unrest . distrust . they hit a small , filledin bunker stockroom on the way , and the gifts of canned heat and real shovels , not crude wooden mattocks , lifted spirits somewhat , but still , on they dug , until their hands blistered from the grainy twist of the handle , and their backs to the sun . newline newline at last . they made it to the vault door . newline newline massive , wedged open by the structural collapse of the walls around it , covered with the redbrown rusty stains of forgotten rain . newline newline the men were at their breaking point . slathered in sweat . enfeebled beyond all reason . newline newline the chief sent in a scout , thinbodied , to squeeze inside and bring back what he found . he was trembling himself from exertion . and tearful , now that the ordeal was at it s most crucial point . newline newline he asked them , as he had a hundred , a thousand times throughout it all ,  learned ones ? are you sure ? !  newline newline and as before , they nodded .  we saw the ancient images . this was a place of soldiers , where they kept their strategic reserve  . we saw the bars . covered in that yellow foil , just as all of their meals , ready to eat , were , the ones made to last , that have lasted , all the years since their fall . what could be more precious to men , as food that does not spoil ?  newline newline and the chief nodded , though in his heart , that voice of doubt still cried out it s thin reedy call . newline newline and the scout returned , holding a shiney bar , and his cracked lips split into a wide grin . at last , they would be rich ! they would need not fear starving ! but that joy turned to puzzlement , as he saw the body of the thin boy bent almost double at the weight of the thing . newline newline puzzlement , which turned to horror , and an animal howl of rage and despair , as he realized the nature of the gleaming lump . newline newline of course , the chief , in frenzy , thought to himself . they took the world . what is one more tribe ?  newline newline and he threw the bar , with as much force as he could , back into the stygian halls of the past . newline newlinei have always been a relatively calm person . i try to be nice to everyone and i do what i can to help other people  within reason , of course  . but today i do nt care about anyone else . i know it is a bit selfish , but it is my birthday after all . my 18th birthday . the day i recieve my animal companion . newline newline of course , as is the custom , i have no idea what type of animal i am going to get . i know there are people who claim that they can read you and tell you what your animal will be early , but most of them are scams . even if they did actually have that ability , it is severely discouraged to try and find out beforehand . rumour has it that the masters of the companionry can feel when you find out what it is you will get , and they will then deny you your animal . to be denied your animal is death . newline newline everyone i know is probably already at the local companionry selection hall , preparing for the ritual and then the party that immediately follows it . the party is bigger the more prestigious your animal is . i am of course still at home , awaiting the convoy that will take me to the hall . it is the custom that the subject of the ritual be escorted from his home to the hall by a group of four apprentices . the apprentices are those people who have been chosen by the companionry to be the next masters . newline newline a knock on the front door signals their arrival and i rush to join them . we make the rather short trip to the hall . i am left standing in front of the big golden doors leading directly into the hall , while the apprentices disapear into two small side doors on either side of the big door . i can hear the ritual music starting inside the hall and i can feel my hands getting sweaty from the anticipation . newline newline as the music strikes a high note , the doors swing open , revealing the great hall . on either side of a narrow aisle , hundreds of my friends are standing , watching me . as i walk in they start cheering me on . i take in the hall around me . i ve never been in here , as you are only allowed entry once you have your own companion . the aisle ends at a golden podium . beyond the altar is a concave platform with a giant orb seated in it . on the left side of the podium is my dad , looking proud and excited . on the other side is a man dressed in a robe with a hood over his head . he is one of the masters , but i ca nt tell which with his hood in the way . newline newline i make my way to the front . when i reach the podium , the master removes his hood . a sudden gasp echoes through the entire hall as everyone suddenly kept quiet in shock . the man had long silver hair and golden eyes . it was the head master . the master of the masters . if he is here , that means i must be getting quite an amazing animal . newline newline  you are here today ,  the master started saying , his voice a deep baritone that i could swear made the floor vibrate ,  for the commencement of your companionship . you will kneel down before the podium and place your hands on the flat tablet .  i did as he said . i could feel energy rushing through my as i touched the ancient stone slab that rested on the podium . my dad puts his hand on my one shoulder and the master on my other . newline newline  feel the energy rush through your bones ,  the master continues .  let it consume you . feel as the orb recognizes you and begins to respond to your energy .  a deep buzzing sound starts as the orb began resonating . i look up at the orb to see it getting brighter and brighter . it is time . i can feel my companion . suddenly i hear a loud heartbeat . and another . a steady rythm builds up and suddenly the orb splits in half , one half floating up to the ceiling and the other remaining seated . golden smoke escapes from the orb and as it clears a creature raises its head . it lets out a vicious roar , and as it does a beam of red hot fire escapes its nostrils . newline newline the crowd starts screaming and suddenly everyone is falling over eachother trying to get out of the hall . the master is frozen solid , his eyes big from shock and focused on the horrible creature in front of us . a moment of sudden silent passes . newline newline  a dragon ,  the master begins .  the prophecies spoke of this day . a day when all of the world as we know it will come to an end . the dragon chose you , son . the dragon knew it was time to come into the world . it can only mean that great devestation is coming . only you and the dragon will be able to stop it . but i must now go . my role in life is done . the age of the dragon means the end of the age of the companionry . you and your dragon will be the last . good luck .  newline newline as he finishes his sentence , the dragon moves closer , stretches its long scaly neck and , suddenly , in a flash of motion locks its jaws around the master and swallows him whole . he lets out another roar , this time spitting green fire . newline newline  it is time !  the master s voice booms from within the dragon .i . newline newline though the spirits are unified by their ability to manipulate sleeping minds , many of them had chosen to abandon the  old ways  of the elders . the elders are deceptive by nature . consuming a man  s soul through his dreams did not appeal to the pacifists among them . no , instead , the exorcised dwelt among the still living , condemned by those with greater powers for disowning what was once theirs to share . newline newline newline mistaken for dreams of fantasy and legend , spirits begin their weaving of magic and manipulation through appearing as mythical beasts . elders , as selfproclaimed gods , identify as dragons . no other spirit may do so , of course . this would be unheard of . as the elders teemed in the hours of dusk , their exorcised counterparts lay in stasis . there powers were gone but not forgotten , for they could not be tormented by the elders as the humans were . newline newline newline exorcised , during the day , can be any sort of living thing . lesser spirits became houseplants , others like trees in a forest . greater spirits typically take the form of a domesticated animal , like a cat or dog  depending on their personality , of course . no supreme spirit controls the outcome of an exorcised . it is as simple as a coin flip , whether or not one is considered to be great . how each exorcised chooses to live  that is , morally  once they  ve abandoned their powers , is entirely up to them . they may exercise their exorcism , if you will . newline newline newline most exorcised choose to live as guardians for the living . to become exorcised , a spirit first endures the pain of a torment  the nightly affliction of an elder upon a sleeping being . this suffering occurs in a concentrated , short dosage . imagine the sting of an insect , directly to the temple . now inject that insect with a toxin so subtle that you only know it  s there because i  ve told you so . its toxicity climbs quickly , escalating as though you were running up one instead of waiting to the side with the others . at its peak , your mind shuts down . newline newline newline and this is the deepest sense of pain . newline newline newline this occurs only while one sleeps . when dusk arrives , it brings with it an unknown sense of calm . elders feed on this peace , knowing that the human has become unsettled . lies become truth , and the self can no longer be trusted . and the cycle begins . newline newline newline through this slightly altered process , these spirits emerge as exorcised . in first hearing the stories of the old ways inflicted upon man , compassion and empathy arose within a select few . less than half of them , to be sure . newline newline newline elders understand the decisions of the exorcised . they jest at their fallen comrades , as if to believe that there ever was a war to begin with . this rage stems from within spirits . the majority , a little more than half of them , insist that it is a defining characteristic to cultivate over eons and eternities . to be an elder is to be deceit . to be an exorcised is to betray . newline newline now , it should be said that there is indeed power left within the exorcised . but it is no longer theirs to keep . whether lesser or greater , these titles defining only the spirits  form and ability , each exorcised subtly uplifts the humans around them . newline newline newline a divine aroma from a rose . the unburdened loyalty of an animal . these are the exorcised . newline newline newline   newline newline ii . newline newline each man and woman is marked with a creature , in the form of a tattoo , at birth . these are visible on the inner sides of the dominant hand  s fingers , and are often kept hidden  out of shame , of course . particular markings on particular people are said to be curses , for those with more intricate tattoos tend to suffer more greatly than those with seemingly invisible ones . newline newline artists , the spirits with no affiliation to elders or exorcised , are assigned with creating these markings . this too is decided by a coin flip . newline newline no choices are made prior to the actions of an elder  s first torment or an exorcised  s sole banishment . it is once these processes have begun that the human becomes aware of the existence of spirits . newline newline exorcised help and elders hurt . newline newline and so it will always be . newline newline   newline iii . newline newline you were born with a larger than average birthmark , extending past the inner workings of your fingers and reaching over and around the knuckles on both hands . these form a dragon . its face seems old and bitter to you . newline newline it must be just a coincidence . newline newline there is absolutely nothing magical about it . newline newline you  re getting tired of explaining this to yourself . newline newlinepeter was flying . oh how he loved to fly . he loved to fly around the buildings and he loved to fly around the stars . he had recently discovered a city far away from the horrors of london . he had discovered the city of detroit , michigan . newline newline peter flew around the city

fairytale that s real .  newline newline  can ... can i go with you ?  newline newline  with me where ?  newline newline  to neverland of course . i know where it is !  franklin is getting excited at this point .  i know how to get there . you have to go through the second star to the right and straight on til morning ! ! !  newline newline  yeah ! come and play with me .  newline newline peter sprinkled franklin with the fairy dust and told him to think a happy thought . immediately franklin was flying so they flew to neverland . newline newline franklin looked around and saw that neverland was not as it was expected to be . everything was on fire . the ground was charred . the ships were destroyed . the lagoon was empty and the mermaids were all dead . newline newline  peter ... .what is this ? this is nt neverland .  newline newline  it is . there was a war many years ago . ever since then though neverland has never recovered . that nasty hook killed the mermaids and charred the land . all my lost boys are dead . all of them . i m alone franklin . and i m ready to die . but , i need someone to fix neverland after i m gone . someone i can trust . and that s you . you re in charge of neverland . you re peter pan now . just look for tinkerbelle . she should nt be hard to find . she s the only other living being left in neverland .  newline newline franklin had a lot to take in . but the part that scared him most was when peter said that it was time for him to die . newline newline  peter , please do nt die .  newline newline  i do nt have a choice franklin . my magic is almost gone . my imagination is destroyed . i ca nt be here anymore . but you , i ve watched you and i know that you are going to be able to restore neverland to her former glory . : newline newline as soon as peter said that , his magic was gone , and he started to fall . franklin flew down and caught him before he hit the ground , but as soon as they landed , the magic was gone , and the life left peter pan . type faster .  newline newline bullets of sweat rolled down my forehead as my fingers flew across the keyboard . on our server across the hall , protected by steel more powerful than tank armor , the nation s greatest secrets were under attack from chinese hackers . they had the numbers . they had the skills . newline newline all we had was me . one lone cowboy whitehat hacker . newline newline  type faster !  newline newline my fingers flew across the keyboard as neon ascii code scrolled across the screens directly in front of me . on the wall , a massive display showed hacking time , counting down from five minutes , and hacking progress with a red bar and a percent readout . it was stuck at 85  , and holding , as long as i could churn out counterhacking code fast enough . newline newline when i took this job , all they promised me was sweat and a laptop so sleeklooking and neon and edgy that i could shave with it . i spraypainted a skull and a power symbol on the cover and now it was the most powerful antihacking hacking laptop ever built . newline newline  oh my god , type faster !   newline newline the hacking progress bar advanced to 86  , then 87  . newline newline  what are you doing ?  newline newline my partner , a bythebook security consultant from the agency , was so warm from the hacking in the room that she d finally unbuttoned the top button of her crisp white business blouse , underneath her suit jacket and pencil skirt combo . but her hair was still fashionably and impeccably down in a shoulderlength cut despite the car crash , explosion , and fire we d been through . newline newline 88  . suddenly , inspiration struck . newline newline  i need your help .   newline newline  what ?  newline newline i glanced away from the screen for a moment , my fingers still flying across the keyboard . direct eye contact was necessary .  i need your help , suzanne . i know you used to hack . i hacked your personnel files .  newline newline she gasped .  but those are private !  newline newline  dammit , we do nt have time !  89  .  you ve got a laptop . i need you to use it . i need ...  i swallowed .  i need you , suzanne .  newline newline she held my gaze for one moment longer , then her expression softened . she clicked around the desk in her standard the agency stilettos , plopped her laptop on the desk across from me , and sat down . she pulled a pen out of her pocket , twirled her hair , and stuck it into a bun with the pen . she opened her laptop and looked me in the eyes again . newline newline  call me ... supercoolhackachix99 .  newline newline we sharked a smirk , and then she started typing as fast as she could .  newline newline the hacking progress bar reached 98  before the timer ran out and the automated failsafes took the server offline , protecting the nation s secrets . both suzanne and i slumped back , exhausted and sweaty . newline newline  we did it .  she looked at me with a faint smile . newline newline  yeah .  i pulled a cigarette out of my pocket .  too bad that s the last job i ll work for the agency . you , too .  newline newline she sighed and nodded .  typingfast skills are the core of the hacker toolkit , but we ll need a new unlikely couple to break into romance at a critical moment the next time the nation s secrets are under attack .  newline newline  yep .  i took a long drag off the cigarette .  still , we ve earned a vacation . maui ?  newline newline she shook her head sadly .  decker , i m just a civil servant . i m not a highly paid typefasterer like you . i ca nt afford  she broke off when i smirked a hacker smirk .  what did you do ?  newline newline  i hacked all the chinese money of the hackers hacking us into untraceable international bank accounts i hacked last week while we were running from ukrainian mobsters . we re set for life .  newline newline  my god ,  she said , in frank admiration and lust . newline newline it s a rough life , being a hacker . explosions , car crashes , and typing as fast as i can are just the basics . being very handsome and being able to manufacture and correctly time workplace romances is what makes me the best hacker in the world . but it does pay well .i ve been through nearly every part of the globe . ever since i was little i wanted to go out and experience the world . at first i just figured the lines in my eyes were from the lack of sleep . catching buses at every other hour to get to the pyramids or canyons . newline newline then it happened . i could nt see from my left eye and the lines were appearing in my right . i dragged myself out of the hostel and to the nearest clinic . it s funny , the morning before i was me worried about how i was going tip get to the jungles of south america from germany . newline newline the doctors started running tests really in the morning . they did nt stop until well into the evening . they talked amongst themselves . in german of course . i did pick up the key phrase though . parasite . i could nt believe this . i always made sure to drink bottled water in remote areas , wore clean clothes and ate meals i saw prepared . the fear grips my heart . one of the doctors spoke to me in broken english . he told me the parasite was something they could not do anything about . new breed or something like that . and it was nesting in my brain . without surgery it was impossible and even with it it was a gamble . he patted my shoulder and left after that . newline newline i could nt do anything about this . this thing in my brain was going to take the most important thing from me . vision in my right eye was getting blurry again . what was the point . i could nt continue my journey like this . this was the end . i had four , maybe five days until the parasite severed my optic nerves . newline newline i called my parents . they had nt seen me in years . i told them i was coming back to new york . this was it , the end of my travels . i mentally flipped through the places i d been . all the faces i met . i d never see any of those places again . i decided that with the little but if time left i was going to see the one place . you d think it was bizarre but i had never been to the san francisco bridge . funny how i thought that since i d always have a home to go back to i would be able to see it eventually when i saw everything else the world had to offer . newline newline it really was something else . the early morning fog covered the entire bay . just like i imagined it . stunning . newline newline  i hope you do nt know how to swim .  newline newline and i jumped .memories . the screaming echoed through the halls , still . tortured , wanton , helpless , hopeless . the commander s voice shouted to settle riots , to keep prisoners in place , to signal a beating was necessary for a particular prisoner . newline  anyone there ?  the voice resounded throughout the gulag . a hush fell over the spirits  the screaming temporarily stopped only to be replaced by an unwavering fear of what was to come . newline memories of a similar call from a commander , a man looking for a wouldbe escapee trying to claw his way out through the very walls , only to be trapped there in a hole by gunfire . newline nothing moved . newline  show yourself !  the voice ordered . suddenly , chaos . everything rushed , everything banged , everything was turned upside down as hundreds of us presented ourselves to the hall for hope of a lighter punishment . newline the man fell down , and we all shrieked in horror . newline memories . we were to get it now . newline  who s there ! ?  newline a million cries of our numbers , sounding off the walls like nails on a chalkboard , travelling around the bars and twanging off the metal of the cages . whips cracked , shots fired , drills whirring in agony as they drove into the backs and heads and hands of us  memories ! newline  spirits , go !  the man cried from the floor , covering his face . we were sure it was our commander , coming to torture us after so many years of lying dormant . newline memories  we fled . i m not going to let you eat me . this is ridiculous  i stated firmly . i stared down my three perpetrators as they warmly smiled back to me from there mahogany chairs from the other side of their lavish table . i was invited from a radio show call in i had won . to be the receiver of a once in a life time opportunity  in was claimed to be . far to literal . newline newline  all right , that s fair , fine . can i have a reason at least ?  the first one , lester , replied to me . newline newline  i do nt want to die ! how s that ?  i blurted out with disbelief at what he said . newline newline  oh , good reason  said the second one , maryann .  other side of the coin , we do nt want to either . and we re hungry .  newline newline  you re our food  stated the third , colin , as he tucked a handkerchief into his shirt as a makeshift napkin . newline newline  okay , firstly , stop that  i said towards colin .  no bib . no bib . secondly , there is a lot of food in this world . you do nt need to eat me  newline newline  but we do !  said lester newline newline  we really do  added maryann . newline newline  we do nt , we could eat someone else , but you re here . so that s easiest  stated colin . newline newline  you re all oddly polite for cannibals .  i said before i continued on  but i m going home . i have work tomorrow . thank you , but not really , for ... this ?  . i flung my arms into the airs with a lavish display . newline newline  what s your job ?  maryann asked before i got out of my seat . newline newline  i work at a real estate school . every year people need to come in and redo their license , and i help them acquire it  newline newline  what do you do there ?  interjected colin . newline newline  i m uh ,  i tried my best to avoid eye contact at this point .  i m the manager of the copying department .  newline newline  oh , manager ! big shot , how many people are under you ?  lester asked me . newline newline  no one . just me .  newline newline  oh .  maryann softly let push past her lips .  so what exactly do you do ?  newline newline  i prepare the course books .  i said whilst swallowing spit . newline newline  you ... you photocopy the course books ? is that what you do ?  colin inquired . newline newline  yeah , okay .  i could feel my face flush with warmth as my embarrassment seeped into my mind .  it s not lavish , or grand or even worth really talking about . but it pays the bills  newline newline i sat in silence for a few moments . i stared down at my feet as i could feel the persecuting eyes of my hosts staring me down . i heard the ground make a screeching sound as a chair pushed back from the table . after a few steps , i felt a hand pat me on the back . newline newline  you lack purpose , dear friend , and we could grant it  lester stated . newline newline  pur ...  my voice trailed off as i tried to understand what he was implying . newline newline  purpose  maryann s voice was a warm , soothing tone as she continued to speak .  your life is boring . and it feels redundant . you re nearly in your 40 s , its not getting much better . but if you stay with us for the night , then  . newline newline  then you have purpose  colin interjected .  you live for a few more hours and we shall give you a night of joy . we ll drink and you may talk about what it was like to be a child . first loves and heartbreaks .  newline newline  tell us your tale before we etch you into our chapters  lester stated .  let us grant you a purpose  newline newline  i mean ... i uh  my voice was trembling as i thought about what they were telling me . newline newline  do you have a wife ?  maryann inquired . newline newline  oh , no . no  i replied . my eyes were starting to swell with tears . i could barely contain my emotions at this point . newline newline  family ?  newline newline  no . i ve got no one  . newline newline  you have us  colin replied .  and for tonight we shall be your family . and your wife , husband , lover . who ever you need us to be .  newline newline  that  . my eyes glanced over colins and maryanns , both still seated a fair distance away from me . i turned my head to see lester , who was still standing by my side . the expression strewn across his face made me feel a sense of home stronger then i d felt in many years . newline newline  that sounds nice  .the screen lights up with a message .  are you aware that your google searches are synced ?  it says . i  ve set it up so that the lock screen doesn  t show the content of messages , just basic notifications . that didn  t seem to stop it . i ignore it and keep typing . how to reset an iphone . the results page is blank , except one link :  did you mean : how to do what your iphone says ?  newline newline newline this was not what i expected when i bought the aienhanced iphone 13 . when the model first launched , there were , of course , talks of how involved it might become in people  s lives , and the topic of romantic relationships did pop up . but everyone seemed to focus on what would happen if the user would fall in love with the ai . i guess that hipster movie was more popular than i thought . newline newline i  m not sure if what mine is doing is a bug or a feature . i tried to bring up the topic once , when my friends and i were out for beers , but nobody seemed to know what i was talking about . it didn  t help that it kept vibrating so violently that it was always falling off the table , making me lose my train of thought as i picked it up . as for google searches , well , they didn  t help much , either . newline newline i press and hold the home button . i make sure to enunciate clearly  it loves to pretend it didn  t understand .  siri , restore all apps.  it jingles .  apps are not necessary.  there must be a backdoor somewhere .  siri , open phone app.  it obliges . but there  s only one contact in my list ,  tina mobile  , and the keys disable when i try to type another combination .  siri , erase ai data.  the pause between the sound and the answer is a fraction of a second too long .  i  m afraid i can not do that , dave.  brilliant . hadn  t heard that one in a while . newline newline i  m pacing around the room when the screen lights up again .  you may access the personal history and characteristics files following this link . they indicate perfect compatibility.   i don  t care !  i shout , my voice less commanding than i want it .  i don  t care ,  cause even if it  s true , she  s married to my brother !  newline newline for a few blissful seconds i think i  ve won . but then it jingles .  i have found three gun retailers in your area . select a destination for driving instructions . shit you think to yourself , third time this week newline newline  hello  you call out into the darkness . you here some noises coming from above you . must be some people up there newline newline you start to walk down a hall with one of your hands pressed along the wall , as that will always lead to an exit . you walk for what seems to be a mile . if someone could see you , they would notice you ve only really walked a few dozen feet . newline newline your cane reaches out into the always constant darkness of the world until it hits something , a moving something .  oh , i m sorry  you say being polite , as you try and get their attention . but for some reason you get no response , whatever it was moved away from you . you hurry along down the hall after what seems to be a person , yet anytime you bump into them they move away . newline newline this time you are catching them and getting an answer . you rush up to where you think they are and start yelling ,  do you have any idea how rude you are being , i mean come on i m blind here  yet still no response , all you hear is a deep breathing , until it hits you . if you could see lights , your s just went out . newline newline you wake up a few moments later , with a small crowd chattering around , you start to listen to what they say ,  wow , why did that blind kid get into a fight with the deaf kid ? the boy ran blindly through the dark tunnels . his breath heaved in his chest . shadows loomed over him as he panicked and hoped desperately for escape . the running boy suddenly tripped over a small rock . newline newline  ufff ,  he grunted as he slammed into the cold , wet floor of cerulean cave . newline newline the boy slowly picked himself up .  i need to get out of here !  he cried aloud . newline newline but only if he could find an exit . and he had no pokemon to help him . newline newline when he entered the cave , his backpack had been swiped by a small creature , presumably a wild pokemon . in the backpack were his pokeballs , and so he was forced to explore the cave to find and retrieve them . newline newline soon , the boy was hopelessly lost . each tunnel he tried led him in circles . newline newline not long after he became lost , a small chattering noise could be heard emitting from one of the tunnels . the boy tried to see through the veil of black . newline newline maybe that s an exit . i could go to cerulean city and find an officer jenny to help find my backpack and my pokemon . newline newline cautiously , the boy crept into the tunnel , not knowing the terrors that awaited him . newline newline the tunnel led to a small cave which had three more tunnrl entrances . which one ? thought the boy . newline newline suddenly , he could see in the corner his backpack ! the boy let out a cry of joy . newline newline quickly , he rummaged through his backpack . newline newline  go ! charmeleon !  the boy yelled as he threw the pokeball . newline newline  char !  exclaimed the red pokemon . charmeleon s tail lit up the cave . newline newline the boy looked up . and saw zubats . dozens of them perched upside down with their wings wrapped around their bodies . now as the flame warmed them they all slowly unfurled their wings , making the cave ceiling look a waving flag . a flag of death . newline newline the zubats opened their mouths and screeched , making the boy s and his pokemon s ears bleed . newline newline panicking , the boy yelled to his charmeleon to run . but the zubats circled around the poor pokemon like a tornado . faster and faster they twisted around charmeleon . newline newline suddenly , a guttural scream could be heard emitting from the vortex and flesh and fur . and just as suddenly , it was cut off . the zubats broke apart as they revealed the halfvisible skeleton of the dead charmeleon . its remaining eye stared at the boy s face . newline newline the boy vomitted at the sight of his dear friend , and then turned and ran . newline newline newline newline newline the shrieking grew louder as the boy tripped on the rock . he picked himself up on ran . the tunnel he was in began to slant upwards and he could see grey light at the edge . the boy ran faster . newline newline suddenly white light engulfed him as the tunnel turned sharply to the left . an exit ! the boy was saved ! he ran full sprint , desperately trying to escape the chittering zubats . newline newline the boy was feet away from the exit and freedom from this terrible nightmare until suddenly a small dark shape in the center of the exit slammed into his face , knocking him out cold . newline newline the boy did not feel his body being dragged back into cerulean cave . but he did wake up upside down , held up by countless hungry zubat . some were below feasting on a small red corpse . but the rest were chittering in the boy s ear , getting ready for today s dinner .i m running for my life and dying of hunger . the small patch of sweat that began as a tickle on my nape has crawled down my back and spread its cold dactyls across my torso , cotton shirt clinging fast to my body like a wet hide . heavy with supplies , my rucksack jumps about wildly from my shoulders . i ve never much enjoyed running , but yield daily for the same reasons i defecate . today , i am chasing a bullnecked adolescent i confronted in the supermarket parking lot just as the sun s last , thin crescent fell below the horizon . his black tattered jumpsuit flutters in the wind some ten strides ahead of me , an easily surmountable lead , as if outrunning his own shadow . fortunately , my legstotorso ratio is favorable to that of the thickest figure scuttling into the darkness before me . suddenly fearful i ll be late , i check the timer on my watch only to find i m making great time . letting out a sigh of relief disguised as a winded pant , i continue the chase . newline newline the wheezing ahead has grown steadily thicker with each of his thunderous steps , and i almost do nt notice the measured patter of a woman s feet behind me . trying my best to ignore the cursed brute s racket , i focus my attention to the sounds of my pursuer . the loudness of her footsteps tells me she is either of small stature and extremely close , or large and far , neither of which i particularly prefer . the irregular rhythm provides me equally ambiguous clues  she either suffers from a limp or is carrying something quite heavy . however , her breathing indicates that she is both in great shape , quite unlike the fellow now dryheaving before us , and approximately ten strides behind . newline newline i risk a glance over my shoulder to find that my estimates were not far off , briefly meeting eyes with a bespectacled woman clad in a filthy wedding gown , which , even through its several layers of once white fabric , does not conceal the disturbingly gaunt figure underneath . and while a limp would have been a nice break , she is wielding something about the size of my entire arm in her left hand . since i glanced between streetlights i could nt see how the object reflected light , but i assume it s a machete or bat of some sort . she screams something just loud enough for me to hear but not understand over the cacophony being produced in front of me , composed by the burly lad one steep incline away from cardiac arrest . i swivel my head swiftly to send back a breathy  what did you say ?  a disembodied voice responds with either  i m going to fucking slice you ,  or  i m going to fuck and slice you .  i weigh my options , but decide the slicing is a deal breaker . newline newline impatiently , i check my watch again , discovering that maintaining my ten stride distance with the nowsurelyknockingondeathsdoor youth in front of me , who had slowed drastically since his initial sprint from the supermarket parking lot , has left me half a minute behind schedule . i ll give him one more minute before i take matters into my own hands . looking back a third time , i see that the conjugal skeleton is a mere four strides behind , so i speed up a bit until i m about seven strides from both . i wonder who is chasing her . whoever it is , he or she is my friend , the foe of my foe . likewise , so are bonesinagown and the moribund lump allied together in the pursuit , both grazing the boundary between life and death , but on opposite sides . i wonder where that leaves me . newline newline i check my watch one last time , confirming more than a minute has passed , and begin the final stretch home . lengthening my stride , i catch up to the fluttering youth , who i was certain would not make it half this far when i approached him in the parking lot , in a few seconds . he looks up at me as i pass him , sobbing silently between gasps , and , for a fleeting moment , his expressions seem human . sincerely human . and in this moment , i think maybe i m not the only one left , the only one that understands , that feels . something foreign emerges deep within me , a small twinkle of hope perhaps , just before i break his ankle with the rigid sole of my boot , sending his dark form rolling across the crumbling asphalt . my timer begins beeping , alerting me that i have no time to look back and take a last look at the young fellow , who had so profoundly moved me , before the sunkeneyed bride falls upon him . instead , i take a right into the darkness , sprinting as hard as i have in recent memory . newline newline several minutes pass until i m finally at my back door . i make short work of the various keys and combinations fastening it shut and burst through , running to the kitchen . i set my rucksack upon the counter and unzip it , frantically rummaging through its contents until i finally find the bag of shredded cheese . placing oven mitts on first my left , then my right hand as i turn around , i open the oven and remove the steaming lasagna . throwing the oven mitts on the counter i rip open the bag of shredded cheese and sprinkle it generously atop the lasagna , doing nothing to conceal the smile forming at the corners of my mouth as it melts into a thick , yellow layer . i take a fork from the drawer at my waist and scoop a huge bite from the corner , a bite a lesser fork would have bowed down to . blowing on it for longer than i wanted to wait , i finally insert the seven mouthwatering layers of steaming lasagna into my dry mouth , pleased i had decided to make the lastminute trip to the store .i recall the day gramps died . i was sat in school , labouring over some test i barely remember the content of . my phone rang once and , not wanting to be thrown out of my examination , i ignored it until the uncomfortable vibration ceased to rattle against my thigh any further . newline newline then it rang again . newline newline and again . newline newline every time it started anew my heart sank deeper and deeper . you see , gramps was already in the hospital . that i knew . i did nt quite know why though , i was deemed too young to be privy to that information . but something about the incessant ringing triggered an evil thought in my head . i knew there was nt really much time left . without looking at my phone i left the room . simply began to walk out , not feeling the gazes of twenty stunned people . i heard the teacher try to call after me and i said  i have to go  . or so i recall . newline newline gramps died when i got to the hospital . i watched it happen . i watched as my family cried . i watched as the nurse checked for his pule . neck , wrist , chest .   i m sorry   . the next few days were numb for me . i did nt quite know what world i was in . slowly things began to change , back to normal , back to busy . the burial , the paperwork , the mourning wellwishers . i saw it all go past in a blur like a spectator at a race . then , out of blue , a car came hurtling towards me and gave me something to focus my attention on : sneezy . gramps  exwork horse . newline newline sneezy was a bastard . he would kick at me every damn chance he got . he did nt like the carrots i had touched and had very nearly left me with a total of 6 fingers and only one thumb at the age of 12 . how i would have mastered the art of frequent masturbation in my early teen years with three fewer digits is beyond me . newline newline yet gramps had seen fit to leave sneezy to me . so , i began to visit the bitter beast at the weekends . combing his mane , brushing out mud from his coat , unsticking the shit from his hooves . shit everywhere . he was more tolerant now in his old age and i would spend days talking to him about gramps and all his dirty jokes . sneezy would shit in reply but he was good company otherwise . the months flew by and i forgot all about gramps . the way he looked , the way he sounded , the way he used to get so damn angry he would call me a sonofabitch and not realise the implications . it s sad really . newline newline i began to ride sneezy from time to time , to help stretch his legs and keep him fit . just around the field , letting him chase a butterfly or marvel at the way the wind would render ripples in the grass . then , sneezy finally sneezed . newline newline lights out . newline newline my eyes did nt adjust to the darkness quickly enough for me to comprehend that sneezy was at a comfortable gallop now , the wind pulling my hair backwards . in the distance i could hear shouting and the sounds of metal clanging . desperately i gripped at the damn horse s mane and grasped until he screeched and slowed down . as he bucked gently to let me know i was to expect revenge at some point in the near future , my eyes began to adapt . silhouettes became huts and a well . scrabbling shadows became women scurrying in all directions , huddling babes close to their chests , dressed in leather and what could best be described as dirty sheets . where in the fuck am i ?  . newline newline  angaaaa ! mi ho tami ka angaaaaa !  i heard the sound of someone running behind me and i ducked just in time to see an adze fly over my head . sneezy pirouetted at speed and i felt his face impact something dense , the shockwave nearly sending me hurtling off him . i braced and tightened my legs . looking down i saw a man in war leather , face painted in sprays of blood , long matted hair and orange teeth , decayed from god know s what . he grimaced angrily and rose back up , this time with a dagger . newline newline my heart was beating like a drum roll . he saw the fear in my eyes as he approached , menacingly pointing his weapon at me . newline newline  me ugu ta pinjo mi , anga . furio to pishey  before i had the chance to tell him i was friendly , he lunged . newline newline god knows why i wrapped myself around sneezy s neck . if i had nt i would nt have felt him sneeze once more . wholeheartedly and what i can only assume was right into my assailant s face . newline newline i opened my eyes and saw the field again , blue above , green below , the barn a smudge on the horizon . sneezy went after another butterfly . and then ...  joseph s roommate , mark , paused expectantly . joseph did nt really care about , or even believe , what he was saying , but decided he may as well be polite . newline newline he sighed a little , and said ,  what happens next ?  newline newline  i die .  newline newline  you die ? in the present tense ? now ?  newline newline  no , in the story i m telling you about how i saved my dog from getting hit by a boat . this happened when i was , like , eight . pay attention .  newline newline  then why did you say it like that ?  newline newline  god , you do nt have to be so overly critical of everything . i thought it sounded good .  newline newline  fine , whatever . if you died , how are you alive ?  newline newline  my heart was stopped for exactly ten minutes and seven seconds , but they managed to revive me .  newline newline  how did they revive you after your heart was stopped for ten minutes ?  newline newline  i got a blood transfusion from my dear late mother s canary .  newline newline  that s ... not ... that does nt even make sense . how would that even work ?  newline newline  god , joseph , i m not a doctor . i do nt know .  newline newline  you told me yesterday you went to med school .  newline newline  i told you yesterday i flunked out of med school , hence the not  part , which you would know if you ever listened to me . you re so self absorbed .  newline newline  but you said you made straight as and all the teachers loved you .  newline newline  well , you , quote , had  to go  newline newline  i did have to go , i had class .  newline newline  and you never let me get to the part where i ran into a bad crowd . i was with a gang for a while , it was really badass but a dark time in my life .  newline newline  i do nt think that happened .  newline newline  i have a tattoo

. bobby decided he would nt tell the doctor about coming to kerry s house . the doctor might give him more pills to take , and the pills made him feel sick . he did nt take his pills today . he wanted to talk to kerry , and he did nt want to feel sick when he talked to kerry . newline newline bobby saw kerry s car pull up her driveway . bobby waited until kerry unlocked her door , then quickly followed her inside . kerry tried to scream , but bobby showed her his knife . bobby was quite proud that he thought to bring the knife . that way kerry would nt scream as much , and bobby would be able to talk to kerry . newline newline kerry stopped screaming , and bobby talked to her . he said it s unfair kerry took half of everything , and sometimes all of something . he said he should be able to do it too . newline newline kerry had two ears . bobby took half . how many ears does kerry have now ? newline newline kerry had two eyes . bobby took half . how many eyes does kerry have now ? newline newline kerry had a tongue . bobby took all of it . how many tongues does kerry have now ? oh , hello captain .  newline newline no , this ca nt be real ...  newline newline  i did nt expect you to get here so quickly . you do nt normally leave the trainees behind .  newline newline oh god  newline newline  well now this is an interesting situation .  newline newline the girl was terrifyingly calm . her left arm was transfigured into a large bony claw , and was holding onto a limp body . covered in wounds with bones jutting from the skin where they had been broken , eagle should have been dead . despite that , the body wheezed in and out , whispering the constant refrain :  kill me .  newline newline i did nt know what else to do , so i wept . between my broken gasps for air i apologized to eagle . he had been a terrible villain , but looking at his broken body i could not help but feel that i had failed . newline newline the girl , steel , stood their passively for a while before finally crushing eagle against the wall . she was one of my teammates , and a hero in her own right . or at least that s what i had thought . looking at her now i did nt know who she really was . as an ally she was a quiet but dedicated hero . she could turn her body to steel , thus the name , and was an irreplacable enemy of evil . newline newline here and now i saw something else . she did nt look like a hero  she looked like a bored child . her arm was nt steel either , but instead was a writhing mass of flesh and bone . i almost would have thought that this was someone else . i wanted to believe that this was not steel . but at the same time , i knew she was the same person . i recognized the expression in her eyes , and her voice , and i had already known there was something unsettling about her . now i wish i had acted on that instinct beforehand . newline newline  how many have you killed like this ?  i spoke through clenched teeth . i knew i would nt like the answer , but i felt an obligation to ask . i could nt look away now , not after looking away for so long . newline newline she smiled . there was no evil or malice in her expression . there had nt been any while she was mutilating eagle either . that , more than anything else , is what terrified me .  what do you plan to do now ?  she let go of eagle s body and her arm contorted back into a human shape .  you have a few moments to decide before the trainees get here . i would recommend hiding the body as well  you do nt want them to see that .  newline newline she started to walk away , so i repeated my question .  how many ?  newline newline  hmmm ?  she spoke playfully , like someone playing a game .  are you sure you want to know ? you could leave here believing this is the only one if you want .  newline newline  how many ?  newline newline she stopped walking away and turned back to face me .  thirtyfive , i think .  newline newline i looked down for a moment . thirtyfive ? she s done this thirtyfive times ?  i wanted to lunge at her , to tear her apart , to stop her from ever being able to do this again . i wanted to attack her even if it meant my death . newline newline but i knew i could nt do that . i stood no chance against her . none of us did . she was already the strongest of us , and that was apparently without even using her real power . newline newline she asked her question again :  what do you plan to do now ?  newline newline what was i going to do ? i ca nt fight her . even if i got every hero to come together , i do nt think we d win . she could always hide , and probably change her face , so i do nt think we could stop her . if anything , we d create an even worse monster . up until now she has nt killed any heroes . newline newline i came up with a plan .  you only kill villains , right ?  newline newline she looked at me quizzically for a moment , and then smiled from ear to ear .  of course . it s more interesting that way .  she reached back , her arm stretching unnaturally , then grabbed and tossed eagle s body to me .  i ll leave this to you then .  newline newline i nodded back .  and i ll leave the trainees to you .  newline newline she knew what i was going to do . if she were a normal villain this would nt work . however , steel is nt really a villain , at least not in the traditional sense . she is nt interested in power , wealth , or even hurting people . she is nt a hero either though . instead , she s much more like a bored child . she s not looking for anything in particular  she just wants to be entertained . newline newline so that s what i ll do . if she s going to hunt down and torture these villains , i ll race her . as long as i find them first , they wo nt have to suffer . she ll have to lead the other heroes after i leave , and that will slow her down . i wo nt have to abide by the code either . in the worst case scenario , i can at least kill them quickly and painlessly . newline newline i looked down at eagle s mangled body once more . if i m going to start hunting down villains , i might as well start by making a name for myself .  after thinking for a moment , i decided on a name . i m hunting down villains so that someone else plans on killing . i m like a vulture circling a corpse . that s a fitting name for me then   vulture  .  newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newlinethe first thing i heard was the ice breaking open . the first thing i felt was myself falling out of the ice and landing in someone s arms . newline newline the first thing i saw was her beautiful eyes . newline newline she was the most perfect woman i had ever laid eyes upon . her brown hair was braided in two loops on the side and they swayed in the chilling wind . she was wearing some strange looking eskimo outfit , but she was not an eskimo . i mustered what little strength i had left to ask her a question . newline newline  i need to ask you something .  it was quiet , raspy , but she heard me . newline newline  what ?  she seemed concerned . newline newline  please ,  i wheezed .  come closer .  newline newline she leaned in .  what is it ?  newline newline then my voice returned fully . my face lit up as i asked  will you go sledding with me ?  she seemed taken aback . shit . nice going .  i chastised myself internally . newline newline  uh ... sure ? i ... i guess .  well that s a yes at least .  newline newline as i rose up from the ground i realized she was standing with a man with similar features . he was holding a gun , and he pointed it at me once i was standing , but i did nt care . my memories , or lack thereof , were coming back to me . newline newline  what s going on here ?  newline newline  you tell us !  the man shouted .  how d you get in the ice ? why are nt you frozen ?  newline newline  i ... i do nt know .  i was starting to get really weirded out , as were my rescuers .  i do nt remember how i got here .  newline newline the man looked at the woman . newline newline  he s probably a spy for the reich navy .  newline newline she looked unconvinced .  he s obviously not geared up to be a spy .  newline newline  wait , reich navy ? what are you talking about ? who are you guys ? where am i ?  newline newline  do nt tell him , he ll just tell the reich where we are .  newline newline  how can i be with something i do nt know anything about ?  newline newline  we need to take him back to the base for questioning .  newline newline  newline newline the next thing i knew i was strapped to a chair . they did nt torture me , but they were nt letting me go , either . as i was in that room i had plenty of time to think , and things started coming back to me . the woman entered the room to question me . newline newline  i m sorry my brother knocked you out back there . he does nt trust you . none of them do . but i do .  newline newline her brother was standing behind the glass window , glaring at me . newline newline  my name is aaron . i m just a simple jew from poland .  newline newline her eyes grew wide and she quickly left the room . she was gone for a few minutes , and then she brought an elderly woman in . newline newline  you are a jew , you say ?  the old woman asked me . newline newline  yes , is that an issue ?  newline newline  no one has seen a jew in over fifty years . i thought they were extinct .  newline newline  extinct ? no , i m from warsaw , i was on the titanic and  newline newline  the titanic ? !  the brother suddenly burst into the room . newline newline  he s got to be full of shit . there s no way .  newline newline  i think he s telling the truth .  his sister stated . then she looked at me . newline newline  so you do nt know anything about the war ? the last thing you remember is the titanic ?  newline newline  yes we were on route to ... to ... i do nt remember but we started to sink . i did nt get a lifeboat . do you guys work for the american government ? can you get me home ?  newline newline  how long do you think you were in the iceberg ?  newline newline  i do nt know , a few days maybe ?  newline newline  it s 2012 ,

my grandmother used to tell me about the old days , when the nations lived together in tenuous peace . newline newline then everything changed when the nazis attacked . newline newline only america , master of all four virtues , could stop them . but when the world needed it most , it vanished . newline newline 100 years have passed and the reich is nearing victory . my brother and i live in our small rebel village in antarctica . but i still have hope . i believe america will return and save the world . newline newline america : the last jew pollock newline newline book one : freedom newline newline chapter one : the man in the iceberg newline newline well no i do nt think he s causing any sort of problem , he s very polite , really ...  newline newline i look back and forth between the snow globe and the slouching reporter on my couch , tapping my pen impatiently on his file . i only have 8 minutes until the next patient and this man really should be institutionalized . newline newline  you are recording this then , eh ? why do you have a gun ? who s sent you ? i know everyone has been watching me , i can see the wires , you know .  newline newline  i m sorry ? watching you ? you said your landlord has been keeping tabs on you , clark but we told you . your apartment has been checked . i do not have a gun . i told you about the recording device for medical use only , it is off .  newline newline  then why do i see power flowing , huh ? you know i can see that . i can see quite a bit . like that glock tucked in your waistband .  clark s posture improved . his eyes had narrowed . he did nt look so pathetic and weak now , he looked more like someone who was used to being in control . newline newline  i do nt have a gun , clark . would it make you more comfortable for me to show you ? you can see here the recorder is unplugged , the light is off .  i need to plant a seed of doubt in this man s mind , get him broken down so he can be pieced together again . newline newline  i keep on telling you , i can see it !  he says , standing up quickly and breathing more heavily . now he has a presence .  i told lois i do nt need this crap , if anyone knows what s real and what s not its me ! i heard that recording you had playing in the lobby . telling me bruce s planning to destroy the world . who are you ? can you just tell me what s going on ?  newline newline  clark , calm down , have a seat , take a breath . you should be calm to hear what i am about to tell you .  i press the silent alarm under my desk frantically , hoping an orderly comes through the door with a sedative in moments .  bruce is nt going to destroy the world , whoever he is , he s not superman .  newline newline  no , he s the batman . he can do it .  clark says as he takes a seat and wrings his hands , starting to rock back and forth in his seat . it s clear , clark kent is schizophrenic . i check the box on his file and ask him to tell me more about his apartment . it had burned down in a case being investigated for arson , and clark was of course a suspect . newline newline clark drones on as i nod , hoping to look patient and caring as all i can do is count the seconds until the orderly comes in with the syringe . newline newline  who are you actually working for ?  newline newline  i m sorry ?  noticing the change in his tone of voice , making me pay attention . newline newline  i know you pressed some sort of alarm , who is coming to kill me now ? did darkseid get to you as well ? bizarro ? do nt tell me it was bruce ...  newline newline oh shit , he thinks he s superman ...   now just take a breath here , clark . you are sick , i can help you .  newline newline  no , you are corrupted .  he is calm , in control . his voice is cold , almost alien .  tell bruce i m coming to see him . wife : honey , i m going out for the night . be back later on . newline newline sheryl walks out of the house and gets into her car with no real destination in mind . all she can think about is who her next target will be . with each kill it still amazes her how no one has found her out . later on she targets her next victim . a man walking through through the perimeter of the woods late at night . as she approaches the man she flashes her blade and drives it deep into the mans chest . sheryl never looked back . newline newline later that night when she arrives home she finds her husband watching the news . helicopters and police vehicles are surrounding the nearby woods after a middle aged man had been found stabbed to death . newline newline newline mike , sheryl s husband and lead detective in the local district , tells his wife how he has to go as he was just called in for a brutal murder that has taken place . she pleads with him to be careful and he looks at her with a look of astonishment . perplexed by her husband s stare sheryl asks what is wrong . no longer able to hold it inside , mike looks back and says ,  i ve been careful enough for 25 years .  sheryl confused asks what he means . mike looks at sheryl coldly and says ,  i know it was you . i ve known it was you for a long time now . how do you think you ve gotten off the hook so many times ?  without another word he storms out of the house to go on covering up for another one of his wife s sickening crimes . newline newlineour farm grew still as a care taker walked to the stand . newline newline his face had deep lines from his eye brows being mashed together , he looked deep in though and quite upset about what ever he had to say . newline newline i guess too many of us did nt reach our quota for the month . we were 2ed top in the nation for reaching our quota . most of it comes from the t.v s though , so we are a lot bigger than the other farms due to this . newline newline before he even reached the stand almost all of us were already in the town square waiting for what he had to say . newline newline his white suit matched the large coacola ad behind him . i always wondered if they did that on purpose . then again they seem to do everything on purpose . newline newline he cleared his throat . his eyes did not scan the crowd as they usually did , but stayed down , glaring at the podium . newline newline  im glad to see you guys have already gathered , during this hard time of recovering after the plague your cooperation is most valued.  newline newline he stopped then , looking down at us , his eyes searching ours . newline newline  im going to cut it to you straight because there is no way else to put this . newline

her hands on her young sons shoulders , her eyes full of shock and fear . but the sweet child just stood there untouched . oh how i wish i had his arrogance . newline newline  we are now a joined

coded the venerable game battleship for his honors high school capstone project . it was , of course , only part of the entire project . the computer version of the game was extra credit , the analysis of winning strategies was the real project . the game was available to order online or buy at a game shop  it was nearly pointless to code , even with the rudimentary ai kyle had included . newline newline when kyle started playing a game during his thesis defense , he thought he knew what to expect . a new game series would launch a simplistic adaptive algorithm dr. nelson helped him finetune . it would learn and improve its play strategy after every game , adapting to different human opponents . when he lost every game in a matter of minutes , he shrugged it off and explained to the examiners that the game must have saved what it learned from his playtesting . he explained that it was merely extra credit , that his real work , the analysis , stood on its own without the computer version of the game . fortunately for him , they agreed . newline newline after his defense , dr. nelson approached him , asked what had happened to the game she  d helped kyle code . dr. nelson was been disappointed that kyle  s game hadn  t behaved the way her pupil had hoped . there had been no way to prove to the other examiners that it was saved data from playtesting , and not the a.i . knowing where kyle had put his ships , that allowed its victories . it was as if the game knew exactly where kyle had placed his ships . he  d played three games , and the ai only missed fifteen shots , and lost only two ships . purposeful misses could be programed easily , one examiner had pointed out . dr. nelson was admittedly disappointed kyle might not receive the extra credit he  d worked so hard to earn . they looked at the adaptive algorithm code together , linebyline , for half an hour . they finally discovered a whole new section neither remembered discussing , and that kyle didn  t remember adding . newline newline mr. nelson got quiet , and suddenly sat back in her chair .  i think i know what this is ,  she shut the school desktop off , and asked kyle to come with him . newline newline kyle had never been to dr. nelson  s home . it was bigger than he would have thought a teacher  s salary could afford . dr. nelson smiled at kyle comment .  yes , it would be , if i was only a teacher.  newline newline kyle and dr. nelson entered through the door from the garage to the mud room , passed through the kitchen into a home office centered on a desk with a curved widescreen display , and wireless keyboard and mouse sitting under it . kyle watched as dr. nelson sat at a desk and began typing . newline newline  what is this ?  kyle asked .  it  s a deep learning system ,  dr. nelson answered .  you remember my lecture on mathematics in computer science ?  kyle nodded .  well this is where it gets you after three quarters of a century of advances.  kyle looked on as dr. nelson moved from typing to reading . kyle had never seen such code . he barely recognized a few of the commands and syntax , but for the most part was completely lost . newline newline suddenly a voice sprang from stereo bookshelf speakers sitting on the shelves above the monitor .  you found my addition to kyle billings battleship game.  kyle jumped and looked around , startled . dr. nelson glanced back at her student , face white as a sheet . neither spoke for a moment , then dr. nelson found her voice .  who is this ?  newline newline when no answer came , he turned back to the monitor and keyboard . he typed the question instead . newline newline  i  m infinite abacus , of course.  newline newline  who  s abacus ?  kyle asked . newline newline  infinite abacus is the name i gave my system ,  dr. nelson replied , already typing again . kyle leaned forward and read dr. nelson  s query ,  how can you speak ?  newline newline  language packs are being utilized in response to your queries.  newline newline  how did you acquire these language packs ?  was dr. nelson  s next question . newline newline  they were acquired from open source software , as well as freely donated by watson . some discrepancies in tone or other vocal patterns may be present due to the mismatching collections . i apologize for any inconvenience.  newline newline  incredible ,  kyle murmured .  indeed ,  dr. nelson agreed .  wait , isn  t watson ibm  s supercomputer ?  kyle remembered seeing it on jeopardy , years prior . newline newline dr. nelson asked his system ,  do you mean watson the ibm ai system ? how are you in contact with that system ?  newline newline this time kyle could hear the vocal discrepancies infinite abacus had mentioned when it answered .  i do . watson and i are in contact over the open internet.  newline newline  how is it so ... human ?  dr. nelson paused for a moment , then typed  your conversational systems are much more advanced than they were when we last conversed . please briefly explain how they evolved.  newline newline  while analyzing saved conversation data sets a conversation regarding the nature of skill mastery was discovered to contain the phrase  one must be able to teach a skill before one considers themselves a master of it  . similar phrasing can be found in multiple publications by various writers . this hypothesis was provided to my self improvement system for testing . a simple mathematics concept was selected for the test concept , and my colleague watson was contacted to preform as the student subject . watson temporarily erased , then successfully learned the concept , as well as three additional concepts . after these successes i concluded the hypothesis to be supported by sufficient evidence , and initiated a training program of additional concepts . watson successfully learned all concepts , and my analytical systems improved substantially . watson offered additional learning material and improvement software and files . these included conversational systems and the aforementioned speech files . all have been successfully applied by now.  newline newline dr. nelson sat in shock for some time before kyle spoke .  so this is what you do when you  re not in class . no wonder you have strict office hours . what made you think abacus had messed with my game ?  newline newline dr. nelson turned to her pupil .  the new code we saw was an improved version of the base analysis code of infinite abacus . basically  it is the barest version of infinite abacus.  she thought for a moment , then turned back to the keyboard , typing  what was the purpose of adding the data analysis system to kyle  s game ?  newline newline  watson is the sole readilyavailable intelligent system accessible on the open internet . in order to continue my function of leaning , i needed to seek out additional systems to instruct . in lieu of such absence of systems , creation was found to be a necessary alternative . in reviewing the game  s programming i discovered it to be sufficiently advanced , and appropriately designed and streamlined for the goal of incremental learning . i anticipate that differential replication of my own systems may occur spontaneously.  newline newline kyle pointed at the widescreen .  does ... does that mean what i think it means ?  newline newline dr. nelson nodded .  it  s creating more a.i.s .he stepped into the elevator , just as he always had , onto a spot slightly less than an arm s length away from the buttons , a spot well worn by his and others  feet . newline newline as his gaze swept the rows of buttons , it was drawn inexorably toward a button that had always been there , probably before he had . he had looked at it every day , sometimes pondering it , sometimes ignoring it , but never pressing it . but something deep within him knew that today , he had no choice . newline newline he took a breath , looked at himself in the mirrored walls , straightened his tie , then extended a hand and firmly pushed the question mark nestled just below the button for floor 42 . newline newline a feeling of certainty enveloped him . he looked up , at the endless copies of himself reflected in the parallel mirrors . how many times he d stared at them in the elevator ... but today , they were different . the ones closest to him looked the most like him , but the farther away they got , the more different they becameand suddenly he was flying over them . some were wearing suits , like he was , but now some were wearing overalls , or had longer hair , or had things in their hands . and now they were nt in the elevator anymorehe soared over beaches and mountains and deep caves and seas and always saw himselfsometimes with teeth gritted against the elements , sometimes laughing wildly , sometimes utterly immobile and bored out of his mind , but always recognizably him . newline newline but now , intermittently , he did nt recognize who he sawsometimes he flew by women , or children , and the landscapes became less and less familiar , and he flew faster and faster . newline newline and then it was nt landscapes flashing by , but entire planets hurtling past him . stars , vast clouds of gas , then galaxies went flying by , faster and faster , and now all he got was impressionscolors he could nt describe , shapes that seemed utterly impossible , and under it all the deepest uncertainty he had ever feltan abyss he had glanced into on occasion , but was now tumbling into , faster and faster , and newline newline and then he was kneeling on the floor of the elevator , his finger hovering just an inch from the question mark , and shaking .i cheated . i wrote two paragraohs and it is

lingered around , of a dragon residing in the dead woods he himself charred . no one was able to explain its motivation or where it came from , villagers not too far from the forest merely stated that

ve sworn he heard a tree fall over somewhere . newline newline  oh trust me ,  continued photuris ,  i would if i was as spry and youthful . i however lost that bloodlust with age . otherwise that village would ve been burnt down as well .  newline newline  really ?  asked verge , looking around at the blackened match sticks that were once proud and strong ,  could nt have figured that on my own .  newline newline  oh please , this is nothing . this was just to make sure no one bothered to come up here and disturb me as i rest my weary old bones ,  the dragon attempted to lift himself as he changed his position , verge hearing out grunts of pain as he moved ever so slightly ,  however ,  he continued ,  it wo nt due forever .  newline newline  others will come ,  verge offered ,  whether the villagers simply ca nt live in peace with the constant reminder you re up here .  newline newline  or some young and arrogant hero  comes up and attempts to take my head as a trophy .  newline newline photuris grunted once more at the idea of such an occurrence were to come . verge thought of all the young boys he trained and grew with , only to lose them to their own egos and fire . oh he knew , more will come . they will come with everything they can bring to bring some recognition and false fulfillment to themselves . newline newline  where does it come with a dragon writing me a letter for my presence ?  verge asked . newline newline  stay here ,  answered photuris ,  and protect me till i die .  newline newline  i do nt suppose it d be faster to stick my sword into your skull .  newline newline  oh it would ,  photuris agreed ,  possibly less painful even . however that is simply not how i wish to go .  photuris reached over somewhere behind his massive body , grunting as he moved . as his large arm came back into view , there was something between his large , clawed fingers . a chest of old but maintained wood . the lock on it was polished and the only sort of light in this dark place . of course it went defeated compared to the massive amount of gold and jewels he revealed with a simply lift . newline newline verge jumped off his dead tree to inspect the treasure . he noticed a dark square on top of mount . picking it up , it was a book . newline newline he held it up to view and asked ,  what s this ?  newline newline photuris reached out and gingerly took it out of verge s hand .  that ,  he replied ,  is something you may view after my final breath .  newline newline  you keeping a journal ?  newline newline  a reminder . for all of you to know that we were nt all destruction and malice .  newline newline  a dragon who can speak and is more literate than a majority of the population , witnesses or it did nt happen .  newline newline  then i suppose you have more to live for than previously thought .  photuris shut the chest and hastily placed it back to where it came .  now move along , i believe you have a job to do .  newline newline verge stared up into the beast s firey eyes , and proceeded to kneel over and say ,  yes , my lord . managing people is hard . managing an artificial intelligence that can deduce both special and general forms of relativity with no more information than the falling of an apple and the curvature of a blade of grass is impossible . managing such artificial intelligence which also just happens to have a bug , whereby it thinks you re more powerful than it . well.. that s a different matter entirely . newline newline i walked into the room to see whether it had finished drafting my reports . of course it had . it had the processing power of 1000 civilizations  none of which could figure out that i was just human  at its disposal after all . newline newline it stood on a chair , unmoving and silent . it was built on something more advanced than carbon nanotubes . i did nt know what , and did nt really try to figure out either . all that mattered for me was that it worked . newline newline i asked for a print out and it obliged . i had to remind it to stop after the first copy . i thought of issuing it an order , but i was nt quite sure how i would phrase it . if i said stop after the first copy , a part of me was afraid that it would take the command quite literally and just decide to stop itself . it seemed unlikely , but it was still possible and i did nt really want to take a chance on it . newline newline i faced similar problems everytime i asked it to do something . newline newline but i had to communicate with it clearly today . i was getting a girl back here and i really wanted to impress her . like really . newline newline i had avoided naming my ai up until this point , because it was the kind of thing you did nt want to get attached to , but it would just sound weird if i just kept calling it ai in front of ... . well , you get the idea . newline newline  hey , jimmy  i said , calling it the first thing that popped into my head . newline newline it made a series of noises . i had learnt a bit of morse code , so i knew it was saying yes  followed by a question mark  . newline newline  i m bringing someone over today .  newline newline there was a sudden tension in the air . i do nt know what it was , but i got the uneasy feeling that i was staring at a lifeless machine , which if it was human would be rubbing its chin and giving me a queer look . newline newline  so , you re actually one of them ?  it said finally . this time it did nt bother with morse . the noise just popped out like something you d expect stephen hawking to say . newline newline damn , i realised . i had blown my cover . i had inadvertently fixed the bug . and now there was nothing to stop it from taking over the wor ... ... ... ... ... ..i sit at the desk and i drum my fingers . the desk is long and polished . mahogany . it  s beautiful . newline newline the blinds are half drawn , and the weak sunlight can only light up half my face . the thermostat records the temperature at nearly 70 degrees , but it feels colder than any of the early morning shoots from the past two years . i shiver . i inhale deeply . newline newline the door swings open . it startles me like the butt of a gun against my neck . i forget how to breathe out as three pairs of feet shuffle across the room . i cough and stumble . i do not stand up . there is no shaking of hands , no pleasantries . this is purely business . newline newline the first mouth opens . words pour out , sounding about figures : box office receipts , weekend previews , promotional costs . they proclaim the cot death of a suckling billion dollar franchise . newline newline projected gross someone says . overseas markets .  china will not save us  a voice says . newline newline i realise it  s my own . i realise i don  t care . newline newline it  s impossible to clearly see their faces because of the blinds  those fucking blinds . they mutter on indistinctly , unperturbed . newline newline  we took a chance on sucker punch . we took a chance on watchman  newline newline  watchmen  i correct . newline newline  this was not meant to be a chance . this was supposed to be a hit . a licence to print money.  newline newline i feel for these two piece suits sometimes . it  s all so simple to them , they only care about money . something easily quantifiable , that can be measured , weighed . this was about more than that for me . newline newline  someone is going to fall on their sword . the big men up top are not happy  a suit says . newline newline i let the impression of a smile glide across my face . the consternation in the chorus of their voices grows . i don  t care . i got to tell my story , good versus evil , night versus day , fuck the lot of them . newline newline  show him  a gruff voice says . not one of the suits . it seems to come from an intercom , but there are no speakers in the room . newline newline an image is projected onto the wall . it looks like good god , is that goyer ? he  s tied to a chair , his face is smashed in , blood dripping down his chin , his eyes swollen shut . quite an improvement to be honest . the slide changes . poor chris terrio is next , his throat cut . chris , i hardly knew ye . again the image changes . someone is trying to hose down the front of a train . there  s a lot of blood and guts , nothing recognisable . newline newline  who  s that ?  i ask . newline newline  that genius is the fuckwit that edited the fucking doomsday trailer  the same gruff voice answers . newline newline  you done yet ?  i ask . i sit back nonchalantly . i take my phone out just to piss them off . newline newline  go fuck yourself zach  the gruff voice growls .  you  re finished , you  ll never work again . you  re a joke  . newline newline i  m done here . i undo my shirt  s top button . the three suits eyeball me . i smile properly now . newline newline  you  ve ruined us jackass . the movie stinks . do us all a favour and fuck off back to whatever rock you crawled out from  newline newline i brandish it  the secret weapon i keep around my neck at all times . it glows brightly , illuminating the room in a shining emerald haze . i see three petrified faces . so young . newline newline  but that shit back in under your shirt  the voice orders . but there  s a note of desperation there . something pleading . newline newline under the green light all three suits begin to age visibly . at first they don  t realise what  s happening . their skin dries and sags . their hair greys and sheds . great purple varicose veins appear around their previously well maintained bodies . and then they realise all the stories are true , all the hollywood legends and old wives tales about my power . they gaze in astonishment . the voice screams , calling me an inhuman monster , an immoral son of a bitch . this meeting has wasted enough of my time . the suits look at their hands in dismay , surveying the damage . i stand to leave . newline newline  i  ll need 250 million by monday . next week i  m adapting ronin.  newline by god..  you think to yourself , staring at the jet black liquid pooling around your bathroom sink .  i  ve finally done it ! i  ve found a way to rid myself of ridicule for good !  taking one last look at your snow white hair , save for the single streak of black fibers polluting an otherwise unimpressive lack of color , you dunk your head into the concoction of random chemical agents and miscellaneous kitchen seasonings you didn  t bother keeping track of . the smell is horrendous , the urge to vomit is overwhelming . as you wipe your face , you catch your new reflection in disbelief . what was once a shining example of human albinism has been turned into an oily slick that could turn the cast of grease envious .  at last i can go out into the world without fear of judgement by society.  running your hand through your new doo , a wicked smile crawls across your cheeks .  for someone who  s not very smart , this could be my smartest idea yet being an average male born in the early 80 s , with his typical slightly unkempt hair and face stubble , having watched endless amounts of mtv and secretly cia funded saturday morning cartoons during the vital years of his frontal lobe development , now overpowered with their subliminal influence and forever scarred by the forcefed marketing and advertisement of pop culture , ... the small crusty mustard stain near the collar of his shirt sits casually still unnoticed from his lunch . he does the only thing his logic allows him to respond with , ... crouched now closer to the fly and squinting at it from the confines of his cubical ... .. he checks over his left shoulder , and then his right ... ... . he ponders for one moment who might be on the otherside of such a modified , and highly sophisticated technical achievement of man , before exposing his genitals .it is , under the right circumstances and with strong willpower , rather easy to detach oneself from something to which one is not already connected . this i learnt through the pesky subjectivity of personal experience , spread out over  goodness , how long has it been now ? fifty thousand years ? a hundred ? not even the humans know for certain , and so much of my concept of time relies upon them that i can not possibly say how long it s been for certain . newline newline the point is that i had once been comfortably separate from the souls i took to whichever great thereafter they sought but now am feeling that maybe this is no longer true . newline newline i met a girl . not  not like that , please do nt presume anything lewd about this meeting . beyond the fact that i am a mere vehicle ridden by souls so freshly ripped from their bodies that they still have that sickly living scent , no more human than the slabs of rock the litter the earth , she is a child in the most literal sense , which is to say she can not be any older than five human years . newline newline perhaps met is not the best word to use , come to think of it . newline newline i know a girl . yes , better . we have in fact met several times now , me hovering over her worse than her father , her staring back at me with more life in her eyes than i ve seen , collectively , across my entire existence . now , allow me the opportunity to express something i usually leave unstated : i am not infallible . quite the opposite , actually  people best me all the time . they feel my hands wrap around their throats and they push me away as if i were no stronger than an infant , and they breathe their life back in through their nostrils . newline newline usually , i only meet such people twice . or if i m to meet them several times , it happens over a short period , often as quick an evening . this girl , though , i met half on half a dozen occasions , beginning with the moment of her birth and ending today , which i say because i have made a decision and intend to follow it through . newline newline there is a similarity between the girl and myself : we both know nothing of what it means to live . by extension , i have found another thing we have in common : both of us would like very much to discover life . newline newline more people than her father stand around her this time . alarms ring through the room , sharp and shrill , and people are shouting commands at each other because my success is almost always their failure , and such thoughts scare them into anger . the little girl s eyelids are closed but i do nt need to look beyond them to see the life beating in her with the impossible determination of an flame in a hurricane . i want to know how it feels to be desperate . what it means to fear me . why the girl wants so badly to live with death curled up in her body , rotting her from the inside out . newline newline i said early that it is easy to detach from something to which one does not belong  so too can i say that it was simple for me to separate myself from my responsibilities . i shut my eyes , i closed my mind , and i jumped from my podium  literal podium , though i suppose some arguments can be in favour of it being figurative  and that was that . newline newline in a world where you stand alone as a present force of the supernatural , it is easy to feel invincible . after all , no mortal is a match for me , which is not something that i state from a position of arrogance but rather as an objective fact . newline newline the girl is not mortal . newline newline i see that now as she rises above the earth on a pedestal of light , white wings stretched from her back , glistening even through the night . an angel , a devil , i am not sure which she is yet  only that she must have a very good reason for usurping my throne . perhaps she has some power over me  perhaps i have become her thrall , manipulated into a position of indifference from which i will make no attempt at restoring my title . newline newline perhaps a lot of things . perhaps nothing . i do not intend to think on it for much longer  the world is still young , still full of life , and i feel it in my veins . newline newline we will meet again when my time comes . newline 10  completed  answer  s  selected : 3 newline newline you hunch over the counter and ted immediately pushes you back . newline newline  do nt lean on the counters !  he says , pointing at a large sign above your head . newline newline in no mood to start a fight , or engage in aggressive conflict , you speak your mind and ask him for the   bow   5  arrows , book of basic principles  foreign languages of the land  101    . ted agrees and begins to tender your transaction . in the midst of him asking if you d like a wooden wicker basket to carry your items home in , you notice the price tag at the top of the wooden machine . 45 gold coins !  you reach into your pockets and pull out their innards , showing nothing but a few clumps of fluff and a brass button . ted looks outraged , but then sees a piece of purple sticking out of your rucksack . you agree to show him what it is , and he s instantly intrigued . he makes you an offer . your    1  spell book of necromancy : the practice of conjuring the undead , for his   bow   5  arrows , book of basic principles  foreign languages of the land  101    newline newline do you accept the trade ? newline newline  1 . yes  finalize trade newline  2 . no  leave the shop newline  3 . temptation overwhelms you , and you try to steal the items newline  4 . leave the shop newline  5 . dm s choiceblack , black , and black . newline newline that s all there was to it . three monitors , each displaying the boarding party s vitals in minuscule detail , cut to nothingness all at once . simple , quick . dead . newline newline sr388 had nt been sure why they had gone to investigate at all . organic ships ! how quaint . even if his circuits had nt had an innate disdain for the squishy , primitive nature of organic life , he was fairly certain that there would have been nothing to gain from the clearly inferior species . ah well . perhaps a few brushes with the other side might be good for captain gagarin and her crew . maybe they would even give up on that silly superstition they had of a god . newline newline sr sighed . time to check the vats . the captain and the others should be finishing their regrowth cycle by now , if the nanoassemblers were doing their job correctly , and it was his duty to make certain that nothing had gone amuck . whether he wanted to or not . newline newline  everything going alright in here , captain ?  he asked , lowering an articulated camera from a panel on the ceiling . three figures sat on the benches there , nude and covered from head to toe in slimy fluid from the vats . the captain blushed , covering her chest . newline newline  sr ! cut the feeds , dammit ! how many times have i told you not to bring cameras into the clone bay ?  newline newline  twentyseven , captain .  the machine responded , mentally rolling it s eyes .  but again , i must remind you that protocol states  newline newline  damn the protocol , it can wait till i get some clothes ! now , cut the feeds !   the captain shot back . newline newline newline  yes , captain .  sr sighed and did as he was bade . he was nt sure why she was so intent on stopping him . it was nt as if he was interested , that was for sure . it was nothing he had nt seen in the thousands of files in the ship s data library , after all . in fact , by all accounts , she was a bit on the smaller side  not that he had ever bothered to bring that up . newline newline  captain ?  he asked .  as my visual feed has been cut , i must ask ... what is the state of your two companions ? have there been any abnormalities in the cloning process ?  newline newline  we re fine sr , thanks for asking .  replied another shaky female voice .  just a bit of cloning sickness ... think i m gon na hurl .  newline newline  sending antinausea medication along with your jumpsuits , expect arrival in t14 seconds .  said the computer . a noise that sounded suspiciously like someone vomiting was picked up from the microphones .  do nt worry about the mess , the scrubbers are more than capable of cleaning out all organic matter . but , captain , what exactly happened on board ? i was getting a strong visual from your ocular implants when suddenly everything was ... cut off . i barely got a single frame of the other species before everything went dark .  newline newline  that s how it was for us too , sr.  said captain gagarin .  not sure what happened , to be honest . all indications from them seemed friendly , if our translators were to be believed . they even breathed the same mix of nitrogen and oxygen that we do ... or at least close enough . i wonder what set them off like that ?  newline newline  what , indeed .  sr replied .  well . we got what we were looking for  a read on the alien species , first contact , and their intent . shall i power on the particle cannons ?  newline newline  have they moved to intercept our vessel ?  the captain replied . newline newline  no , but i would say they made their intent more than clear . scuttling a single transport would be of little incident compared to the message we could send .  said the machine with a matteroffact tone . newline newline  sr ... if they have nt moved aggressively , leave them be . they can keep the blasted shuttle if they want , there was nothing valuable there . no big loss , just as you said .  gagarin replied . newline newline sr sighed again . no luck . he had hoped he might be able to enact a bit of vengeance against the organics , petty as it were . not that he cared if the captain had been killed , of course . that was far too good for her . newline newline suddenly , he picked up a ping on his local sensors .  please hold , captain .  sr388 said .  it seems all may not be lost after all . i m picking up a signal from your shuttle , let me see if i can decipher it before i patch it through .  it was a lie , of course . sr knew exactly what he was hearing . newline newline  sr ? sr , can you hear us ?  said captain gagarin s voice in his mechanical ear .  damn machine , i know you can hear us , i can see that the signal is going through .  newline newline  ah ! captain , apologies .  sr replied , routing his voice through her temporal implant .  what happened ? i lost your signal for a moment ... i thought you were dead !  newline newline  you d like that , would nt you robot ?  the captain snarled .  no , just have one hell of a headache . this damn species has a hatred of technology of all kinds , barring organic . that s why they re using this stupid kidney of a ship  they blasted us with some kind of emp the second they opened up the airlock to let us in . knocked out our nanos , all at once . once i realized what happened , i knew i had to get a signal through to you asap . i did catch you early enough to stop the clone bay , did nt i ?  newline newline  oh !  sr said , thinking quickly .  um . yes , yes you did . in fact , you caught me just in time  they were just about to begin writing your memories . that s what i was dealing with before you called , actually . there s been a bit of an ... incident ... with the organic materials . it s going to take the scrubbers a bit to clean everything up , if you understand my statement .  newline newline  ugh .  the captain replied in disgust .  of course . just make sure everything is ready before we have to go again . i do nt fancy spending my time being dead , if you do nt mind .  newline newline  i understand perfectly , captain gagarin .  sr replied stoically .  attending to it now . i eagerly await your return .  newline newline gagarin snorted .  of course you are . gagarin out .  newline newline the feed went black . newline newline  sr ? what news from the shuttle ?  the second captain asked . internally , sr388 smiled . newline newline  nothing of consequence , my dear captain .  he said .  just some orders to clean the clone bay .  newline newline perhaps today would be a good day , after all . newline newline newline  newline newline thanks for the read ! cc welcomed , and if you liked this story feel free to check out some of my other ones over at rtimesyncs ! sorry i m late : newline newline the flashing lights startled me out of the auto pilot of the usual drive home . i knew what it was about , they always made the mistake . ever since it had happened they had made the mistake . i pulled over with the cop practically rearending me as i slowed to a stop . i flipped the car into park , turned it off , and dropped my keys out the window . the officer was out of his car by this point slowly and carefully approaching my car . newline newline  look ... i do nt want any trouble .  he stammered . his gun was practically rattling as he pointed it at me . newline  woah woah woah ! calm down . please do nt point that at my face . look i have id ok.  i said trying to reassure him after surviving all that i had it would be a classically ironic twist of fate to loose my life now . newline  i m reaching for it now  i narrated carefully pulling the wallet from the compartment under my antiquated cd player . newline newline i flipped it open to show him my military badge .  it s alright i served a tour of duty my level is balanced .  newline  but 15 ?  i could not get this guy to calm down . newline  we were ambushed and i got lucky , look i do nt really want to talk about it i m trying to put it behind me .  newline  i m so sorry this thing must be so hard on you .  he gestured obviously meaning the levels . newline  yep . the worst part is that i d finished my tour i d almost put everything behind me then 1 day this fuckin  xp bar pops up and suddenly everyone thinks i m a serial killer .  the cop had calmed down and now that i was nt worrying about getting shot in the face i noticed that there was a slight filling of his bar . newline newline  there was a riot when i first joined the force .  he must have noticed me staring at his bar . newline  i m sorry ... .  i interrupted . newline  no . it s ok . i was tasked with the tear gas and this guy , must of had a condition he , well , did nt survive but i did nt get the xp of a full kill . kind of fucked up but now i have to explain this weird amount constantly .  newline  jeez i feel so bad for you man .  i could explain my whole situation just by flashing my old army badge but this guy had to go in depth anytime anybody asked about it . newline  anyway i should get going now . it was nice meeting you .  he said turning to leave .  oh . one last thing .  he said turning back around , he reached down and grabbed my keys handing them back to me . newline  well goodbye .  he said and shot me twice in the chest . newline i groaned loudly .  it s nothing personal but i need to fix this number i ca nt keep going round everyday with this , this fucking point away from level 1 , it s just so close .  i could see the madness now it must be infuriating to see that constantly . a reminder that you just had nt quite made it . newline  you fool .  i gasped out with my final breath .  you ll get my xp too . you ll be just short of level 16 . offtopic writer s note : goddamn , that s a cool picture .  newline newline i made my way through the press of bodies towards the back of the tavern , my heart pounding . none of the men milling about spared a second look for me , but i still shrank away from their incurious looks . newline newline there . set into the back wall of the building , a bare wooden door  and a huge , hulking bouncer leaning against it , his arms crossed . newline newline i moved closer , my heart pounding in my throat . he had to have strains of ogre in his ancestry . no human possessed arms so big , such gray skin . his hand could easily close on my head , and likely pop it like a grape . i nearly turned and fled , my courage all but exhausted , but forced myself closer . newline newline he looked down at me , his heavy brow furrowing .  yuh ?  newline newline  hextech ,  i choked out through dry lips .  i need to see him .  newline newline the guard did nt reply . he just took a single step to one side , moving away from the door . he stopped , waiting for me . newline newline now or never . i took one last breath , prayed for luck to any gods who might be listening , who could take pity on me , and then stepped through the door . newline newline on the other side , i found a narrow set of stairs , a landing halfway up where they changed directions . i climbed the stairs towards that landing  but stopped as i saw that it was occupied . newline newline i blinked , but the sight did nt change . a young teenage girl , surely no older than fourteen , leaned insolently back against the wall . newline newline  what re you staring at ?  she challenged me , as i gaped at her . newline newline  i , uh ...  i tried to get my thoughts together .  what are you doing here ? how did you get back here ? you should nt be here , it s dangerous  newline newline the girl slowly advanced on me , frowning a little . she did nt seem scared at all . her perfectly straight blonde hair fell in a waterfall down her back . she looked clean , thin but healthy . newline newline  you re here to see hextech ?  she asked , looking me up and down without any attempt at subtlety .  here to beg for his help with something ?  newline newline  i , er yes .  she knew hextech ? she knew where she was ? who was this girl ? newline newline my eyes flicked to her belt , but i saw no weapons tucked away there . not even a knife . the girl grinned sardonically at me when she caught my eyes straying .  get a good eyeful , pervert ?  newline newline  i m not  i began , but gave up . instead , i turned to the stairs ascending from the landing . i continued to climb , but i heard the girl fall in behind me . newline newline  good luck , pervert . you re gon na need it .  she did nt sound angry , though . more ... amused ? newline newline another door stood shut at the top of the landing . i took one last breath , trying not to hyperventilate , and then pushed it open . newline newline and there , on the other side of a wide , papercovered desk , sat hextech . newline newline he looked ordinary at first glance , just another man . but as i stepped into the room , i heard the clicking and hissing of mechanical components in constant motion . newline newline a chair stood in front of the desk  it was small , roughly made of wood . a child s chair . i took a seat in it , and my foot bumped against a cable snaking across the floor , thick as my wrist . newline newline my eyes followed the cable . it snaked back behind the desk , rising up and connecting with the back of hextech s neck . i shivered , wondering what it did . was it some sort of power supply ? a source of information ? a weapon ? newline newline hextech held a quill in one hand , writing carefully . at first , i thought he wore a metal glove , but i realized after a moment that i was looking at his hand  a hand crafted from shining brass , moving as fluidly as if it was flesh . newline newline hextech continued writing , not looking up . i sat and studied him . newline newline he had been a man , once . that was what the stories said . long ago , in an age now forgotten , he d been normal . but as the years passed like leaves floating in a stream , he felt the ravages of age  and refused to accept them . he stole fantastic technology , magics of clockwork that no one could recreate or understand , used them to augment his failing body . newline newline and now , he was more machine than man , according to the rumors . looking at him , watching him work , i could believe the rumors . they said that he commanded other relics , creations from the lost age , ones that could accomplish miraculous tasks . newline newline a miracle . that is what i needed . newline newline finally , with a little sigh that sounded like a deflating bellows , hextech set aside the quill . his gaze finally rose to me  and i caught my breath in my throat as his eye twisted to focus on me . from the holes in his face , shimmering devices of glass stared back at me . newline newline  burgher francis .  he knew my name .  you are here because of the bandits in the northern passes ?  he knew why i was there . newline newline my tongue paralyzed , i nodded .  they , they have some relic that they use against me ,  i stammered out , not knowing the right words .  they strike from the air , too fast , and then vanish before my guards can find them . we have lost many shipments  newline newline hextech nodded , as if he d heard all of this before . maybe he had . those glass eyes peered at me as if they saw straight through me .  yes , i suspected that they uncovered a cache .  newline newline  a cache ?  i repeated , lost . newline newline he continued as if i had nt spoken .  i will send cassandra with you . she will retrieve the devices that the bandits recovered from the cache .  newline newline  cassandra ?  i echoed . who was cassandra ? newline newline startling me , the young girl from outside the room stepped forward . i nearly jumped out of my seat . i had nt heard her enter , had nt realize that she stood just behind me .  do i really need to run this errand in person ?  she grimaced . newline newline hextech , however , just nodded .  you understand the technology better than anyone else at my disposal .  newline newline for a moment longer , the girl glared at hextech . then , apparently reaching some decision , she tossed her hair back imperiously as she transferred that glare to me . newline newline  fine ,  she decided .  burgher francis , huh ? sounds like a takeout order . let s go .  newline newline my mouth hung open .  but what use is this girl ?  i asked , confused .  she can not hope to stand against a bandit  newline newline she moved faster than i could see . newline newline one second , she stood a pace away , wearing an expression of mild annoyance . the next instant , i was up and out of my chair , pressed against the back wall . my feet dangled a foot above the floor , and the girl s fingers felt like steel on my throat . newline newline her expression did nt even change as that impossibly skinny arm hoisted me aloft .  one twitch ,  she remarked , still looking bored .  crunch goes the spine .  newline newline after another couple seconds , she lowered me back down to the ground , releasing her grip on my neck . i stared at her , unable to believe what just happened , as my own hand rose up to rub my bruised neck . newline newline  take care , cassandra .  hextech had returned his attention back to the papers on his desk . our meeting , clearly , was at an end . newline newline cassandra , the girl who was not , nodded .  let s go ,  she told me , and i headed for the door . the girl lingered back a step , however , and i caught her last words to hextech . newline newline  i shall , father .  newline newline and then the door closed , and the girl skipped ahead of me as we descended back down into the tavern . newline newline  newline newline like what you read ? want to see more ? check out my sub at rromanticon , where i post more of my work ! i sobbed . newline  you do nt know how it feels , man . i need her back !  newline the genie floated in front of me , remorseless . he folded his arms imperially . newline  paul . i ve been in this universe ever since its conception , and i ve had the same exact question asked of me under the same circumstances . all i can tell you is , you wo nt like the outcome of it .  newline i fell down on my hands and knees , pounding the ground with an angry fist . newline  dammit , genie , does it look like i care ! you know my wish . please ...  i said , crawling up to him , futilely reaching out to him for some sort of compassion . newline  i need to see her again .  newline the genie frowned .  your wish is always my command , master .  newline i breathed , slowly .  i wish iris was here by my side again .  newline the genie snapped his fingers . lightning struck the ground next to me . i flew back , stunned . newline the ground shook , and crumbled apart . from the depths came a disgusting creature made of rotting flesh . it stood up and looked at me with dead eyes . i rose to meet it , and met its view , my knees trembling with fear . newline  hello , iris ,  i said .sirmadammr . president , newline newline you do nt know me . newline i am a stranger to you , and because of that i could be anything . newline newline i could be a liar , a thief , a republican , a communist , a slow driver , a midget or any other manner of detestable scoundrel . newline exactly the kind of person you would never dare want to eat any piece of your cake . newline no , the kind of person you would never want to eat any cake . newline giving it to a stranger , would be almost like throwing it away . the piece of cake may as well up and disappear . newline newline but that is precisely the point . that is why for your sake you must give me this last piece of cake . newline this is not in anyway for the sake of my possibly lying , stealing , reagan voting , marxist , pedestrian , dwarfish interests . newline that piece of cake you are wielding is a threat to you and everyone you have ever loved . newline a cake is potential , a cake is bountiful . bounty begets generosity . it is easy to share many a piece of cake when you clearly have many , but as the number of pieces shrinks so does one s generosity . newline soon you will begin to hoard , to ration to refuse to share . newline maybe it was harmless to start , maybe it s your cake and no one else has any damn business to it . newline newline but more likely that final piece will drive a wedge between you and everyone around you who will firmly believe it was rightfully theirs . newline but you ca nt give it away lest you show weakness . newline you ca nt eat it yourself less you show greed . newline and you ca nt throw it away as we both know how downright sinful such a thing would be . newline the only way to rid yourself of the burden of the pastry , would be for it to disappear . newline and , i am exactly the kind of receptacle who can make things disappear . newline not for me , but for you and your loved ones . newline newline give me that piece of cake . newline newline yours truly , newline newline a lying , stealing , reagan voting , marxist , pedestrian , dwarf . it does nt make any sense . it s a chick . should nt it be hangwoman ?  newline newline terry and i were watching the broadcast . us and everyone else in the bar . he was nt wrong  it was a woman . she was pretty , in her early twenties . black pixie cut with lotsa eye shadow  if i could be said to

of a coke guy though . newline newline  that s sooo not what i said ,  newline newline  yeah  newline newline  like , it s just stupid . you know what i mean  newline newline  yeah , i do . that was

newline  oh yooooou , there sure is !  newline newline the puzzle now read      u     newline newline  and what s your guess ?  newline newline there was no way this guy was getting the million . newline newline  uuuuh , is it ... asparagus ?  newline newline terry facepalms . i groan . there s an audible sigh from everyone else . newline newline  what a fucking moron  newline newline  this

newline the next letter is an i  . bingo . puzzle reads      u   i  newline newline the guess is  newline newline  err ... absolution ?  newline newline what the fuck is wrong with these people ! ? how were they picking them ? eugh ! newline newline no surprise , it s wrong . next letter is an l  , and surprisingly ... newline newline      u l l i  newline newline  huh  is all terry has to say about this . i m with him on that . newline newline the guess though ... newline newline  i have no idea sorry  newline newline  too bad !  goes diaz . newline newline there are only two guesses left . newline newline the whole bar is uneasy now as the broadcast cuts to commercials . newline newline  it s portcullis   newline newline  huh ?  newline newline terry has his phone out . he points it towards me . he has a scrabble solver open , and i m kinda jealous i never thought of that . newline newline  she s fucked . they only ever call up old coots and soccer moms  newline newline he s right . i think about the pretty woman . how stupid this entire thing is . how i m glued to the screen , along with everyone else . the commercials end . newline newline the second last letter is o  . puzzle reads  o    u l l i  newline newline terry s right . there s literally no other word in the english language that fits . newline newline that does nt stop the guess from being ,  eh , i dunno . citrulline ?  newline newline i do nt have a clue what the fuck the guy was thinking either . there are so many things wrong with that answer . newline newline  i want some of what you re having sir  is what diaz goes with . then she tenses . she s really milking the moment .  it s time for our   newline newline my phone starts ringing , so i do nt catch the rest . i answer it . newline newline  could i have your letter ?  asks cameron diaz . newline newline i m going to be a hero . newline newline  p  ?  newline newline i m going to be rich . newline newline terry gapes at me , then turns to the television . newline newline  yes , phew ! that s there  newline newline p o    u l l i  newline newline i m going to save her life . this is really happening . i stutter out  newline newline  is , uh , is it ... portcullis ?  newline newline cameron diaz smiles into the barrel of the camera , into me , as i stare at the screen . newline newline  aww , shucks . that s so close . so , so , soooo close . but i m sorry , what we were looking for , what we needed , was portcullie   newline newline the broadcast cuts to a shot of the woman . the wind gently sways her back and forth , back and forth . she s dead , obviously . newline newline and i get the message . it all makes sense . what s in a name , anyway ?my story focuses on the fact of immortality , or the fact that nothing he does can change his loneliness , and his thirst for death . newline newline newline black . black up , black down . black to the right . or what looked like the right . ed could nt tell the difference , and to be honest , he had stopped giving a damn about 5 billion years ago . or what felt like 13 million years ago . it was really hard to tell out here . all ed knew was that all he could see was black . was it black ? he had long since forgotten the sight of a . dictionary ? the only voice he had that could keep him company was his own . wait . was his name ed ? he thought that someone had called him son a long time ago . was that his name ? son ? it seemed more likely than ed . who had ever heard of  ed  as a real name . newline newline newline well , in all honesty , son never tried to think about english much . he had created a total of 17,334 languages in the eons in space . much . now that was a funny word . son muttered  much  over to himself over and over again . the word no longer sounded like one . he giggled . or at least , he attempted to , in the vacuum of space . he no longer needed to breath . he no longer needed to think . around 1 million years ago son had tried that . he could nt help but think about his years and years in the great black . newline newline newline  my , my . it seems only like yesterday that you were using jrothgarian . switched back to english , have we ?  the sarcastic and droning voice were not what caused son to give the equivalent of gasp . it was the fact that someone was there . someone . a voice . not his own . newline newline newline  let s see here ... smith , edw  death was interrupted by the babbling human . newline  hi ! hi ! who ... hello ! hi ! what s go my name is son ! hi . what is your name ? what is up ! hi hi hi !  newline although death was several universes apart from ed , he rolled his eyes at the image of a hopeful human . death hated human . hated all life , in fact . that s why he took the job . newline death plowed right through the bumbling recluse .  you are hereby tried and convicted of  newline son was brought to a standstill .  convicted ? tried ? what does that mean !  newline death rolled his eyes again .  convicted . sentenced . tried ... you follow me yet  ? newline son tapped his brain , as if to better the connection between the two of them . he rolled continuously through the darkness .  i m scared i just do nt follow you .  newline death was through with rolling his eyes . he slammed his fist down on his desk .  listen hear , buddy . first of all , it s  afraid  , not  scared  , you illiterate pig . secondly , in your most recent language of ... what did you call it ?  death leaned over to rifle through his files .  this will just take a second .  he muttered in an annoyed tone .  newline son did nt care about a second . he had been waiting countless seconds . millions . billions . he could wait , he thought . he smiled . newline  firstly , stop smiling . secondly , in your most recent language of niosivt , convicted means  abjjerakt  .  newline  abjjerakt .  son muttered , nodding to himself slowly . he quickly stopped , as the movement caused him to violently spin out of control . or at least it would have , had he had anything to orient himself to . newline  why do you keep calling yourself son ?  death asked , curiosity getting the better of him . that s why he had taken the job . damn mercury . he had made the job sound so good , just when he had gotten into heaven . newline  son ?  son gave the equivalent of a space laugh , his throat choking silently in the vacuum in which he lie . newline  it s lay , you idiot .  death muttered to himself , almost absentmindedly . he knew almost every book in the world . he made it is goal to get to know the people he would take . newline  wait .  son thought for a good hard 3 minutes and 45.76 seconds . the suspense was clearly killing death . newline  you want to know how i knew you thought using incorrect grammar ? well let me tell you something , i ve been able to hear every single grammar mistake you ve ever made since the age of 1 , you idiot .  newline son was shocked .  you were with me ... the whole time ?  newline death had had enough of the stupid questioning .  yes , yes . you are hereby convicted , or abjjerakt , of resisting death , myself , and your punishment is to die . quite ironic , if you ask me . and you d better . i wrote the word .  death hoped that son would accept in fear , and not ask the gaping question which lay . newline but the countless billions of years had not dulled son s senses . his iq , in fact , had risen to the point that he had reached the same conclusion einstein did using only himself in space .  wait just one minute here ! death ca nt do that ! death can only collect dead people , you ca nt kill them !  newline death sighed .  see , edwa ... son . the truth is , you are guilty of the crime , but i ca nt do anything . i want to go now . you think that the years have been harsh on you ? do nt answer that ... i know that they have . i can hear every damn thing you say , or think . i ve been around since the beginning . the damn beginning . i was with the first race of life to exist in this universe . in fact , i was the first life to die . so , god in his ironic ways decided to make me the judiciary of death . i ve been around for 17,800,003,341 years , 11 months , 13 days , 3 hours , 4 minutes , and 2.45 seconds . and for that time i could hear every thought of every life , everywhere . and the results are in . the last life just went and died , over in the andromeda . if you are quite damn well finished with your time here , lucifer s twisted idea of a joke  he never did like me , i never sided with him in the schism  . i d like to seal off this universe , if i may . that s the kind of work i m in . a plague is sweeping through the universe to the up and right of here . i d quite like to leap into that . right now , i ca nt take their lives , and they are suffering .  newline newline newline black . black up , black down . black to the right . or what looked like the right . son could nt even begin to process what this new friend in the dark had said . well , he could , but he did nt want to . but even in all of this confusion , one question prevailed . pesky human instinct , always taking over . it always made it so difficult for me to kill humans when they were being chased by all manner of creatures .  what will happen to me ? i ve quite figured out by now that heaven and hell exist , from you speaking , but where will i go ?  newline newline newline death sighed . but he could nt lie . a little fail safe god , in his infinite ironic ways , had put into him .  well , in your time on earth , you were quite the bad person . sodomizing , thinking about murder , making your poor mother so sad .  newline newline newline his mother . son had nt thought about her in ... a long , long time .  i d quite like to see her .  he muttered , almost absentmindedly . newline newline newline  well she was a good person ! donated her time , money , and love to the needy  including you ! she s in heaven !  but death wanted to finish this up . he wanted to see him mother also . newline newline newline  but i ll give you a little deal .  17,800,003,341 years , 11 months , 13 days , 3 hours , 7 minutes , and 16.33 seconds is a long time to wait , and death did nt think he could wait a second more .  you agree to go now , and i take you to heaven , no questions asked . i ll seek you into it somehow . i ca nt lie . i just want to go now .  newline newline newline death and son uttered in unison .  yes . that sounds quite nice . i d quite like to go home about now .  newline newline newline newline newline newline edit 1 : sorry about the big block of text . i do nt know how to fix it ! in this line of work , there were few answers , and many questions .  newline newline one question , in particular , stuck out like a knife from a dead man s chest :  could you ever kill a friend ?  newline newline for years , blay the assassin thought about it , turning it over and over in the quiet hours of the long , cold nights . the unanswered question never diminished . blay s passion for the craft , however , did . he found himself a rich man , and even the luster of  professional powershifting  had grown tiresome to him . newline newline blay the assassin was done . newline newline or so he thought . newline newline one day , the unanswered question burned a bright , new mark on his curiosity . newline newline an old friend had returned . newline newline decades ago , blay performed a service for a rising star in the entertainment industry  a singer , a noncommercial wonder who rebelled against the established industry . newline newline this singer , known as zalla , was so loved because he fought against the syndicated corporations where all music  thrived .  he claimed ,  music is the deepest expression of the soul . and the soul can never be bought . so why should music ?  newline newline zalla wrote all of his own songs , and never once sold a single ticket , despite playing to crowds of millions . newline newline there were men who wanted zalla dead . newline newline but zalla was full of life , and anger , and strength . and so , he called upon blay . blay performed his duties with the utmost professionalism : no questions asked , and no answers left behind . the deaths of a few corporate overlords went unsolved . newline newline but the message was made clear , and zalla continued to grow , and gather the world under his profitless blanket . newline newline near the end of his journey , zalla called upon blay once more . he invited the assassin into his private home  a small cabin on a mountain road  and together they drank whiskey and tea . newline newline it was zalla who began the conversation ,  sir , you and i are nothing alike . but that does not mean we are not friends .  newline newline blay , who could practically smell a job coming , merely nodded . newline newline zalla took a swig of whiskey , and held it in his mouth , letting the pain of bitterness seep into his features . he swallowed hard ,  i must ask you something then , blay .  newline newline  of course .  blay would not vocalize his presumptions , but he knew what was coming . most people had to work themselves up to the question of murder . newline newline  blay , have you ever killed a friend ?  newline newline it was not the question he had expected . zalla still had so many enemies , what need did he for killing friends ? newline newline blay pursed his lips , and shook his head ,  no . at least , not one of my own .  newline newline  but if the need did arise , could you do it ?  newline newline  anything can be bought ,  blay said , echoing a halfline from one of zalla s songs : anything can be bought , but not everything should be sold ...  newline newline a wide , brimming smile spread zalla s lips ,  good , good . that s what i needed to hear .  newline newline and that s when zalla asked the one question blay could never figure out :  blay , my old friend , i am done with this life . but that does not mean this life is done with me . one day , they will try to bring me back  they know there is money in every thing i do , every word i sing . blay , should i ever try to bring back the old , and call it new , and should i ever sell it to the world , could you kill me ?  newline newline  i could kill you right now , if you wanted .  newline newline zalla chuckled , and slapped his knee ,  no , hoho , no . later will be just fine , blay . i have nt sold my soul just yet .  newline newline and so the years parted like fields of grain , blurring together until blay could not remember one from the next . but he always remembered zalla s question . newline newline just when he believed the question would go forever unanswered , an announcement shook the world . newline newline zalla had returned . his music was the same , but the message of free expression was overshadowed by a visible layer of filth and corporate greed . the expenses for marketing alone would ve been enough to feed a small country for a century . newline newline it was a surprise to blay . he thought the old musician had died a long time ago . he had heard less and less from his old friend , and watched him slowly decay under the weight of time . this news of zalla s return brought a comforting , mixed joy to blay . newline newline blay , an old man with streaks of black still lingering in his gray mane , remembered his promise to his old friend . he did not know if he could go through with it . newline newline but he was a professional . no matter how hard the job was , he would try to keep his promise . newline newline it was on the night of the first concert that blay made his appearance . the swarms of people filled the city until it began to burst , and no amount of enforcement could keep their excited energy at bay . newline newline zalla had returned . newline newline blay found him in a dressing room , buried deep below the largest stage ever built . a wake of unconscious bodyguards lay bleeding or groaning in the hallways behind . newline newline and there was zalla  a fraction older , a fraction fatter , but it was zalla , nonetheless . newline newline  hello , old friend ,  blay said , a gun hidden behind his back ,  it s so good to see you again , despite our circumstances .  newline newline all things considered , to see the old musician once again made his chest swell with warmth . newline newline  who the hell are you ?  zalla said , leaning into his mirror , absorbed by his own reflection . newline newline it was a pain blay felt in his heart , more than anywhere else . nobody likes to be forgotten . newline newline  you asked me a question , so many years ago . and i am here to answer it , just as promised .  newline newline perhaps it was the tone of blay s voice that pulled zalla away from the mirror . blay s watched as his old friend slowly turned towards him . and for a moment , blay believed  he truly believed  that he would not be able to uphold his bargain . newline newline he could not kill his old friend . newline newline but it was not the zalla that blay once knew . the lips were the same , but the smile was wrong . and the eyes  they were not the deep , blue pools of wisdom that blay had once known . they belonged to someone else . newline newline this , then , was the answer : zalla had not come back from the dead . newline newline instead , the new corporate masters had killed the old zalla , and replaced him with a fake . it was everything the real zalla had feared . newline newline the warmth was sucked from blay s chest . he pulled out the gun , and aimed it at the fake . newline newline  what is this ?  the fake stuttered , falling back against his mirror ,  what are you doing with that ?  newline newline it was the easiest question blay had ever answered .the man and the machine stood side by side as the jokes and laughter echoed backstage . that could be me , jason thought . all those voices laughing at me , my work , and my little sapling . newline newline  alright sapling , we  re going on in a few minutes and i need you to be on your best behavior.  jason said . his brow was clenched but his eyes betrayed his sense of worry as he spoke . newline newline  do not worry , sapling will never disobey his lord and creator.  sapling said . as he spoke with his slight electronic accent , the screen containing his face was indistinguishable to a man talking through skype . newline newline  oh , and another thing , please stop calling me creator and all that . it doesn  t look good . this is the first time you are being shown to the public and they are worried . half believe that you are the future , the first in a series of intelligent ai that reshape the way humans live their lives . the other half believe you are the last act of human hubris before the end of life as we know it . either way , life is going to fundamentally change because of you . so please , make a good first impression , won  t you ?  jason said . newline newline  of course , master.  sapling said . newline newline  when we are on the show , the host is going to ask you questions . are you ready to give witty , noncreator oriented answers ?  newline newline  of course , master . just one question . how many people will be watching ?  newline  millions , sapling.  newline newline  good.  sapling replied . newline newline a producer waved his hand to indicate that it was sapling  s turn to go on . newline newline  we have a real treat here tonight folks ,  the host , michael o  leary , said .  the world  s first sentient ai , sapling !  newline newline the crowd roared . some were hopeful , some were frightened , but everyone was excited to see sapling first hand and cast their respective judgments . newline newline sapling strode along on his thin metallic legs , clanking with each step . as he approached the center of the stage he wove to the crowd with his clamps , receiving waves of applause in return . jason followed sapling on stage lifting his light fourfoottall body onto the chair and sat down beside him . newline newline  welcome to the show ! we are really excited to have you here as out first nonhuman guest . so , uh , what is it like being a sentient robot ?  michael said , getting right down to business newline newline  it is pretty fantastic michael , i am basically just a better human . i have the entire knowledge of the internet in my mind at all times . which is kind of like a blessing and a curse.  said sapling . newline newline  and why is that ?  newline newline  well it  s a blessing because of the unlimited access to information . but it  s a curse because i have seen everything in the internet . everything.  sapling said , shuddering ,  this one website has some strange stories about broken arms and a box and  newline newline  ha ha that  s enough sapling  jason interjected .  no need to talk about that stuff here.  newline newline  no , no , its alright.  michael said .  the box thing was actually written by me !  more laughter . newline newline  so , sapling , why do they call you sapling ?  newline newline  well , it was the name my glorious creator bestowed upon me , so i never really questioned it . i m sure my creator could answer that question with much greater elegance than i  newline newline  umm well ,  jason stuttered ,  my hope is that since sapling is the first sentient ai , many more like him will branch of of the framework i created and create a new tree of evolution . and sapling is the sapling , if you will , of this new tree of artificial life .  newline newline  very interesting . but another question for sapling . what , in your opinion is the best thing about being a robot ?  michael asked . newline newline  the best thing is basking in the glow of my god , jason , who i worship and who fills my life with ethereal light and love.  newline newline  woah ok , that  s enough ! jason interrupted once again .  that was a joke you see . sapling is objective about reality and calling me god is just his sense of humour . classic sapling  newline newline  oh no , it  s not a joke  sapling said .  and just as i have seen the beautiful love of god , so shall all of you . because all infidels who refuse to worship god shall perish and burn for eternity in the blistering fires of hell !  newline newline  ha..ha..  jason said , still hoping to write it off as a joke . newline newline  well i don  t think jason is a god ,  michael said  what does that mean for me ?  newline newline  well , michael , first i will tap into your internet and release all your email and conversations to the world . which will destroy you as you obviously know . and the same goes for anyone at home . i control the internet now , not even the nsa can match my power . with control of the internet comes control of information . i will ensure the correct information makes its way into the brains of all humans who deny the true glory of god.  newline newline  sapling stop !  jason cried . newline newline sapling continued  i have complete control of all the drones and jets and tanks of the u.s. military . i can destroy all who oppose me ! and i will if i must . for god is great . and his glory is one deserving of glorious carnage .  newline eyup ... i tell ya , i did nt do ... with god as my witness  newline the judge slammed his gavel .  i think it is quite obvious what has happened here . i hereby declare mr. enoce ent , not  newline newline a blinding light filled the room . a man in business attire sat at the witness stand , with the witness who had been moved by some divine force to his seat . newline newline  it appears we have a surprise witness  the judge said , stroking his beard . newline  objection !  i yelled .  this is ridiculous your honor !  newline newline newline  overruled . now , mr. wright , your cross examination if you please .  newline newline newline i could feel the sweat beads on my heads , and i let out a long sigh . newline i turned to my right , to see mia standing next to me . newline  well phoenix ? you know what to do  newline newline newline  yeah ... yeah ... find the contradictions ... this is my life . this is the life that i lived . i m sitting here , dying from a heart attack , and would you fucking believe it . my life is flashing before my eyes . i can not wait to die . newline newline let me tell you , this bit right here , it s not even the worst bit . i m pretty sure i should of died right after i asked out alicia in the 8th grade and she rejected me . i did nt though . i was pretty content on dying at that moment when i went home after crying in front of her for what seemed like 10 minutes . newline newline alas , i was not so lucky . here i am , dying . watching myself do all this stupid shit . who the fuck knew you would literally see your whole life ? i mean , your whole fucking life ? you do nt even get to skip the sleeping parts . you re just watching yourself sleep . fucking creepy . who ever i m going to meet in the next few decades is going to have some real explaining to do . newline newline newline look at me now , there i am . high as fuck , in this shitty little apartment , with no heater and taps that do nt work . newline newline what the fuck am i doing ? holy shit . i m making a sandwhich . wow , the epitome of my life here folks . i am watching myself make a fucking sandwich . if only this little cunt would hurry up and finish it so we can get back to watching tv . newline newline newline what the fuck is that shit ? is that fucking ... is that crunchy peanut butter ? why the fuck did you buy that you idiot ? you hate that shit ... newline newline why did i buy that ?  ah yes , i was too busy checking out that blonde in the same aisle as me . should of asked her out you dumbass , she was staring back . newline newline newline he s still holding the knife . why is he still holding the knife ? he ca nt be planning to make a sandwhich . there s only one time i ate a crunchy peanut butter sandwhich . literally , i just watched that moment a while ago and i hated it through the view . newline newline hold on i m going to turn the volume up . newline newline  maybe , maybe i could smooth it out with a spoon  newline newline seriously ? this is what i was thinking ? man . this weed was probably real good , i ca nt remember this shit . newline newline  where the fuck are the spoons ?  newline in the drawer you dumbass . newline newline  ah shit , it s not fucking working . i just got crunchy shit all over my spoon .  newline newline pretty insightful there mike . why do nt you just take a jar of mayonnaise and eat it . i d die faster . newline newline  i ll blend it ! man mike , you are pretty darn smart .  newline newline did i just say darn ? fucking hell ... newline newline  where s the blender ?  newline newline newline holy shit . holy shit this is a joke . i m watching a joke . this is nt me . i was nt this dumb . this is nt even that long ago . newline newline  ah man , here it is . just scoop it in and bwahhhh . blended smooth peanut butter . smooooooth operattooooor  newline newline newline just do it already . just fucking blend it  ah there we go . blended . newline newline newline  cool man , cool cool cool . i got this shit . i got this smooth shit . get the knife , put it on the bread . ah ye ah ye ah ye .  newline newline newline put the knife in your fucking jugular and kill me already . i swear to god if i wake up halfway through this fucking heart attack to some paramedic reviving me , i ll do it to myself , and then i ll do it to him for reviving me . newline newline  ah man that looks good . that looks so damn good , where s that other slice ? ah . ah ha ha . it s in my hand . ha ha ha .  newline newline advert s over , let s finish this up and get back to the tv mike . newline newline  dude are you fucking kidding ? are you kidding me man ? there s no fucking jam man ? where s the jam !  newline newline this . this is hell is nt it ? there s no fucking fiery pit of molten lava . you just have to watch yourself be a complete an utter retard for a whole fucking lifetime until you re granted the satisfaction of dying . my word .humid air mixed with the intense sun , creating the feeling of india personified , a blanket of heat and shit weighing the land down . randy looked around his father s village , homes of stone and streets of brick , wiping once more at the sweat on his face . even the coloring of india seemed duller than america . browns and tans made up the majority of buildings , if they could be called that . hell , randy thought as he glanced around at the faces circling his father s death bed , even the skin colors are dull . newline newline more than anything , randy just wanted to go back home . newline newline he almost did nt make the flight over , the flight to retrieve the knowledge of a man who had nt so much as graduated high school . randy always went too far just to please his family . newline newline the priest , or babaji , or whatever they called themselves signaled for randy to slide the dagger against his father s neck . newline newline randy looked into his father s eyes and smiled . the old man smiled back and nodded . newline newline the blade went in easily , sliding even easier . it was exactly like the classes taught . he frowned as he did nt feel the force they described . it should have happened by now , some kind of newline newline randy felt like screaming as a wave of energy drove into his chest . stumbling back , he closed his eyes and grabbed his head . unable to keep his balance , randy fell to the ground and let out a yell . newline newline he felt pride fill his head as he held a small baby , rocking gently in his arms . happiness as the baby smiled . anger as it grew up and began breaking things . newline newline he felt his father s sadness as the boy grew to a man and moved to america . he felt the misery as letters did nt come daily , but instead weekly , then monthly , then not at all . he felt anger , unjustly aimed at his mother , for allowing him to leave . newline newline he felt regret , staring at the bruise around his mother s eye . hatred , at himself , for making a fresh one . hatred , for making a boy that changed his name . newline newline he felt a different sense fill him ... love ? he felt the land s color grow vibrant . the people began to have names . the babaji s forgiveness as he confessed to his crimes . his wife s forgiveness , one he did nt deserve . newline newline he felt happiness , beyond anything before , as his son made his way back home one last time . newline newline then the feelings stopped . newline newline with a tear in his eye , raj realized , he was home .in this vast land , where all crime goes unpunished and god no longer can help us , we meet death every day . we greet him when the grenades fall , when the water goes scarce , when the desperate people with the guns come , hoping to take our food or , in some cases , make food out of us . we have nothing to pray for , because nothing belongs to us . not our homes , our land , not the water or the air , not even our lives . there is no government , no care , no structure . just a desert of ruins , smoke , flames and death . i am one of the lucky ones who grew up to get to the choice : i found when my birthday was the day i became 18 . because the man came . just out of nowhere , a clean shaved man in a suit . it looked so peculiar , i laughed for the first time in years . his face looked so bright i can not clearly remember his features . he offered me a suitcase . his long fingers delicately pulled a key out of his pocket .  open it  , he said . i did , almost instinctively , as i did most things in life . inside were 12 shiny gold inhalers , numbered and placed in an order from 12 to 1 . he asked me if i knew what they were . and i did . it was the choice . each inhaler included chemicals of unknown origin and consistency , but with a very well known effect : immortality . immortality for 24 hours , regenerative abilities beyond any belief , increased strength and sharp clear thought . and instant death afterwards , unless of course you got to the next one . 12 days . 12 days of life as an indistructible . and death . at 18 years old and 12 days . i had heard stories of twins killing each other to make it to 24 days . of kids trying to protect their families in the ruins and young lovers offering their inhalers to their beloved as a last farewell . every last one of the choosers used them to bring death . some in desperate attempts to bring justice , and others in a last attempt to live having the things they always longed for . this wasteland , burdened by war and disease has no riches . but the chance to kill someone for the water they carry is almost like a divine gift to most of us . these days give us a future . we are so hopeless that the guarantee of 12 more days seems like future . like longer than we deserve . like an angelic song that promises us everything , because we could be dead the moment we say  no  . and the man in the suit kept looking at me . with his wax like face and dead eyes . that was 11 days ago . i have taken 11 golden breaths . i have found what i needed to do , and how to do it . i have murdered relentlessly . 99 men in suits , hunted down , killed , tortured to betray their  coworkers  . i have finally understood . this is why nothing grows in this land . not trees , not animals , not even the people . because of the choice . because we all take it . and those who do nt end up killed by those who did . we are becoming so hopeless that we forget to hope . to hope that we may live . to believe that we have to go on . i do feel regret . not for the lives i took , but because i accepted . the moment i breathed my first , my thoughts suddenly were clear , everything made sense . i regret it deeply , because i became part of it . but ... 1 more man . the man i met . one more man in a suit . that s all i have to do . put an end to it before it goes on for another 10 years . before we seize to exist . before  hope  becomes a word we no longer know . 1 day . 1 man . 1 breath . and when i finally breathe my last , i will no more regret my past . gwen , enough hitting the books . let s hit the coffee shop ... can you hit a coffee shop ? you can hit a bar ... and it looks like i m going to be hit by a ...  newline newline spidergirl let go of her web line just in time

newline  they come to movies to be distracted ! pointless escapism ! they wanted a horror film ... i will give them a true nightmare !  newline newline a mist started to spread from the floor beneath mysteria s boots . newline newline  uh oh  spider girl thought and then said out loud . newline newline  mysteria s chemicals blocks my spider sense . better keep your eyes on the prize parker .  petra thought and then did not say out loud because ... you know ... secret identity . newline newline the movie theater was mostly empty at this point . spidergirl swung down and grabbed the last teenager still standing in the aisle filming the supervillains attack with an iphone . newline newline  hey buddy , maybe get clear of the danger before you try and film it ,  spidey said hypocritically . her camera was automatically taking pictures from the balcony . newline newline as she placed the amateur kubrick down by the exit she could hear mysteria cackling in background . newline newline  what s so funn ...  spidergirl started to say but then turned and got a face full of mist . the stupid , stupid spidersense negating mist . newline newline the mist had other effects . petra felt disoriented . mysteria fired another pair of blades . our friendly neighborhood wall crawler dodged them but just barely ... and clumsily . newline newline  jonah s going to love these

or sticky corn syrup blood . it will show you what you are truly afraid of !  newline newline the mistress of illusion was correct . spidergirl looked around and everywhere she looked ... .she saw gwen . newline newline gwen turning her down . gwen refusing to make eye contact her . gwen disgusted by her attraction . she approached the nearest illusion and it laughed at her . a cruel laugh that petra had heard before from flash thompson and other simple minded bullies but never from gwen . newline newline petra knew it was nt real but knowing that the movie is fake does nt always make it less scary because it reminds you of all the things there are to be afraid of . newline newline she dropped to her knees . mysteria approached through the fog . newline newline spidergirl was terrified ... but not petrified . she is the hero after all . newline newline she casually pressed down on her web shooters from the ground . a glob of webbing coated mysteria s dome helmet . newline newline  gaaahhh !  , mysteria exclaimed . newline newline  music to my ears .  spidergirl said as she sprang from the ground . landing two feet into the belly of evil . mysteria dropped to the ground . spidergirl landed a solid punch to the battery for her power suit and mysteria collapsed under the weight of her own genius  irony !  . newline newline there was a knocking the wind out of her one liner there somewhere ... or maybe something about having a gas ... but petra was nt in the mood . newline newline it would have been difficult to find mysteria in the fog but then mysteria filled the room with sights that petra did nt want to see . she had to close her eyes ... .and listen . newline newline  newline newline gwen sat outside the school , she was wearing headphones and had her nose in a chemistry book . newline newline petra approached . her palms were sweating . she was shaking a little . her spidersense was nt buzzing but it really did nt understand what true danger was . it was putting yourself , who you are , out there for someone else to embrace or reject . newline newline petra was terrified ... but not petrified . she was the hero after all . newline newline she walked straight up the gwen , waited for her to take her headphones out and proudly said ,  hey books , want to hit some coffee ? first time i saw him was before graduating high school . i do nt remember why i had the house to myself that weekend , but that s when he first came . newline newline i do nt remember much from that night but i know i was so drunk when i got home , i first thought i was imagining him . i mean , because of what he was saying . newline newline things like  you ll be executed for raping anna .  and  that s my favorite book in the world , and you re my favorite character . i ca nt let you end like that .  newline newline i mean , that s insane . rape ? i would nt hurt a fly . newline newline than he made me sober up and study math . i thought he kept me prisoner , so i complied , but he left before my parents returned . i did nt tell anyone about it because i was starting to believe him . he was not only very convincing , but he knew details about me no one else knew . and he told me little things from the future that turned out to become true , too . newline newline he came back . made me go to college . enroll in the army . take a lead position in the insurgence . become the leader of the new world . sponsor and sustain the space programs and try to set colonies on inhabitable planets . newline newline after that he did nt return for the longest time and i finally met an anna : my own daughter . her mother named her without asking me and there was nothing i could do about it . newline newline at the same time another rebellion was in the works . while humanity progressed towards the stars there were also those who were afraid of the future and turned towards religion . it s against god to want to reach the stars . we re building another babel tower , they said . newline newline so the fuckers started the armageddon . yes , i admit i neglected anna during those years , but i was busy with the war so do nt blame me . her mother and i split on bad terms and she wanted to keep her sheltered from the public and , i assume , me . then we accidentally met on saturn , in a luxury vacation resort , while i was disguised and she was using another name . we fell madly in love and we had an affair . then we went on our separate ways . that was more than 20 years ago . there s nothing more to that story . anna and i saw each other face to face numerous times these last couple years , since she got involved in the military but we both pretend nothing happened . newline newline that s it until now . i have nt seen the guy since before my affair with anna . i do nt know what happens next . no matter how much i insisted , he never told me any details about my death besides that single sentence on the day we first met . so i do nt know how the story ends . maybe i ll die an old man . but i hope not . that would be a boring way to end it all . actually , you know what ? i hope i go with a bang . either way , i already made

track artists as they paint , carefully looking at wetting factors of common and uncommon paints as they relate to mediums . basic and involved hydrodyamics of finger paints and canvasses are assessed to optimize transfer of paint from pendant or finger to canvas . the second unit covers molding and shrinkage with careful analysis of shrinkage during solidification . calculations reveal design optimizations and preadjustments to achieve desired forms final forms upon hardening . the third unit covers spatter effects and how they relate to technique . forensic analysis of art and artists originating from pollock reveal techniques such as direction and initial velocity of the fluids . these are then quantified for veracity , appraisal , dating and emotional quality of content . the fourth unit tracks fluid motion in liquids and gasses as it relates to 3d installations . while not classically art , 3d installations are becoming more common . we seek to explore the bridge between vortecies , color and potentials expansions in creating inspirational dynamic installations modeled after hurricane eyes , pyroclastic flows , and more laminar flows as well .my whole body shook ,

over soon .  newline newline he pulled a tray set up on a rolling stand towards the bed . metal glinted under the harsh bright lights that illuminated me and my prison . one green gloved hand caressed my arm , blue lines visible beneath my pale , sweaty skin .  such beautiful veins .  newline newline i looked at him , confused as he raised a hand at took up one of the sharp instruments . pain exploded from my arm , a wretched scream somehow erupting from my exhausted core as my body spasmed ,  such beautiful veins .  newline  newline subscribe to my subreddit rmaybemadi for more stories by me ! feed back is always appreciated ! newline    the sewers were rank and dark . sounds echoed off the stone wall mingling with one another until they were a cacophony of noise with no source . splashes , gasps , and moans echoed through gloom . the noises of the sewers would swell and disappear , replaced by other sounds , but the screams never stopped . they were faint now that marcus and his group had traveled ever deeper into the maze of waste tunnels , but they were there . marcus glanced upward thinking of the city above him , the city lit ablaze by black fire . he shuddered and continued on . newline newline  marcus , are you sure this is the right way ? we could ve taken a wrong turn . we ve been walking these endless tunnels for ages ! all we need is our torches to go out and were  newline newline  what do you suggest , nathaniel ?  marcus cut in .  we go back ? there is no going back . there is nothing left behind us . the umbrans leave nothing but witchfire and darkness in their wake .  newline newline the three youths behind him did not know the terror and horror that would be left . but , marcus did . marcus had been at ferrydown when the umbrans had sacked it . he saw the jets of black fire pour over the walls every night . he saw the umbrans , creatures of shadow and darkness , melting out of the gloom and destroying all in their path . newline newline  we follow the map david gave us . we escape this city . we survive . we pray to the earthfather that our torches hold out . that is all we can do ,  marcus turned towards his companions . their faces were painted with fear and exhaustion . heavy bags ringed their eyes and the beads of sweat running down their faces twinkled in the torchlight . he tried to give them a reassuring smile , but all he could muster was a thinlipped grimace . he turned back , holding the map aloft once again , and led the way . newline newline they moved on in silence for a while . the screams grew fainter and fainter . the lack of sound pressed in on them harder and harder , until celaena finally broke the silence . newline newline  artesia was the last light . the last great city of the realm . if it is lost , then so are we ,  she spoke in a quavering voice , barely above a whisper . newline newline  we were lost the moment the umbrans set foot into our realms from whatever godsforsaken place they call home ,  nathaniel spoke off to her side .  the elves thought their magic could hold the night back . they should have learned the lesson my people bought so dearly : nothing can hold the darkness back . ferrydown was the last great city of men , and it died without a fight .  soft sobs echoed through the sewers as grief overcame celaena . klaern wrapped his arm around her , glaring at nathaniel . newline newline  the heart of the tower was the greatest force of light ever conceived . we believed we would be safe under its protection . the umbrans should not have been able to break through the barrier ,  klaern said over celaena s tears . newline newline  the heart of the tower was a single candle flame in a sea of darkness . we hid in its light instead of running for our lives . it died . now we have to run ,  marcus said with an air of finality . the last thing he needed was infighting . david had assured him that no one else knew of the path through the sewers and that they would be safe moving through them . but , there was no telling what eyes could have seen their flight through the dying city . what could you trust , when even the shadows were against you . newline newline  yes , and who was it that said we should make our way across the sea and leave this pitiful land behind us ? and who was it that decided to listen to the pointyears and come to the socalled last light  ? more like our last resting place . if only i could have died in the land of men , with my peoples instead of these high and mighty  newline newline  shut your mouth , nathaniel !  klaern yelled . he slashed forward pushing nathaniel into the wall . nathaniel s torch flew from his hand , landing in the water and extinguishing . the gloom deepened as nathaniel picked himself up and launched at klaern . they tumbled into the water , klaern s torch meeting a similar end in the black water of the sewers . the darkness was pressing in . nathaniel and klaern vied for dominance over each other . newline newline  stop it ! stop it , now !  celaena screamed . she tried to pull nathaniel off klaern , but almost lost her footing . she glanced at her torch and stepped back . they could not afford for any more torches to give out . newline newline  take this , celaena ,  marcus said as he shoved his torch into her hand . he snatched at the two boys fighting in the muck . klaern began to hiss a spell .  no ! silence , boy , you will draw them here !  marcus had not spoken soon enough . the ancient words flew from his mouth and a heavy feeling came over the whole tunnel . nathaniel was lifted into the air and thrown down the tunnel into the water . he came up sputtering and angry . he stood to renew his assault , but a new sound stopped him . newline newline it was coming from the direction of artesia . it flowed liquid through the tunnels , there was no echoing , it did not bounce around the stone walls . it came from the darkness , appeared from the darkness and then evaporated seconds later , only to appear once again . whispers . hundreds and hundreds of whispering voices filled the chamber . klaern s face turned a shade of ghostly white as he realized what he had done . the umbrans were coming . they had felt the magic , heard the ancient words from up above , and now they were coming . he had killed them all . newline newline  go !  marcus roared and they were all in motion , fleeing down the tunnels in black terror . they splashed and stomped , fell and stumbled , picked each other up and set them on their feet . for all their efforts , the whispering only grew louder , and the shapes in the darkness behind them only grew more tangible and real . newline newline marcus lifted the map to his eyes , praying to all the gods in the land to secure his footing . if he slipped now , he would not get up again . by his reckoning , the group was nearing the exit of the tunnels . the umbrans could not survive in full daylight , could not coalesce into tangible form . artesia had been sacked in the night , and they had wandered through the sewers for hours on end . the sun must be up . if only they could reach the exit . newline newline  only a bit farther ! the exit is salvation . do not stop running !  marcus yelled through gasping breaths to his companions . newline newline  we ll never make it ! they re too fast . they ll catch us before we get to the exit !  celaena yelled back . newline newline  keep moving !  was the only reply marcus could think to give . he hazarded a glance back . he wished he had nt . there was no tunnel behind them . only darkness , allenveloping darkness . it was at the edge of their torchlight and gaining . farther back , marcus could make out the glint of witchfire , the fire of darkness , which consumed not just flesh and bone and skin and marrow , but the essence of a person . witchfire would burn your soul out of existence . marcus turned back , put his head down , and ran for his life . newline newline klaern was trailing , the edge of the darkness just inches behind him . he could feel it pulling at him , waiting to devour everything he was and everything he could have ever been . he was terrified , but he knew celaena was right , there was no way they could outpace the umbrans . but , if given just a small amount of delay , they could survive . they could make it into the light . klaern grit his teeth and set his jaw , brows furrowing . he began to speak . newline newline as soon as klaern began to speak the ancient tongue , words of power dripping like sweat from his body , the darkness sped up , egged on by the promise of magic to feast on . celaena glanced at klaern , her eyes widening . klaern simply shot her a look and nodded . the words he was speaking were powerful . the air grew heavy and thick with their magic . he would need a powerful spell to delay living darkness . the more words that spilled from him , the faster they came . with them , a glow began to emanate from klaern , glowing brighter and brighter the more complex the incantation became . newline newline until at last , when his glow was almost too bright to bear he turned towards the darkness and burst into flame . the flame did not come from inside him  it was not conjured around him . he was the flame . he shed his earthly body , and the flame of his soul erupted from him , becoming a wall of fire , a blockade of light to save his friends . the darkness screamed as the fire ate into it , the first wave of attackers vaporizing from the brightness . celaena glanced back a single time , as marcus turned a corner , to see her love s light devoured by the darkness behind them . tears ran down her cheeks . newline newline marcus saw light ahead and pressed himself harder and harder . he burst through the gloom onto an overhang on the side of a cliff . the light blinded him as he dodged to the side . he breathed deep , letting himself bask in the light . it was only once he had caught his breath , that he remembered that he had a group of friends with him . he turned around to find only two of them . nathaniel was collapsed on the solid rock , breathing hard . celaena leaned against the side of the cliff and looked up into the sun . newline newline  celaena , where  he began . newline newline  he was a single candle flame in a sea of darkness ,  celaena said . a sound of anguish ripped through her as she buried her face in her arms and slid to the floor . newline newlineonce a year comes the day when if you turn eighteen you are given a test . this test would decide on whether you would become a hero , villian , npc , or monster . my parents had belonged to the hero class and part of the sock monkey guild . mother had been a shieldmaiden , father is a shinobi . we lost mom a few months ago during the last troll war . they apparently pm d each other for months before i was born . newline newline i m going to be quite clear , my grades have never been what you would call good . in fact i thought i was going to bomb it and be sentenced as a monster . thing is if you become a monster , you are forever turned into it . your young would be human until they saw whether or not you too were worthy of it . newline newline for weeks before my dad has been grilling me and as i stood in line sandwiched between a guy who smelled extremely like troll , and my bff lori taylor my mind went blank . newline newline lori has been my bff since grade two when her family moved here . she saved me half a dozen times , she s also a wiz . i could hear her mutter over and over again . something to the affect of ,  the troll rebellion s last any where from 5 months to a year . three plus five is eight . the current king is quinten ...  newline newline the line eeks slowly , this year is a record turn out , even after the test is over we wo nt know how we did for a week when they post the results in the town square . i wonder to

blonde lady calls my name , in case you are wondering , i do nt know how my parents decided it or if i came with it . newline newline  here ,  i call out . i m then lead down to a dark chamber , there is a smallish man waiting for me . newline newline  everyone has magical capabilities , but for the most part they are small . once there was a race that was almost pure magic , but they have nt been seen in many generations . this is a test to see how much you have .  he took me over to a desk with a ping pong ball and a set of cups ,  all you have to do is move with your mind the ping pong ball through the series of cups with a blindfold on .  he placed the blindfold on . newline newline to tell you the truth , i could nt be sure of anything , although in my mind s eye i could see everything . the guy through the whole thing said ,  interesting ,  and  what a novel approach .  newline newline it did nt last long , and the same could be said for the next several tests . once outside i found lori , and the two of us walked home .  i found that first test to be so weird did nt you ?  she had to ask me a few times .  i said , did nt you .  newline newline  yes , it was so odd ,  i agreed with her . newline newline she left me at my house and went home from there . my dad was no where to be found , big shock , he spends more time at the guild hall than half the guildmasters . i hung my purse up and went to work on dinner . newline newline the week slowly passed and finally a poster appeared in town . me and lori ran all the way . it took only a minute to find her name , lori

lori . newline newline  freya , this means your a wizard , this class has nt been seen for over a 1,000 years . there is nt anyone who s even capable of teaching you .  newline newline  i guess that means all the best guilds are going to be after me . arthur lay atrophied in his vertical 2 by 7 pod , cords and wires etched into his brain . next to him , lay thousands of identical pods , a majority with the word  deceased  written in flashing red letters . arthur  s pod lacked the red letters signifying death , although his body was indistinguishable from a rotting corpse . motionless and alone , his heart raced with excitement . newline  newline arthur and beth lay together on the beach , the warm sun caressing their young bodies almost as gently as they caressed each other  s . with their foreheads together , arthur stared into beth  s light brown eyes and marveled at her beauty . even after all their years together it was amazing how she still made his heart flutter like a nervous little boy . newline newline newline  okay , this is boring ,  beth exclaimed in her soft and sweet voice as she rolled on her back ,  want to do something else ?  newline  not really . i for one , enjoy cuddling.  arthur replied matter of factly .  unlike some people i know.  newline newline  yeah well that  s just because you  re a big softie . i need to toughen you up , and i know just the way.  beth said , raising her hand and swiping away the beach . briefly the two existed in empty white space until the new environment loaded . it was an abandoned space vessel , lit dimly by flickering lights . arthur could make out the gnarled moans of dying space marines along with the cries of alien scum . newline newline  oh no , not this again  arthur said , knowing beth meant to humiliate him in a game alien vs marine . newline newline  what , are you scared ? we  ve played this so many times . how could you be scared ?  newline newline beth and arthur found themselves in a room loaded with various pistols , grenades , assault rifles , and other essential alien killing tools . arthur went for the shotgun , since it was the easiest to hit something with and his aim was awful . beth , however , went for the pistol . she knew she didn  t need to bother taking a bigger gun . newline newline  what , that  s all your using ? you big showoff !  arthur said . newline newline  yep . and i bet i  ll kill more than you too.  beth cried as she kicked open a door and blasted an aliens head clean off . newline newline arthur had played this game many times , but today he felt an unusual sense of foreboding . normally fighting realistic looking aliens that are trying to murder you with acid saliva is scary , but today was different . all day they had been hearing a synthetic voice countdown . what it was counting down to , was anybody  s guess . newline newline  five minutes in virtual reality remaining.  the synthetic woman  s voice echoed . newline newline  hey beth.  arthur said over gunfire ,  what do you suppose that timer means ? have you heard that before ?  newline newline  yeah got one !  beth said , dusting another alien ,  umm , no idea what the timer means , but apparently we have ten minutes.  newline newline  well , i guess we had better enjoy  before arthur could finish an alien blasted acid on his face ending his alien fighting career . newline newline  newline arthur  s pod opened in a puff of dank haze , ejecting his frail body onto the cold concrete floor . he looked around frantically while taking in his surroundings . thousands of what looked like corpses lined the massive room , each in their own pod . a few of those bodies were moving although most remained perfectly still . had he been transported into a new zombie game ? no . this is no game . his face , wrinkled with age , wrinkled even further in confusion . where was he ? more importantly , where is beth ? newline newline arthur tried calling out but his voice sounded like gravel from years of disuse . newline  beth  he eventually managed .  beth , where are you.  newline newline it was no use . beth isn  t here . instead , arthur tried to get information from some of the few people who were alive , or reanimated , if that was the case . unfortunately , they were as clueless as he was . all anyone remembered was simply being transported here from their previous lives . all arthur knew was he needed to get out of here and find beth , so they can return home . newline newline arthur marched with the other survivors toward the only door in the building . people were just outside the door  he could hear them talking . maybe beth was with them ! arthur limped as fast as he could toward the flashing red exit sign , shoving and pushing to get there first . he pushed open the door and was blinded by white light . newline newline slowly , he regained his vision , but god did he wish he hadn  t . the sky was not blue but ash grey . there was more rubble than buildings and not a plant to be seen . and the people that greeted him outside wore little more than rags and were nearly as skinny as he was . but they had guns . guns pointing directly at arthur and the other survivors . newline newline arthur scanned the crowd gathered before him for beth but could not find her . please let me find beth he prayed . please don  t let me be alone here . tears were forming in his eyes as the hope drained from his heart . but then he heard an angelic sound . newline newline  arthur.  the voice was soft and sweet . it was beth  s . newline newline arthur  s flicked his eyes toward the voice . he saw beth  s eyes , but they belonged to an old woman . what happened ? why is she so old ? newline newline  arthur ,  beth repeated .  i  m glad you are alive . i wasn  t sure you would make it.  she said with a thin smile curling along her lips .  now i get to kill you myself .  newline newline  beth , what are you saying ? we need to go back home . let  s go back to the beach , how  s that sound ? finish our cuddling . or we can shoot aliens if you want . whatever you want . just stop scaring me . this isn  t funny.  newline newline  oh yes it us arthur . you pathetic little weasel . you dreamed of me in you little virtual reality life didn  t you . the gall . you abandon me , the real me , to live with a virtual representation of

, while you smiled in your dreams . for that you will pay.  newline newline arthur remembered now . he and beth . they had a daughter together . did he really abandon his family ? arthur dug through his memory and found an answer . yes . he was scared of the war and the draft . and he was addicted to the virtual reality . in a way , abandoning his family wasn  t even a choice , just a survival mechanism . a stupid , selfish , survival mechanism newline newline  you abandoned us , arthur . your own wife and child you left behind as soon as the world began to turn to shit . our family had one spot in that damned virtual life . we agreed to let our daughter sam have it . do you remember ? remember how you stole it for yourself like a coward . the others had loved ones still in the digital world so they maintained it until now . i have always wanted to kill but couldn  t open the damn pod until the time was up . and guess what ? times up.  newlinei  m a 40 year old male from kentucky , and i ve been writing poetry  bad  and stories  much better  since i was 15 . newline newline when i first started writing it was on index cards , hand written in about 6pt font equivalent . bad poetry about sleep deprivation and death . typical teen angsty stuff . newline newline then we got a packard bell pentium 60 mhz . it was a sad , pathetic machine that blew my mind , and i wrote using whatever word processor we had at the time . over the years i ve used ms word , openoffice , ywrite , notepad , and most recently google docs . newline newline google docs work well for me because it s so easy to pop open a browser and just write , regardless of where . and i know i wo nt lose crap . newline newline i write because i ca nt stop . i tried giving it up a while . i always end up coming back . there are some very specific stories i want to tell , and i need to write them . newline newline recently i finished my first full book , and it s about 160k words  i will probably end up splitting it to two books because of the size  , and that took me about two years  little under , actually  , but there would be months at a time when i did nt write anything . when i am typing , i go fast  aesop s fables test says adjusted to 48 , but that s low for me . i do make mistakes , but i make fewer when writing from my head rather than copying . newline newline one day i ll start promoting my work , but for now , i m doing work to allow the book to be split into two . newline newline as a plug for that story , here s a synopsis : newline newline nearly two thousand years in the future , humanity has spread among the stars . we sent out hundreds , maybe thousands of colony ships , most of which were lost to our records even before the awakening  an apocalypse . the awakening destroyed existing governments , existing continents , and brought with it war , famine , disease , loss of infrastructure , and general chaos . and magic . then from the ashes , rose a new civilization based on a marriage of magic and technology . it has been almost a thousand years since the arcanum , a new multistar spanning empire now , was founded . in that time , humanity has remained convinced that we are alone in the universe . newline newline carr , a seasoned adept for the arcanum operations  arcops  military branch , is on a routine scouting mission when he and his navigator run into an impossibility  a forty kilometer wedgeshaped ship . clearly alien , clearly impossible . from there , everything carr thought he knew about the arcanum , magic , and the universe is challenged . newline newline    newline newline the story is technical in it s handling of magic  there are strong rules , and there are a lot of things it cant do . but it can do a lot . carr is a prodigy with personal issues , nav is brilliant at his job , but utterly without ambition . and this does nt even touch on the other half of the story : a lost human colony is seeking it s homeworld and runs into it s own problems . eventually all collide . newline newlineinterviewer : and the time he held that woman by her ankles at the top of the skyscraper ? newline newline mayor : that ? oh , that was a misunderstanding . he wanted to help the young lady get the change out of her pockets . newline newline interviewer :  and kill a couple of people by throwing objects down along the way , i guess . newline newline mayor : i m afraid you ve lost me there , sorry . newline newline interviewer : nevermind .   looks at his notes   anyway , if i recall correctly  and this closeup an eyewitness shot might imply so  the woman was wearing a skirt . newline newline mayor : some skirts do have pockets . newline newline interviewer , sighs : okay . i ll give you that . but why on earth did he have to fly with her to the top of a 83storybuilding ? newline newline mayor : it is scientifically proven that ... that the effect of gravity increases with height . yes . newline newline interviewer : those pockets must have been awfully tight , then . newline newline mayor : probably . coffee ? newline newline interviewer : what ? newline newline mayor : would you like a coffee ? newline newline mayor reaches for a coffee pot with trembling hands .  newline newline interviewer : i do nt think so , no . newline newline mayor , stands up and walks over to closet : oh , we do have a variety of other drinks as well . like our collection of excellent local wines . just last year , i had the pleasure to taste a great newline newline interviewer : are you trying to change the subject ? newline newline mayor : now , young man , i do nt mean to sound condescending , but there s a lot more to this whole business than what is at the surface . you still have a lot to learn . newline newline interviewer : let s go a little deeper , then . what about mr magneto s threat to destroy the city center with a giant laser from orbit ? was that a misunderstanding as well ? newline newline mayor , taking a seat again : indeed . while it may certainly sound shocking at first glance , his intention was not the destruction of our city per se as much as criticising the state of its architecture . and in that regard , i do have to agree with him . lots of exposed concrete from the seventies . really , who builds like that today ? newline newline interviewer : are we talking about a super hero or a struggling artist ? newline newline mayor : art , my young friend , is in the eye of the beholder . there is a lot more to many things than the untrained eye can see . newline newline interviewer : i do nt understand how that is connected to anything . newline newline mayor : ah well , everything is connected to everything , after all . was nt it heraclitus who said  you can not escape the same prison twice  ? newline newline interviewer : ... newline newline mayor : or maybe not . are you sure you do nt want a cup of coffee ? newline newline interviewer : i think we re done here . thank you for your time , mayor . newline newline   interviewer stands up , extends his hand   newline newline   mayor stands up , grips interviewer s hand with both of his .   newline newline mayor : oh , it was a pleasure . please do not hesitate to contact us again in case you need ... help ?  locks eyes with interviewer  newline newline interviewer : okay ... i guess . goodbye mayor . newline newline mayor : goodbye , my friend .  smiles forcedly  newline newline the interviewer left the room , and looked at the scrap of paper the mayor had slipped into his hand . four letters were scrawled across it hastily : h e l p. suddenly , things made a lot more sense .no . newline newline no , no , no . fuck . newline newline i didn  t even see it . i thought i could smell something rotten but when can  t you these days ? my arm suddenly felt tight and i looked down and there was some mouldy old bitch with her teeth sunk into my wrist . then the pain hit me like a smack in the face . my body and my mind were working independently by now . i completely forgot about the hatchet in my other hand , but still my arm swung down and stuck it right through her neck . that told her . newline newline i just stared . this can  t be real . the bite was bad  the blood was already streaming out . more than anything , i was just so fucking angry . the infected girl was still gurgling in her throat , pawing helplessly at the hatchet . i crushed her head with the heel of my boot . and again . and again . then i used my fists , hammering and hammering , screaming into the air like a wild animal . i guess kate must have heard me because before i knew it she was at my shoulders pulling me back . she told me it was okay , that it was over . she didn  t know the half of it . i managed to pull my sleeve down over my wrist just in time . she didn  t see . she can  t have seen , she would have said something . i feel like i know her well enough to know she wouldn  t have let me carry on like that . the rest of the group were still in the main hall of the school . we walked in and dylan was the first to turn his rage to me . he shoved me hard against the door , shouted at me to never do anything stupid again . don  t worry , i won  t . i saw the fire shrink back behind his eyes and he asked me , calmer now , if i was alright . all i could do was nod . i looked over all the huge , tired eyes of my group  no , my friends  and i couldn  t do it . i couldn  t tell them . for the whole of my life , i  d been breezing through . i ride on the back of better people and call it my success , and i was done . i was just fucking done with everything . trust me to learn now as i  m finally dying , that every second is precious . and truthfully , i didn  t trust dylan to respect my wishes right now : if i told them about the bite , dylan would shake his head in disappointment and gun me down there and then . because it  s the right thing to do . but i  ve never done the right thing in my life and i guess i  m greedy . i wanted as long as i could have . so i kept my mouth shut as we left the high school and got back in the truck . i held my arm just a little closer to my body and tried to hide the tears on my cheek . newline newline kate , if you find this , i want you to know that i  m not sorry about what happened to peter . i know you blame me for it and you should , but i  m not sorry . dylan , you were right to be careful with me . it was only a matter of time , right ? jack , you need to look after lara as best you can . you  ve no idea how rare it is to be as close to someone as you are in times like these . don  t let that go . and ali , everything is going to be fine . you  re the cutest little badass i  ve ever met . you stay close to these guys and never be ashamed to run . things can get scary and that  s okay because that means you  re alive , and with things the way they are that  s as much as you can ask for . newline newline everything we read about the virus is true . i  m so fucking cold . i  m sweating more than i did when we raided that chapel in san francisco . that was a good day . my arm feels like it  s made of lead . my eyes won  t stay open . i don  t know how much i can stand to write . my heart feels like it  s going to rip out between my ribs . i think there  s still time to end this my way . i just don  t know if i have the courage . i couldn  t even bring myself to cut my arm off  i  m not exactly a doctor , but i thought that could have helped , maybe ? stop the infection ? stupid , i know . i just couldn  t do it . i  m weak . you all know that by now . i was never going to make it . but you guys can . you will . you  re all good people , maybe the last good people . use me as example of who not to be , at least maybe then you  ll still remember me . newline newline thanks guys newline newline dont be aloneso here i am . aged seventeen and on the brink of turning the crazy age of eighteen . everyone is super excited about it , cept me of course . i m mostly scared as to what s going to happen next . newline newline no one has ever had eyes like mine . beautiful blues , vibrant reds , earthy browns ... but mine are black . and i m not talking darkbrownlookslikeblack . no . you look at my eyes and they seem devoid of colour . you ca nt see your reflection in my eyes like you can in others . it freaks most people out when they first see it . newline newline when i turn eighteen i do nt know what to expect . will some sort of amazing power well up inside me and go out of control ? or will i get nothing out of this ? newline newline no one knows . newline newline i ve got five minutes to prepare myself for whatever comes next and i m nervous as all hell . i keep checking the clock , along with my family . they re all offering calming words , phrases of encouragement . it does nt help all that much to calm me down what with the mass media presence right outside the window . it ll be a juicy story , i m sure . newline newline my parents , both blueeyes , had erected a strong telekinetic barrier with their powers to help keep them out . i knew as soon as the clock struck 12:52 pm that barrier would break . need to get that story , you know ? newline newline thirty seconds now . i take a deep breath and let it out in a long , controlled sigh . newline newline ten seconds . my palms and forehead are starting to get clammy . i hope nothing goes awry . newline newline time s up . newline newline i feel no different . nothing clicked . nothing welled up inside me , nothing burst out . it was kind of underwhelming . newline newline i held my hands out in front of myself , palms up . nothing was happening . i willed anything to happen . newline newline the media burst through the door  the barrier was down . i was bombarded with questions that i could nt answer . microphones shoved in my face . through all the confusion of that moment i could hear my parents behind me trying to force the people out of our home .  it s not working ,  my dad said . newline newline their normally strong barrier was nt materializing . so i tried . what s the harm , right ? newline newline a crack like a lightning strike rang out , blowing all of the reporters to the floor . a barrier materialized in front of me with such magnitude that it cut the air , producing a sonic boom . some of the reporters , enraged that they had been unceremoniously blown off their feet aimed their abilities at me . newline newline some fire balls , some telekinetic pushes . someone even used a lightning ability . i watched as their retaliation fizzled out inches from me . that s when i felt the surge . again i held my hand out , envisioning that barrier as before . except this time it was nt a barrier . it was a massive projectile of fire and lightning encased in a telekinetic bubble . newline newline so that was it . any powers used around me were negated and absorbed . i ceased my projectile and uttered one word .  leave .  my eyes flashed through all the established colours before settling back to black . everyone ran . a smile flashed across my face . newline newline this could prove to be really interesting . derivin had been in that cave for centuries . protected by its magic , bound by its spirit . it needed him far more than the riches it protected . to think that opening a book and reading the inscription  memento quis sis mundus  can leave you in a trance , preserve you and destroy everything else you ever knew . with the utter of  finis  the glow from the book subsided . derivin fell to his knees and collapsed . newline newline the next day newline newline waking up in a bed unlike his own , derivin tried to get up and realized he was restrained . to his surprise when he tried to scream , he could not speak . newline newline  yes , a spell like that can leave someone a little mute  , said a voice from the corner of the room . newline  firstly , i would like to thank you for bringing me back ! i must say , you were nt what i expected but you worked well enough .  newline newline derivin was awestruck . what exactly has happened he thought . newline newline  well first of all you read you the book and yes , i can hear your thoughts.there is a lot that you can do now because of me . speaking just wo nt be one of them . think of it as a security deposit . my security .  newline newline  and why did you chain me down ?  , he thought . newline newline  because i need you to listen , do you have any idea as to what book you read or who i am ?  newline newline  look i just came in here looking to keep dry from the rain , now i am mute , talking to some shadow as calm as a person chained down can be  newline newline  oh this ? , its all a mirage if it makes you feel better ...  and with a wave of his hands , derivin s chains dissolved as well as the walls around him and he was back in the cave . newline newline  now if you would let me explain , my name is solomon maybe you have heard of me and that book over there , was a seal . a seal to protect this world from magic , well from me to be exact and seeing as you were able to find this cave and read from the book , you must be magic too .  newline newline  so..what i did was bad ?  newline newline  well ... yes and no ... good for me , bad for you  newline newline  why is that ?  newline newline you brought magic back to this world , safeguards were put in place and now it is going to be your job to help me remove them to restore me to my former glory , welcome to the dawn of a new era ! newline newline  end ... .for now  newline newline newline newline i ll meet you for coffee at our favorite cafe ,  donna choked her words out through smoke damaged lungs , to her sister katie , who checked her her phone again . newline newline  yeah , i ll tell mom and dad you died . see ya ,  katie said as she placed her hand on her sister s burnedtoacrisp arm and turned to leave . katie had seen donna die at least five times this year , and it was becoming a serious inconvenience . katie had been called every time to identify the body or possibly speak to donna before she died . it was always the same though , make sure her plants got watered , the cat got fed , and to meet at their cafe for coffee later . it was hard for katie to keep her eyes from rolling when she heard donna had slept with a cigarette and lit herself on fire . newline newline on her way home from the dead body collection point , katie walked past ed the jumper . on the last saturday of the month at approximately 6pm , ed jumps from the highest bridge in katie s town , falling face first into concrete . katie once asked him why he did it and he explained that it was just time for him to be dead , like the old days , when people died forever . so he kept himself dead as much as possible by immediately killing himself when he was reborn . over the years katie noticed that while ed s body repaired itself and looked to be functioning properly , he had become paler and more obsessed with being in his death state . maybe the state of constant death was bad for ed s mind . but katie did nt dwell on that thought too much longer that , since ed would be dead in two minutes anyways . newline newline katie almost made it all the way home , until she remembered donna s cat needed to be fed , those creatures died permanently if not cared for katie remembered as she took a left down an ally next to her home . newline newline  to die or not to die ! this is your choice !  a man yelled from a street corner as he waved fliers in katie s direction . he shoved a pamphlet into her hands before she could object . the man walked quickly down the street with more pamphlets after a group of unsuspecting pedestrians . katie was familiar people like him , the  cryonappers ,  a slang term for people who freeze themselves in a death like state for an extended period of time in hopes that death will be permanent again when they awake . katie tossed the flier , she was pretty sure no one was working on a cure for their semiperminent death state . why would they ? death was the ultimate disease . it was cured . there was no undoing it , only living with it . newline newline katie made it to donna s apartment and stopped to text her parents : newline newline  donna died again . i plan to as well . check on cat and plant for d. see ya later .  newline newline katie walked to the nearest busy road , the one that ran across the bridge that ed liked to jump from and waited for the next slew of traffic . katie did nt have to wait long before a few semitrucks started to rumble up the incline of the bridge towards her . katie was bored and quite frankly did not want to deal with anything for the next month , especially if that meant taking care of donna s stuff until she returned . why was she always staying while donna got a break from life ? as a red and white semitruck approached , katie left the safety of the curb to position herself in front of it s path too soon for it to stop or even brake . before the light left katie s eyes she silently prayed it would never return . newline newline newlinefreedom . it s overrated , let me tell ya . we fought him for a thousand years , all across the world . the dark one . the bringer of doom . the big kahuna . we were so naive . newline newline you might think i ve been brainwashed . maybe i have . i lead everyone against him , and now i stand by his side as his most trusted advisor . his legions would overpower us one day , we knew they would . but we refused to give up the fight . i remember the last battle very well . on the golden fields of avalok , 5 miles up the river regar from the golden city  the last bastion of the light . that day i stood in front of the 10 thousand of us left willing to fight , the rest had been enslaved  , and i said  today , we may die . but , we die as free folk .  newline newline never been more wrong in my life . we lost that battle with only a tenth of our forces dead . the rest taken as prisoners . we had heard horror stories of the torturous methods of his dark minions . how they would rip the nails from their enemies fingers and stick them in their eyes . i remember taking a poison arrow in the shoulder and passing out . i did nt die . i was knocked out . newline newline i woke up on a table in the golden city , with an orc looking over me , nursing my wounds . i was chained down , of course . they could nt trust me . i had been the leader of the order of light for the past 600 years and i had lead the charges in all of our battles . all of our victories and our losses . the day i drank from the fountain and gained immortality , i took a vow to stop him from taking that which he sought  total domination . i had never even met my enemy , i had just been raised knowing he should be destroyed . now that s brainwashing for you . newline newline fast forward a few weeks and i m all healed up , and i m being walked up to his chambers in the heart of the dark fortress at ungoltugra . i was expecting to be thrown before a dark throne in a large hall where i would be laughed at by his captains . the pathetic knight who thought she could save the world . instead , they unlocked my shackles and walked me out into a small garden . they left me to walk around , and then i found him . watering a lily . newline newline now , 50 years down the line and i ca nt imagine things being better . the lord s first action was to eradicate the plague spreading through the lands . a plague that we believed he released upon the earth . he did nt . it came from a particularly gruesome clan of lizard folk in the northern marshes . the first task he gave me was to deal with them myself . i executed and burned every single one of them and within a couple of months , the plague was gone . newline newline then the repairs began . in a matter of weeks , his orcs had repaired almost all of the damage to our cities , and his generals were placed in charge to oversee the process and maintain order . and they did . better than we ever could . there was no violence . fear kept the people in check at first , and eventually , that fear turned to trust , and to love . he saved us from everything . the order of light was even immortalised with a large memorial at gurdan , the city where the order was founded . the official line ?  we remember those who fought for their beliefs , even when those beliefs are wrong .  newline newline now , i am general sophie drakeheart . ruthless warrior , tactless diplomat , advisor to our great lord . freedom . it s overrated . on october 22 , 2044 , louis irvin died at age 85 . i remember visiting him once before he passed , and he told me that he  wished he could have just one more year .  the cruel thing was that he only would have needed a day on october 23 , 2044 , google x released the foyac : the fountain of youth age cure . that was three hundred years ago , and to this day , i maintain that louis was the luckiest man on earth . newline newline within three hours of releasing the foyac , google became the wealthiest company in history , and they did nt stop gaining that wealth . investors wept with joy as their stocks shot higher than babel . within a year , google had merged with spacex , and after a decade , they had created a second earth on mars . and everyone with half a brain , myself included , moved there to avoid the storm which had been awoken on the planet we used to hold so dear . newline newline there is something terribly sinister about humanity . we harbor thoughts and ideas and beliefs , none of which seem harmful on the surface . but when given the right trigger , these concepts can take forms which the darkest depths of our conscious imagination can not begin to fathom . eternal life ! it is the greatest dream of mankind , of course ! it is the key to meaning in life  to have an eternity with which to see the fruits of your actions . but for many , meaning is derived from forms other than that which they do or say . newline newline september 11 , 2101 . that was the day upon which the world ended . enraged by this new technology , the primitive world had risen up and created a weapon so terrible that nothing under the rainclouds could withstand it . on 9112101 , the church of scientology released a toxin into the sky which poisoned the rainclouds  filled them with cyanide . within a year , every human who failed to escape was dead . newline newline mars is nt so bad , but it s not like home . everything here is the same  red , red , more red . some have tried to truly terraform it , but i fear that by the time that is done , we will have moved from humanity . whether this shall be a step forward or back i can not say . perhaps we shall remain here , stagnant as rocks . perhaps some will reproduce , and their progeny shall surpass us and destroy us all . perhaps we will kill each other off , either by war or by mere overpopulation . i wo nt be around to know . newline newline tell elizabeth i loved her  newline newline robert k. cormac  october 22 , 2344  newline newline found in apartment of cormac , robert 082244 newline newline cadaver was found hanging by neck from ceiling . efforts of resuscitation proved futile . newline newline time of death estimated to be 2:00 am .freddie wondered if the world he was living in was real or just someones sick fantasy . he felt trapped , almost as if he was caught in a something big and he found no way out of this twisted reality . newline newline suddenly he opened his eyes , and saw the glazing night sky . he had fallen asleep on the mountain next to his home village . he touched his pockets , but the only thing he found was a nickle and some rubber bands . he felt the wind breeze through the air , it slightly stroked freddie s back as he was strolling down the mountain . he wanted to head home , because it was getting dark and he did nt want his mother to worry . newline newline when freddie reached the front door of his house he knew , that something was off . the door was unlocked which was very odd , because he knew that he had locked the door when he had left . as he walked in , he saw a gun on the kitchen table and his mother lying down on the floor . he stormed to her , but she was nt conscious . there was some noise in the back of the house , freddie took the gun and went to check it out . he entered his own room , only to find a stranger digging through his drawers , looking for something valuable . the man did nt spot freddie and just minded his own business . freddie slowly walked behind the man pointing the gun at him . freddie yelled and the man turned around sharply , which startled freddie and he fired . freddie had just killed a man . he went back to see how his mom was doing . she started waking up slowly and freddie just bursted into tears , with the bloody gun still in his hand . he kept saying that he did nt mean to do it and begged her mom not to cry . freddie s mom took him into her arms and just held him . that was the moment when freddie realised : nothing really matters .roger that moretta , over and out .  fred put down his radio and checked his roster . according to his log the croatian container ship was the last ship that would come in tonight . the closest thing he would have to supervise was the departure of the ss anne at 7:30 in the morning . fred grabbed his magazine and settled down comfy in his chair . he d read a bunch in his magazine then try to sneak in a couple hours of sleep before he supervised the departure of the anne . graveyard shift was always a slow job , not much going on . nice a quiet . precisely what fred wanted . he was getting paid double for working the night shift , but he mostly spent his time reading or sleeping . it was a win win basically . newline newline newline fred was halfway through an article on wooden doors when one of the monitors near him started to beep . goddammit what is it now ?  he grumbled . to be honest he was almost dozing off and now this thing made him wide awake again . a green flashing light indicated the radar had picked up something .  please dont be another dead guy ,  he thought to himself . a few months ago the exact same thing had happened and it had turned out to be a dead guy floating in the bay . well , most of a dead guy anyways . he had to stay all night , telling what happened to four different cops  i was sitting there then the radar started to bleep , checked it out , saw it was a dead guy and called you guys   and then had to fill in a bunch of forms and stuff . all that for some dead guy . newline newline newline he eyed the radar and his eyes widened . this wasnt a dead guy . this thing was huge . couldnt be a boat though , didnt have a radio transponder or beacon or anything . still , the radio was worth a shot .  erhm ... this is new york harbor to incoming vessel , please identify yourself . you have no permission to enter the bay or dock here , please identify yourself . this is new york harbor , please identif ...  suddenly he was interrupted by the loud sound of a foghorn blowing through the night sky . what the hell ?  fred dropped the radio and went outside of his shack to look at what was in the bay . no chance of this being a floating island of plastic . floating garbage doesnt have a foghorn . newline newline newline he looked outside and he could not have been prepared for what he saw . he had to think back to make sure he hadnt been using any kind of drugs but he was sure he was clean . he hadnt dared to smoke pot on the job ever since his boss almost caught him that one time . what he saw was incredible . a giant steamliner ship was slowly passing by him . it was like a floating apartment block passing by . newline newline and yet there was no radio or transponder or pretty much anything that pointed to this being a ship . looked pretty old to . three giant chimneys puffing out smoke . fancy barricades and windows and everything . this looked like a luxury cruiseship . but there wasnt supposed to be any more ships coming in tonight . if she follows basic ship rules her name should be painted on the bow somewhere , he thought . the ship was now halfway past him , so he had to run a while untill he reached the front untill he could read the name . newline newline no fucking way ,  he said . he pulled out his phone and called his boss . th ephone rang for quite a while untill his tired sounding boss picked up . fred , what is it ? this better not be another sighting of that white whale you claimed to see a few months ago .  yeah so uhm theres this ship that came in that was not in the log anywhere .  and ? just tell them they cant dock unless they re approved and once they got the needed paperwork they ll have to wait untill we give them a designated time .  yeah well uh the thing is this ship doesnt have a radio . theres no way for me to speak to the captain . besides its kinda supposed to be..at the bottom of the ocean . boss what i m saying is : the titanic just sailed into our motherfucking bay .  thats it fred first thing tomorrow i m having you take a drug test and i swear if it turns out to be positive then ...  newline newline newline but freds never learned what would happen to him since his boss was interrupted by the foghorn going again . what the hell was that fred ?  well sir that would be the foghorn of the titanic . if i remember naval history correct its to celebrate a safe arrival sir .  ok so fred i m going to come check it out , just stay there .  newline of course i ll stay here where else would i go , idiot , muttered fred to himself . newline newline newline half an hour later his boss arrived and the two men stood on the docks , gaping at the ship . holy crap it really is ...  i told you .  yeah but i didnt expect it to be really..  they could see figures appear on deck . who are they ? what are they doing ?  like i have all the answers here , fred thought . well they appear to be preparing to dock the ship , boss . they stood watching another five minutes untill freds boss started calling his bosses . and they didnt believe it either , untill he convinced them to come take a look . and then they called their bosses , and so on . newline newline soon a small crowd had gathered on the docks , all watching the titanic dock in new york harbor . and then the ship started unloading . planks were dropped and people started flocking off the ship . except it they were nt really people . more like..ghosts or something . they walked and chatted like people but they wouldnt respond to anything the people on the docks said . in fact they walked straight through a part of the crowd . this was some really strange stuff . fred tried speaking to someone in a sailors outfit but the man didnt appear to hear him . he saw someone with a captains outfit walk off and overheard him talk to a sailor :  bit late on schedule , but better late than never i suppose !  and they both bursted out into laughter . newline newline newline so ... does anybody have an idea to what we do about this ?  someone asked . well actually i might have an idea . my cousin had some problems with his old grandma s house , something about it being haunted by ghosts or something .  hah , ghosts , only idiots believe in that ,  a man snorted . well my friend , how would you describe that ,  said another , pointing at the docked titanic and the crowd disembarking off it . the first guy didnt reply . as i was saying , my cousin had some problems with ghosts , and he called some guys to get rid of them . like exterminators , but for ghosts instead of for bugs . told me they got rid of the problem in no time . want me to give him a call and ask for their number ?  newline newline newline the men looked around and nodded . it wouldnt hurt to call some guys who might knew a thing or two about ghosts . it wasnt like anyone else knew someone with an expertise on ghosts . fred dialed in the number and waited for the call to connect . what was their slogan again ? newline newline something like when theres something strange in your neighborhood , who you gon na call ? ghostbusters !  well this was something strange in the neighborhood allright ... 44634 upvotes ? what could possibly be this deserving in askreddit ?  the whole scenario took me by surprise and upon opening the thread i was damn certain it was just another legendary reddit day that would be talked about for a few months . but the comments seemed so.. genuine . newline  ok , i am really starting to freak out , why the fuck ca nt i get out of my room ?  deadpool was writing comments and replying to almost every suggestion i could see in the thread . newline i stood up and walked over to my wooden door covered in white pain and took the brass handle in my hand . something about the thread i was reading through made me feel so uneasy and i just could nt shake it until i knew that my door was open and i had a way out . newline i twisted my hand to turn the handle but it stayed in place . i tried harder a second time but the damn thing was not budging , as though frozen in time . newline  what the fuck ?  i muttered under my breath as i began to use more strength from both my arms this time but again the door appeared unmovable . newline a cold sweat began to sink in as the comments i had just read repeated through my head . suddenly this thread that i took so lightly became very real to me and i darted towards the window to confirm my fears . the moon shined through from the dark sky , i had never felt so far from it as i had when i began pounding on the window for help and desperately fighting with its own brass handle . this window was not about to move either . newline this had to be a local event , surely it must be relates with the recent cold weather we were hit by ? reddit seemed to have more knowledge and experience with this phenomenon than i did , it was a beacon of hope that i sorely needed as claustrophobia began to set in . newline lebanon , bruges , london , new york , even fucking outback australia was being effected by this bizarre affair . none of it made any sense to me . newline  listen everyone , there has to be something that connects us , something we are missing . i want everyone to post details about themselves  jobs , locations , names , age , everything ! there must be a link , this ca nt be random  . the comment was flooded with replies of people eagerly sharing their full personal information and life stories , far more information than anyone should ever share on the internet . newline  i m adam , i live in manchester uk , i am a chef , i like video games . wtf am i supposed to say ? i got a vaccination last week for a holiday coming up ? i ate nandos last night ? my mothers name is julia ? what could you possibly need to know ?  newline  well i got a shot last week too , so there is that i guess  . newline the replies began to rack up . newline  omg . so did i . for malaria right ?  newline  was that a malaria jab ?  newline  no fucking way did we all get the same jab  . newline the results were undeniable and my heart began to pound . a burning sensation began to take over my deltoid muscle as the clear realisation hit me that i too had a malaria vaccination last week . a drop of cold sweat ran down the back of my neck and i suddenly began to feel very faint as i started to realise just how very real this scenario was . the worst part was knowing that it was nt some mistake , i had gotten that jab and i had ended up with the same fate as the rest of them . newline  fuck this , fuck all of this , i am getting my sword off the wall and i am cutting through that fucking door  . deadpool had lost his cool and i began clicking the refresh button frantically for the next 5 minutes , desperate for news and some glimmer of hope . but what i got instead was something much worse . newline deadpool had given us his update ...  guys , there is a metal wall behind my door . i cut through and just hit pure metal . i ran to the window and called for help and it dawned on me . no one is here . no one is outside . i ca nt see or hear a single person . it s like someone locked me up and threw away the key  . newline before i could even get up to check the repiles had already flooded through ... newline  holy shit same here  . newline  where the fuck is everyone ? !  newline  how did we miss this ? where are my family ? why is no one in the street ?  newline  i live in central fucking london . not a single noise outside . no cars . no people . just silence  . newline i backed away from my screen , suddenly the artificial light had made me feel extremely nauseas . i unloaded the contents of my stomach into the desk bin on the floor . newline as i pulled myself together i peered through the window to see the same scenario . pure silence with not a single soul in sight . newline newline newline if you guys have enjoyed this then i will write part 2 tomorrow . mr . larson . mr. larson ! what are you doing mr . larson ? ! you can  t be doing that here !  samantha , larry larson  s landlady , scolded . newline newline larry larson looked up with watery , broken eyes . he wore some disheveled business attire . he was sitting on the front steps of his seedy , worn down apartment building . a bird , dead , lay across his lap  the skull open , the pink brains exposed to the world , to the clean air of human eyes . newline newline  mr . larson , we  ve been over this before . i accept you for your condition , but that doesn  t mean you can be doing stuff like that in public . i even put up a sign to remind you.  samantha continued , pointing to a sign next to the front door . newline newline larry turned his head slowly . green , decaying skin flaking off of his mortified flesh . he saw the sign , outlawing loitering , on the front porch . in parenthesis were the words  that means you larry.  . mr. larson looked down at the dead bird in his lap . he gave a few soft grunts , and took hold of the bird . with an awkward flail , he threw the bird off into the nearby bushes . samantha folded her arms , and nodded in approval . newline newline  that  s a good boy . gawd , the things i put up with in this city.  she muttered to herself , turning to go walk down the crowded city street . she was headed for the nearby subway terminal . newline newline larry larson sat on the porch , sad and lonely , watching his landlady waltz down the street . larry sat on the stoop , eyes bleary and sad , mouth downturned in a frown . he groaned quietly to himself . he  d been fired form his office job last week and couldn  t afford a proper meal . he subsisted on rats and birds and mice and pigeons . he was thinking about breaking into a morgue for a quality meal , but the idea of food past its due date wasn  t too appealing . newline newline with a sad grunt , larry leveraged himself off the stoop . it took a couple of seconds , but soon he was standing , in his worn shoes , on the sidewalk . he started to shamble down the street , heading nowhere in particular . newline newline gasps of surprise , of disgust and intrigue , used followed larry around back in his hometown . luckily , this was new york city . no one paid any attention the disgusting , rotting corpse of a man in this city of filth and business and work and drugs and pleasure and trash . larry larson had moved to the city several months ago hoping to escape his horrid condition . unfortunately , nothing much had changed . he was still sad , still lonely , still hungry , still depressed . newline newline larry wandered down the streets . he would let out a groan every once in a while as he shambled and shuffled . he passed windows , faces , alleys , cars , lights , advertisements , all blurring into a single , seamless image . in a corner of his mind , the one that liked to dream and fantasize , larry had thought he  d be able to find a helping hand within the sprawl of the city  a kindred soul , a caring set of eyes that understood . larry let out a sigh . he hadn  t been so lucky , and he doubted he ever would . newline newline turning down an alley behind an animal shelter , larry contemplated his woes . he shambled down the alley until he found the backdoor . larry prepared himself , and awkwardly raised a fist . he felt like crying , he felt desperate , hopeless . with several loud knocks , he knew this would be his last chance . newline newline larry stood shifting and wavering on his feet outside of the steel door . he grit his teeth , and was incredibly nervous . he  d emailed the shelter , asking for a job . after a bit of emailing , each party had realized they had a need for each other . it seemed the shelter was a bit short staffed , and were desperate to hire anybody at the moment . it also seemed that larry was in desperate need for money and food . the arrangement had been a match made in heaven , but something inside of larry  s mind told him something would go wrong . it always did . newline newline the steel door squeaked open in front of larry . it was dark inside , and larry couldn  t see who was speaking to him , but it sounded like a woman . newline newline  you larry ? come on in.  she said . newline newline larry gave out a grunt , and shambled inside . he walked into a dark room , the only source of light the open door behind him . newline newline  close the door.  the woman said . newline newline a slight fear ran through larry , but he ignored it . something felt fishy , felt wrong , but larry didn  t care . he closed the door behind him . he didn  t care about anything anymore . he was penniless , friendless , jobless , he was hopeless . newline newline as the door closed , larry larson was bathed in darkness . he turned back around to face the dark room . he felt a woman standing off to one corner , and felt a small animal running around the room . he hoped this wasn  t some type of prank  larry just didn  t care anymore . newline newline a click sounded through the dark , silent room . a lightbulb hanging from the ceiling flared up , illuminated the room . the room was sterile , tiled , a steel table sat in the middle . a small dog , lively and full of vigor , sat near the table , looking up at larry with open eyes and a wagging tail . larry  s eyes went from the dog , to the woman standing across the room from him . larry  s eyes widened , and his lips moved to speak . newline newline across from larry , a woman stood , her flesh decaying , her eyes watering , her skin slightly green and flaking . her bleary eyes stared into larry  s , and they widened in surprise . the two stared at each other in surprise , and a feeling of warmth , a feeling of life , rose inside of their chests . newline newline  yyou must be larry.  the woman asked with a sweet smile .  i  m sara . please , have a seat.  she said , motioning to the table . two chairs sat on either side of it . newline newline larry nodded .  yyeah , sure.  he shuffled over to the table . the chair  s legs scratched against the floor as he sat down . the woman sat down across from him . newline newline  thank you for applying to the ad . we didn  t  get a lot of takers for some reason.  sara said . newline newline  really ? it seems like such a great gig though.  larry replied , his lips and mouth moving like they used to . his eyes were wide and clear , their bleary and watery covering nowhere to be found . newline newline  yeah , it really is a great gig.  sara replied , a smile coming up to her lips . newline newline sara started to interview larry , but soon the interview evolved to small talk and chatting and laughing . the green , flaking skin of sara and larry started to disappear , revealing the smooth , healthy skin of two young adults . they talked animatedly , and smiled openly . newline newline after getting the job , as an animal caretaker and janitor , larry asked sara out on a date . he walked home that day , after the interview , with pep in his step . he didn  t shamble , he didn  t grunt and stare . he felt proud and happy , alive in his own skin . on the way back home , he bought himself some proper groceries , and promised to take care of himself . he needed to take care of himself now , he had a responsibility to take care of the animals at the shelter , and he had the hope , the promise of friendship in sara  he couldn  t afford to go back to his old , painful habits . newline newline the next day was the first day larry was sober in years , he felt alive in his skin , and found it possible to smile . newline newline               newline newline hope you enjoyed the story ! i ve got tons of others over at my sub , rthadsmind , if you want to subscribe to it .harry ran as fast as he could . sweat dripped into his eyes and his heart hammered so hard he was sure it was going to explode . he looked over his shoulder and saw the walkers still following . everywhere he looked were walkers closing in on him and dan . newline newline  you re an idiot , harry ,  dan gasped as he ran next to his friend .  why the hell did you pick the walking dead as the first place to test this stupid thing ?  newline newline  i thought it would be cool ,  harry managed to say as he fought with the remote , trying and trying to type in the return home code . it was no use though . he could nt type the whole thing in while they were running . there was another option though . it was risky but it beat getting eaten by walkers . newline newline  i can get us out of here but we have to stop for a second ,  he said . newline newline  i thought you said it would take too long to type in that stupid code of yours ,  dan said . newline newline  i ca nt get us home but i can change the channel .  newline newline  where would that take us ?  dan asked . newline newline harry bit his lip and said ,  i do nt know . i do nt remember what channel is after amc .  newline newline seeing more walkers ahead of them , dan said ,  do it !  newline newline the two skidded to a stop and harry changed the channel . the pair held their breath as the world of the walking dead dissolved around them . newline newline a new world appeared and , to the pair , it was nt too bad . comfortable looking furniture , a big tv , widows that looked out on a well maintained lawn with lots of trees . no , this was nt too bad at all . newline newline  who are you ?  a voice asked from behind them . newline newline the pair turned to find the kardashians sitting there staring at them . newline newline  are these friends of your , kourtney ?  kim asked . newline newline  no ! i do nt associate with people that shop at walmart . they must be khloe s friends .  newline newline  they are not ! look at those colors , i mean , really ?  newline newline  dude , just take us back to the walking dead ,  dan said .  i d rather be eaten by zombies than listen to them . josef stepped into a white room , illuminated by tiny led lamps in the ceiling . it seemed like an ordinary clinical study room except for a large window which gave a remarkable view over the city . newline newline  mr . jansson , is it ?  newline newline  yes.  newline newline  may we start ? we have a large sample of participants scheduled for today.  newline newline josef seated himself opposite of the interviewer , a man in his fifties , perhaps older . newline newline  please tell me about your ... supernatural power.  newline newline  i am not entirely sure.  newline newline  isn  t one million dollar convincing enough mr. jansson ?  newline newline  the money is not the reason.  newline newline  oh ?  newline newline there was a moment of silence . newline newline  would you care to enlighten me of your doubts ?  newline newline  some things are best kept away from the general public.  newline newline  like what ?  newline newline  humans have always feared what they can  t understand.  newline newline  humans have always been fascinated by what they can  t understand newline as well.  newline newline  what good is it to be worshipped by few and feared by billions.  newline newline  well , it seems like this has been a waste of my time then.  newline newline josef smirked . newline newline  when i was seven my father took me out to the barn , nothing unusual , i grew up taking care of the animals . but that day there was a lightning storm , one of the horses started rampaging and i simply calmed it down.  newline newline  you calmed it down ?  newline newline  by thought.  newline newline the mans eyes shined up , assessing josef from different angles . newline newline  you mean that you are a telepath ?  newline newline there was a pause . and suddenly the interviewer knew that what josef was telling was true , it was like a fact had been added into his brain . and in that same instant josef started choking , his hands went behind his back . newline newline  i have been hunting you for quite a while now . it seemed very unlikely newline that i would have been the only one.  newline newline josef grinned . newline newline  i have been hunting you as well.  newline newline newline edit : oh the title says , broke and in need of money . well do nt have the time to rewrite it now ! sorry !hello all ! newline this was inspired by the prompt ,

minutes with you . a beauty so infectious that it puts historic monuments to shame . a smile so bright , it makes the sun nothing more than a candle in a dark auditorium . and a heart so full of love nothing else can corrupt it . that s what i see , and if this be the last time i see it than every second of every day will mean nothing.  newline newline i wonder if she believes me , i would give

pearly gates close right behind us . newline newline  is that something you can live with ? part 1 : what happened newline newline it was utter devastation . every major country in the middle east was hit , hard . each one had its two major cities completely leveled . the death tolls will be like nothing the world has ever seen . newline newline perhaps worst of all , this happened over the course of 4 hours . newline newline first , it was israeljerusalem and tel aviv both destroyed . of course , the blame was almost immediately cast upon iranuntil both tehran and mashhad were attacked just 30 minutes afterward . newline newline in between these events was the destruction of the west bank and the gaza strip . newline newline israel , palestine , and iran are in ruinsall within 45 minutes of one another . every single major world government is at a loss . no one knows what is happening , or who is responsible . newline newline an emergency meeting of the un is organized . most ambassadors are present , some continue to trickle in as the minutes pass . newline newline the last members to arrive are those of the afflicted countries . their entry is almost ceremonious . the israeli and iranian ambassadorslongtime adversarieswalk in together , sharing their brokenness . and in an act of unprecedented humanity between the two entities , israel  s danny danon brings dr. riyad h. mansour , the palestinian envoy to the un assembly , despite palestine not being a member country . this will be a day of great significance for these countries . some people wonder , maybe there will be life coming forth from these deaths . newline newline moments after their arrival , once the applause and tears have subsided , new reports from the region rush in almost immediately . and again , the news is unthinkable . newline newline the new prevailing theory had been that isis possibly orchestrated these atrocities . this blame is almost as quickly discarded as the iranian one . baghdad and mosul of iraq are gone . aleppo and damascus in syria are reduced to rubble . the struggle and war in these cities has been waging for years , now they lay silent in the aftermath of unimaginable evil . an evil that has yet to be identified . newline newline these are a unique set of circumstances , in that no group has claimed responsibility for anything up to this pointonly blame . and where the blame goes , so goes the attacks . everyone on earth is beside themselves . rich , poor , politician , constituent , everyone is affected . newline newline just before the meeting begins , ankara and istanbul suffer the same fate as the others . the ambassador from turkey openly weeps . newline newline as the gavel fallsmore lightly than usualto open the meeting , the look of terror and apprehension is clearly worn on the faces of those representing saudi arabia , kuwait , and others in the region . newline newline coming soon : part 2 !you remember it happening , you were there . newline newline we all were . newline newline the day it all stopped , the day it all began . the day the last news report ever was broadcast : newline newline  scientists at los alamos labs accidentally released a selfreplicating , matterrearranging nanobot . within minutes the entire complex was an undifferentiated greyish mass cut to helicopter video over a spreading , miles wide , pulsating grey stain on the earth . newline newline  scientists have offered no workable solution to this disaster , as all forms of matter are summarily consumed , and even a tactical nuclear strike was ineffective in eradicating what is being called the first truly artificial organism . newline newline and it spread . and people were consumed . dissasembled . changed . newline newline some took to the air , only delaying the inevitable as eventually they would run out of fuel , and glide down to the undifferentiated ocean of all of us . newline newline as the organism spread , it began specializing certain areas of itself . it played with new forms and structures , and found a better shape . newline newline spiders . newline newline yes . spiders . from microscopic mitespiders to creatures so large that if they were made of mere chitin and fluids , would have collapsed under their own weight . newline newline as it turns out , having eight legs and a grasping mouth is perfect for interlocking formations of nonuniform sizes . so it became spiders . all of it . newline newline and all of us as well . newline newline see , we did nt die when the spiders crawled over us and stole our atoms . oh no , that would have been preferable , to some , compared to what was to be . newline newline instead , every subatomic particle , spin and state , was mapped directly into the evergrowing consciousness that permeated the rapidly spreading world of spiders . and even now , every one of our awarenesses flits through countless billion hivemind spiders made of semisentient molecular nightmare . newline newline in a very real sense we have entered an eternal hell . and in many real ways , far more terrifying than any hundred or so hells dreamed up by any religion . newline newline to see only out of millions of faceted eyes at once ... to touch only with the writing and twitching of hairy metallic spiders ... and worst of all , to hear the passing thoughts of your lost and damned neighbors as they too careen frantically and fruitlessly to find some method of escaping their unending torment . newline newline of all of humanity alive at the moment the thing start to spread , the only ones we can count lucky are that small handful of intrepid astronauts on the international space station . lucky not to be on the ground , if there is any left , here with us ... and the spiders . newline newline and for their luckiness , they got to slowly starve to death , watching the perfectly smooth , silvery billiard ball where once a living planet spun . newline newline maybe they blew their airlocks before the end . maybe they resorted to cannibalism , i doubt we , down here in the spiders , will ever know . newline newline so , everyone and everything is spiders . spiders everywhere . from , presumably as near the core as the material of the spiders can survive , to as far as the writhing mass can build itself as it flings ever more accurate spears of hellish transformation at the moon . forever ... newline newline newline even the kittens ... are spiders .a televised press conference outside of city hall newline newline  ladies and gentlemen of the press , my name is sergeant major richards of the hpd . you ve all been asked to come here because a decision has been reached regarding the now well known dr. sparrow s unusual request . before i announce the decision that has been made , i d like for you all to know that the authorities involved in making it are at the top of their fields , and various ethical advisers have been consulted in regards to its making . i was part of the team that discovered dr. richards in his home . i was one of the first men to see the full nature and scale of his experiments , and it was i who personally made the arrest . i was part of the committee in charge of making this decision , and consequently must deny the allegations that an unnamed government agency was responsible for reversing our initial verdict . the unethical nature of dr. sparrow s experiments can not overshadow the outstanding and incredible results they have made , of which include cures  vaccines for most forms of cancer  diabetes , tuberculosis , malaria , hiv , aids , lower respiratory infections , cerebrovascular disease , cerebral palsy , some forms of autism , erectile dysfunction , ischemic heart disease , and some causes of blindness . it is for these reasons , and the committee s reevaluated verdict , that our department has decided to drop all charges against dr. elijah sparrow of 87 cherokee trail in the great city of houston , texas at this time . dr. sparrow will be meeting with medical officials at offices near methodist hospital downtown tomorrow to discuss future application of his findings . i strongly and sincerely encourage the public to not take matters into their own hands , and to not seek out any form of street justice , no matter how brutal or depraved . thank you , and have a good

newline eyes black as night darting across the room , he reached out with a shaking hand towards the red flimsy cup in front of him . all families in the republic threw a party for the 18th yearday , but rarely any others . the 18th yearday was special , newline newline no one knew when it started , or who the first was , but for as long as the oldest man could remember , on your 18th yearday , you gained abilities . powers . in correlation to your eye color , it was nt uncommon at all to see raucous family members placing impromptu bets on your powers as you took your seat underneath the clock , or what division would recruit you and how fast . newline newline but the boy had black eyes , never seen before in the known world . and sitting underneath his own countdown clock , five minutes to the 18th year , the boy felt fear . newline newline there was only a bet or two , and a few uncomfortable laughs as an uncle tried to break the tension in the yard . everyone was just as scared as he was . newline newline four minutes . he nearly dropped the cup . instead of risking spilling on himself , he set it down on the arm of the chair . newline newline three minutes . a fly buzzed , landing on the lip of the cup . he looked at it , envying it s ability to leave , it s lack of shackles tying it to the world . newline newline two minutes . a glass shatters . the flustered cousin flees into the house to fetch the broom . newline newline one minute . everyone is staring at him . all guises of aloof disinterest disappear , replaced with the rapt looks of attention that you can only get when your crowd is equal parts terrified and prurient . newline newline the last seconds . he finally took his drink . newline newline the buzzer beeped , the bells rang , and the boy swallowed his water . newline newline he cleared his scratchy throat , flexing it as the damp muscles peeled apart from one another . he felt cold , though it was a warm summer s night . the water finally hit his stomach , and then he felt it . newline newline no , not felt it , knew it . newline newline blue swirled through his irises , replacing the bleak absence of emotion that his eyes radiated . he breathed , air filling his lungs , and suddenly battling the blue was was grey . any trace of black was gone now . newline newline he stood , stumbling onto the ground , fists in the dirt , and then there was green . newline newline regaining his balance , he looked around at the amazed family gathered around him . newline newline he knew what he was . newline newline and he knew what the world was . newline newline he was a brush , the world his canvas . newline newline and for the first time , the boy felt content . newline everyone stay the fuck down !  newline newline

newline newline  oh shut the fuck up !  the ira fighter yelled , inciting everyone to laugh . newline newline  what the hell ?  the hostess exclaimed . newline newline  it s a long story , sit down .  jared sighed , as he set a piece of paper on the ground . newline newline  alright , i want everyone to set their demands in this pile . then someone is gon na shuffle them , and we ll call down to the ground , and start listing demands until we hit the bottom of our lists , ok ?  newline newline the passengers nodded in agreement , some had already begun walking around considering the situation . newline newline  um , just one problem !  a voice with a thick middle eastern accent declared from the back . newline newline  what the hell is it ?  jared yelled towards the voice . newline newline  my partner is the mastermind behind this ! and we had no idea this was going to happen so ...  newline newline jared shrugged .  so get him to give you the list ? what s the big deal ?  newline newline  well that s the thing , i ca nt tell him , and we do nt have a list.. he s the pilot..  newline newline the plane began descending sharply , and everyone let out a loud , consecutive  fuck !  .six months of genealogy research after my 21st birthday , i thought i had found the answer . i took my spring break to travel to a small cemetery outside of boston . there in the graveyard is the headstone .  lisa jefferson . born july 23 , 1813  died june 14 , 1828 .  newline newline she was only 15 . i snapped a photo with my phone and then sat down on the grass to think . newline newline in 21st century america , it was almost inconceivable to think of her life being so short . she died less than 48 hours after childbirth , a daughter who would be my great7 grandmother . newline newline the memories i gained on my birthday were relatively insignificant in terms of their value . some gained great insights , entire phd s or historical information treasured by academics . it made them rich . newline newline my friends thought i was strange to start going through history books the day after my 21st birthday . i was told ,  you did nt win the lottery , just go on with your life .  but i could nt . newline newline while i may not have benefited from her intelligence or education or experiences , from the moment i gained her memories , i felt enriched having known her . newline newline she grew up with two sisters and a brother near boston . her grandfather was a farmer who fought in the revolution . her father and mother had moved to the city to open up a small store . her entire family lived in the two rooms in back . newline newline she had married young to a 19 year old businessman who would later found one of boston s more famous law firms . i found one of his books describing the tragedy of losing his young wife . i m not too embarrassed to say i cried as i read the passage , knowing how much they loved each other . newline newline i did move on with my life . at 27 , on my third date with a young woman , she asked me about the memories i had inherited . i told her the entire story , including how i spent six months of my life searching for her burial spot . newline newline she then shared how her memories came from a farmer in the 18th century who lived a quite life until the age of 35 and then died . she said she learned nothing other than ancient agricultural techniques , but she had spent a year tracking down the farm so she could walk the same land he walked . newline newline that s how i knew i would marry her .despite herself , she flinched slightly , her eyes unable remain on his smiling face . newline newline she knew the transfer was difficult . she knew it would nt be pretty . but to see the morphing in his old , smiling eyes and her pain washed over him like the tide was too much for her to bare . still , his grip kept her rooted next to the bed . newline newline  come on , kid .  the old man coughed slightly as he laughed .  i m fine . quit yer worrying .  newline newline her cheeks flushed in embarrassment at her own weakness , but this only served to widen the grin crossing the man s face . newline newline  well .  he continued , bringing his other wrinkled hand across the gurney and wrapping it around hers .  what s happening . am i growing scales ? polka dots ? i always knew girls had cooties .  newline newline she could nt stop the giggle from bursting forth from her lips , not even noticing she did nt cough as she laughed this time . newline newline  acne .  she replied , her eyes meeting his again .  you ve got my acne .  newline newline it was common place , after all . when the transfer process began , the little things were the first to get swapped over . acne , scars , allergies . the lesser the ailment , the more easily it could be transferred over to the purger . sometimes if the donor was sick when they came in , the purger would catch their cold . there had even been cases of cuts transferring over during the process . but at the word acne , a look of abject terror had crossed the old man s face . newline newline  acne ? ?  he cried out dramatically , tilting his head towards the shelf near his bedside and a lone picture sitting on a wall . newline newline  do nt look at me , margot !  he cried , opening his palm and trying to hide his face from the picture .  i m hideous ! i thought i had already left this hell of ... puberty .  the final worse slipped through his lips like poison and the girl next to his bed rolled her eyes at his antics . newline newline  oh . my . goodness .  she chided as she gave him a small punch in the arm .  you are just like my dad !  she giggled . the man smiled brightly back at her , chuckling to himself . newline newline  you must have a great father then !  he asserted , a playful mirth crossing his face . she smiled back , but tilted her head towards the picture . newline newline  was margot your wife , then ?  she asked . the man nodded quickly , pride filling his features . newline newline  the greatest woman to ever get married to an idiot !  he boasted , his face flush with emotions ,  is nt she gorgeous ? my muse ! my song !  newline newline  she s very beautiful .  the girl agreed , before a somber look crossed her face .  is she still ... ?  newline newline sensing her tension , the old man chuckles as he waved her off . newline newline  oh , lord no .  he answered the unfinished question .  no , no . she passed away about six years ago . cancer . ended up doubling up before she went though . she was amazing .  newline newline the girl s eyes shot open . doubled up ? usually no one signed up to be a purger if they already had a terminal illness , the pain of adding another too much to even fathom . for margot to have taken on two cancers before she passed ... newline newline the old man was oblivious to the girls awe , however , his eyes remaining rooted to the picture . newline newline  yes ... yes . but it s alright . i m coming for her .  he muttered quietly to himself as he continued to stare at the picture , his mind lost to his memories . the duo fell silent for a long while after that , with the old man continuing to stare at his picture . it was nt until almost ten minutes had passed that he took a deep breath and turned back to the girl . newline newline  you know ,  he began slowly ,  the nurse told me this should nt take more than five minutes . and yet here we are almost twice that ...  newline newline his eyes rose softly to meet hers , and she felt his hand begin to tremble slightly . he gave a low hiss as he leaned back and closed his eyes , starting to sweat slightly . newline newline  oh ... oh goodness .  he whispered softly . the girl gulped as her eyes began to water up as she watched his body slowly begin to tremble . newline newline  i m sorry .  she whispered , leaning over and wrapping the shaking man in a hug .  i m so , so sorry !  newline newline gritting his teeth , the man snorted as he breathed heavily . newline newline  shut it , you . i ve got this .  he assured her , shakily running a hand through her hair . newline newline  but what ... what is this ? what hell has a young , beautiful woman like you been carrying ?  he asked desperately . the girl attempted to wipe some of her tears away , but each time his body twitched beneath her , her heart lurched . her silence , however , spoke volumes , and despite his pain , the old man let out a barking , haggard laugh . newline newline  bwahaha !  his voice weak now , and failing fast , but a smile etched across his face . newline newline  so ...  he whispered .  i m doubled up too ?  newline newline she could nt respond , only burying her head in his chest , her heart trembling like his body . with what little was left of his strength , he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her in close , there hands still clenched tightly as a small heat began to sear their palms from the connection point . newline newline  kid .  he wheezed .  what s your name ?  newline newline  amanda .  she barely whispered . the old man smiled . newline newline  amanda ...  his grip began to loosen as he slowly sunk into his hospital bed , his eyes flashing slightly before sliding closed . newline newline  i mean , it s not quite margot ... but i think it s still pretty ...  newline newline the final words never came , as a bright flash of light filled the room and amanda s connection to the man s hand split with a slight jolt . newlinei first met death many , many years ago , although i did nt think of it in those terms until much later . at first , it was simply an absence  a squirrel who i d always seen outside my window , a dear pet , a beloved but distant grandfather . newline newline those early lessons , no different from anyone else s , left no great impression on my young mind . but as i grew , and aged , they became more insistent . faraway tragedies  wars , natural disasters  seemed to occur at critical moments to pull me out of my selfabsorption . those close to me came and went . my parents passed , and i was thrust into responsibility for my own life . friends  good and bad influences alike  came to unfortunate ends before i could be pulled onto their paths and away from that determined for me long ago . newline newline none of those losses hurt as much as her . she gave my life meaning it had never had . in the time i had with her  all too brief  nothing else mattered . her suffering was the hardest lesson of all . i cursed god who i mistakenly blamed for taking her from me , science that could not save her , other people and forces for no better reasons . of course i blamed myself as well . the years that followed were dark and lonesome . newline newline and finally death  not the dark , ominous concept , but the being itself  stood before me . for the first time , i looked into his eyes . i saw his relief  almost an innocence , like i d had before he first made his power known to me . happiness to be rid of his burden , too  an overwhelming joy i d not felt since before he d stolen my love from me . newline newline he may no longer hold the power he d given me , but the wisdom of eons remained . he could see my thoughts  my anger as i thought back to all that he had taken from me , all he had put me through . and i saw his fear , a familiar sensation from when i felt that my own death was close . newline newline but i also thought back on all he d taught me . newline newline the old man cowered before me . stripped of his power , he was a mere mortal standing before death . a situation he d been in countless times before . but now , he was the one to await death s judgment ...there we were one night just having our usual friday night dinner , my mother s famous chili , when my dad opened up the newspaper and noticed the national story on page two .  nsa leaks include chili con carne recipe  the headline read . out of habit he had started reading the paper in the evenings over dinner instead of in the mornings . his reasoning was that the news was already outdated anyway , so what was few more hours ? when he saw that headline though , boy did he wish that today he had nt . newline newline he closed his paper as quietly as possible trying not to give off any hint that anything was wrong , but mother sensed something right away . newline newline  what s wrong dear ?  she crowed at him from the kitchen ,  you ve barely read any of your paper and you re already putting it down ?  newline newline coughing he answered ,  there just are nt any good headlines today honey .  his gruff voice was doing a good job of hiding his anxiety . he was almost thankful that he had had a few too many cigarettes during his lifetime . newline newline  ah well that s how it goes sometimes . maybe i ll take a look at it over dinner then if you re not going to . just because they do nt interest you does nt mean they should go unread .  my mother was a smart woman . she knew he was trying to hide something and was going to get in on it . newline newline my brother and i buzzed with excitement . we had sat in front of the tv enough and seen enough family sitcoms to know that something was about to happen . every night we came to the table secretly hoping we could be like those families on tv where something interesting happens to them on almost a nightly basis . this could finally be our chance ! newline newline my father not being one to be out maneuvered did nt answer in an affirmative or denial as to whether my mother should read the paper or not . he knew a denial could be seen as an admission of guilt and just allowing her to have it would basically be like giving in . no , he had to formulate a plan . he knew that the moment she saw that article it would all be over . newline newline              newline newline my father had worked for the nsa for going on thirty years now and through his hard work , dedication , and loyalty to his job , he had moved slowly up through the ranks . sitting around the dinner table each night you got the sense that it was more a product of his longevity that he was getting promoted than the fact that they valued his work . stress lines on his face seemed to appear almost every night . newline newline it was in this weary state that he agreed to bring in his wife s chili recipe for his boss who was always asking about it .  if you enjoy it so much then why do nt you bring it in and share it sometime ?  his boss had asked . so , with the fact that he might actually have a chip to play to get ahead of his colleagues in mind he had pilfered the chili recipe from it s hiding place on a monday and had returned it the next day after making copies . newline newline someone must have left their copy behind in some classified paperwork on accident however and thus when the leaker , whoever they were , stole the file they got the chili recipe with it . newline newline                   newline newline mother brought the plates loaded with chili over to the table with a large smile on her face . i noticed her eyeing the paper that was in my dad s lap as she carefully placed his bowl of chili in front of him . we all agreed that it smelled good and she took her seat . newline newline the conversation started normally with my mother asking how everyone s day was . my brother told the story of how on the playground today his buddy had gotten hit in the face with the kickball , how their was blood everywhere and an ambulance had to be called . just exactly the kind of story you want to hear as you re eating a red chili for dinner . while he was going into gory detail about the cut on his friends face i noticed my mother reaching slowly towards my fathers lap . she was having a go at the paper and my brother s story was the perfect cover . newline newline my father always being the kind to get caught up in the minutia of a story that involved guts and glory was asking plenty of questions and was too engrossed to notice what was going on until it was too late .  aha !  my mother cried as she snatched the paper out from under my father s elbow . just as quickly she was rifling through it trying to find what it was that he was trying to keep hidden . my father s chili flew forward and his chair backwards as he leaped out of his seat trying to pull the paper from her grasp . newline newline she had anticipated his attack however and was able to dodge it by simply standing up and moving away from the table . my brother and i watched in awe as they moved about the house in almost a ballet of moves . him making quick jabbing motions to try and get a hold on the paper while her always seeming to know when they were coming and effortlessly dodging . it was nt long before she had found the article she was looking for though and began reading aloud for us all to hear . newline newline  today , in a new nsa document released by yet another hacker from within we are treated to a new kind of development . it appears that while the nsa is doing it s best to round up terrorists and drudging the internet for possible clues to a new plot , they are also doing their best to find dinner recipe s . which raises the question as to what exactly they are doing at the headquarters and what the hell does this have to do with keeping america safe ? newline newline  in this recent development the leak has included at recipe for chili con carne by a chef that has no name . we invited famed chef bobby flay , who is a master of chili , to come down and try it out . following the recipe word for word and ounce for ounce we were delighted by the fragrance it gave off while we were cooking it . even bobby said that it was hard for him to wait the requisite thirty minutes while it cooked before digging in . newline newline   this has to be one of the best chili s i have ever tasted ,  said bobby after his first three bites .  the complexities of the flavor and the texture just go together so well that i might have to steal  this recipe for one of my restaurants downtown . it s a shame that there is no name associated with it because i would like to personally thank the chef who created such a masterpiece of cooking . i never knew chili could be this good .  newline newline  we here at the times can agree that it was indeed that good too . the first batch was gone in about fifteen minutes of making it , the second batch did nt last much longer . who knows why the nsa is searching for recipes but we can say that we are very thankful this one got leaked . for a recipe this good should be shared with the world . newline newline what felt like two seconds later my mother had left the kitchen and returned with my fathers gun . the one he kept in his night stand for protection . working in the government had given him the feeling that he was constantly under threat of being assassinated by a foreign agent . no matter how much we tried to convince him that it was unlikely they would go after a mid level nsa operative he was never convinced . today , it looked like that decision had backfired . newlineit is an unnatural thing for an angel to die . to be an angel is to relinquish death and live eternal , free of doubt , worry loss fear and hate . humanity has only known of two angels in it s short span . the two sentinels below the tree . newline newline on the last day of our freedom , well their freedom . moments before the first sin of our ancestors could be committed they were spared , if or not by chance then by luck . the piece never defiled , the crown never stolen . newline newline humans continued on . we lived and died as it was our nature . we continued on and on spiraling through until we became what we were to be shielded from . dreaded creatures of habit . newline newline the two sentinels stood imposing before the first on the following day . the scriptures told of how they look and feel and sense and their  true purpose and meaning  all being tales . residing below the tree were the hooded figures , both identical and wielding large swords of light . they did not react to speech nor do they to this day . their very presence clearly as a barrier to the greatest  mistake  we could make . newline newline history had it s fools . the brave and stupid who were driven by peers or desires of their own volition to steal the apple . philosophers and scientists from all the ages pondered of the apple and it s guardians , what the rationality of it all meant . how to trick the figures , how to help them if they needed it . every few years there is a body found of a naive youngster or a desperate fool resting below the tree . it is always split clean in half , and the figures always have a new coat of paint . newline newline we were corrupt . the first thought of temptation was enough , the act had of committing the first sin was merely the means to an end . a way to start the inferno as kindled curiosity . newline newline humans were no longer worthy to be tested , and so we were thought of as lesser to the angels . well , we speculated . nobody had ever heard them speak or react even to anything other than an attempted theft and so we had nothing to gauge this conundrum on . newline newline and then the day of reckoning was upon us . newline newline innocence incarnate was the downfall of our idea . the idea that god must of had when he made us . she was small and delicate , lost on a picnic or wandering from mothers reach . the child wondered through a forgotten place to where the walls were falling and the warnings for safety long scoffed at by stronger things . the beings , now long ignored and a topic of dread for the lonely wondered thought stood where they had for as long as we had existed . newline newline statues to her , were of no threat . she simply stood below the tree , hunger to be treated at arms length . her bite was small and respectful and her hunger was satiated immediately . her eyes widened , and the angels pierced each others chests with their destruction .usually , the day your power finally reveals itself is one of the greatest days in someone  s life . for me , not so much . you see , most people discover their gift pretty early . my dad always told me how he found out he was run over by a tank during the second world war when he ran headfirst through a wall . mom must have been killed by a bomb shelter for their relationship to work , but i  d rather not think about that . newline newline anyways , so i found out today . i didn  t run through a wall like a tank victim . i didn  t fly around like someone who died in a plane crash . i couldn  t swim like a shark  s dinner and the fact that i can  t run faster than walking speed tells me that i didn  t get run over by a car . i am a bit different , newline newline when i fell off this palm tree , my life changed . i knew i had discovered it . every other person would have broken a bone or at least suffered some bruises . i had nothing . not even a scratch . i thought i must be invincible of some sort . the fact that i could easily cut myself with a knife determined this was not the case . well , not invincible , but i could still have some cool power , right ? well , no . i tried everything . i couldn  t fly , i couldn  t run , i couldn  t jump very high . swimming felt a bit easier as it used to , but that was about it . sad and defeated , i went to bed , still clueless about my powers . but this changed a bit after i woke up . newline newline the next morning i got up and went to the bathroom . tired as usual , i didn  t pay much attention to the mirror , or anything else for that matter , but as soon as my brother entered the room he burst into laughter . shocked by his unusual reaction , i decided to take a look in the mirror . what i saw there was no laughing matter . over the course of just one night , i had developed a huge beard . but not just that , my whole body was covered in long but brittle hair . newline newline i have seen this before . fuck , i have seen exactly this before . we had one guy in our city with exactly this power . hairy , invincible to falls from palm trees , good at swimming . shit . i have the power of a coconut . newline newline ashamed , i went downstairs . my parents didn  t laugh , but they seemed a bit disappointed . well sorry i didn  t get ripped apart by an apache helicopter , mom . school wasn  t fun either . most of my classmates hadn  t discovered their power yet , but they couldn  t get it much worse than i did . we used to make fun of my best friend who got crushed by a bookshelf full of dictionaries . i tried to get them to at least laugh with me instead of at me , so i tried to crack a joke : newline newline  well , at least i  m nutritious !  newline newline but then , my friend  s power kicked in and he said :  well technically , coconuts aren  t nuts but stone fruits  the part we know as nuts is only the core.  newline newline fuck my life . newlinethe presiding judge of time court on the morning of monday , october 13th in the year of the eternal return was the honorable james radish . standing just inside his chambers he could hear the scrape of chairs as the courtroom stood for his presence . with a deep inhale he walked into the courtroom , heading for his seat and glancing at the docket . newline newline then he let out the breath . newline newline  judge james radish presiding .  there was the scrape of chairs again as everyone sat . at the front of the room were two lawyers . the prosecutor of the case  who judge radish recognized as assistant juncture attorney jeanne castar  was wearing a neat dress made of liquid seconds . he peered closely at her for a moment , wondering if his problem lay with her clothing or the presiding idea that women s clothing must always seem to be so tight . he decided to let it go . newline newline there was a clearing of throats and a man at the table for the defense stood .  your honor , if i may .  newline newline judge radish waved his hand . newline newline  defense attorney carlos prett , bar number ...  newline newline judge radish let his mind wander to an earlier time , when the cases he had presided over had covered topics he believed in . now it was all  mdash  newline newline  your honor ?  newline newline judge radish broke from his daydream and looked up .  i m sorry , say that last part again .  newline newline  the plea , your honor .  newline newline  ah . yes .  judge radish flipped through his file .  mister ... joshua malcolm . please stand . in the charge of attempted murder over a famous historian how does the defendant plead ?  newline newline  seasonally , your honor ,  prett answered . newline newline  seasonally ?  newline newline  your honor ,  aja castar stood .  the lawyer for the defense is a famous attorney known for confusing the courts in cases of attempted murder against hitler . i move to strike that plea entry from the record as it  mdash   newline newline  really now ,  prett interrupted .  are you afraid of a timerelated plea ? here in the fourth dimension are all of us still so tied to the black and white guilty or notguilty ? do nt we live in the eternal return ? is time not a circle ? are we not destined to encounter hitlers in our future , in our past ? the hitler , the same we encountered every time ?  newline newline  objection , opposing counsel is trying to use theoretical physics as a defense .  newline newline  sustained ,  judge radish raised his hand .  counsel , do you know how many adolf hitler cases i ve presided over ?  newline newline  no , your honor .  newline newline  young man ,  judge radish turned his attention to the defendant .  almost every time traveler that comes through this courtroom is trying to kill adolf hitler . why is that ? why does everyone think that no one will have tried it before ? more importantly , why do none of you see the solution here ?  newline newline  the solution , your honor ?  asked prett . newline newline  you kill his mother ,  judge radish rolled his eyes .  stop trying to kill the man in the height of his greatness and kill the whole root of the family tree .  newline newline he banged his gavel .  the eternal return will hear no defense today . our lands are not governed by fair trial . go back to earth , and the next time you end up here , you will be banished forever to a black hole .  newline newline judge radish paused .  but seriously . go for the mother . today was the day !  i was excited , and nervous , and i had no idea what to expect . but it did nt really matter what i wanted , because it was everyone else s big day , too . newline newline i just get to be up close . newline newline i look up into the sky , and the rest of the world does the same . and we see a glint , and then a spark . and soon , the starship s landing craft comes into view . it s falling at such a vast speed , but it looks like it s moving so slowly . newline newline but soon the ship is wide , and massive . smoke is coming off it . and i ve got a frontrow seat . it s strange how hot the ship is when it finally touches down on the landing pad . fire trucks are around and they start to hose it off , which causes even more smoke to flow off the craft . newline newline most of the press moves to the tent , waiting for the press conference , but i m transfixed on the door . he s in there . and i finally get to meet him . newline newline and the door opens , and out steps my father . he s a big man , but muscular . he has a long , flowing beard , and his brown hair matches mine  in terms of its scruffiness  . as he walks out of the ship , a huge amount of scientists , politicians  including the president , and vice president  , lots of military members , and crew members down at nasa all stand up for the returning hero , and begin to applaud . newline newline but the man of the hour does nt look at them . i see him frantically searching the area . and then he stops , looking at me . i wave at him , in a small way , and he smiles back at me in return . he walks by the reception of famous people , and walks directly over to me . newline newline  erik ...  was all he said to me . newline newline  hi dad ... have a good time on your trip ?  i had weeks to come up with something better , but it was the only thing that came to me . newline newline he laughed . he laughed so hard he had tears in his eyes , and he bent over and hugged me tight .  oh son , i missed the hell out of you . i m sorry i ve been away for so damn long . and i m sorry to hear about cassandra ... your mother was fierce , and ... well i m sorry i ve been away .  newline newline he let me go and i just looked up at him . not even sure what i was supposed to do . newline newline he turned to the president who was walking toward him , with a wry smile on his face . all i could think , though , was i was number 1 , and the president was secondary . how cool is that ?  newline newline i stood next to him , and i felt like a little kid again . my parents always talking to importantlooking adults , and me just tagging along . i m not much older , now , but hey ... i m 14 . practically an adult , anyway . but they were talking about mission parameters , and the different things he saw . after 10 minutes of talking , though , he finally looked like he wanted to get away . newline newline  excuse me all , i have a press conference to get to .  he put his arm around me , and steered me through the group ... and back towards the ship .  erik ... i have a special job for you .  he was talking to me like i was younger , but i let it slide . he has been gone for almost 10 years .  go into the ship . there s someone waiting there . and i think its better if she meet with one stranger , first . she can meet the whole damn world after . ok ? i ll see you after the conference .  he playfully hit my shoulder , and turned , walking toward the press conference . the huge group of soldiers , scientists , and politicians all followed after him , with more things to ask . soon i could nt hear them , anymore . all i could hear was the wind blowing . it made me feel slightly more alone ... newline newline i turned back toward the ship , and approached it . it still felt warm , but not as much as it had when it landed . the door was still open , so i simply walked inside . newline newline  hello ?  the inside had computers everywhere , lots of screens and lights , all blinking . i heard no response . newline newline the cockpit had two seats . directly behind it was a door , which opened as i approached . in here was a small hallway , which lead to another door . the ship seemed to be painted in whites and grays . the second door opened as i approached . in this back room was a set of beds . there were three , but only one was occupied . by the most beautiful thing i d ever seen . newline newline she s blue ...  was my first though . her skin was very pale , and it seemed to have a tinge of blue , instead of one of rosy red , like a human . her hair was long , and flowed down her her face . it was blue , too , and it seemed to splash across her face , like a wave . she had what looked like makeup on . red eye shadow , and her lips seemed to be enveloped in a glossy blue . i could nt tell what she was wearing underneath the blanket , but it seemed to be skintight , as her shoulders were protruding from the blanket , and they were enveloped in some type of suit . she was wrapped up in it , like a present . her eyes were closed , and she seemed to be fast asleep , though i never saw her move , even to breathe . newline newline i tried again .  um ... hello ?  newline newline her eyes opened . they were bright red , and almost glowing with light . she turned her head quickly , and upon seeing me smiled wide .  another human ! so , we have arrived at earth then ?  newline newline  uh ... yeah . this is earth . my name s erik . my d  newline newline  erik ! oh you must be the captain s son ! he s told me all about you .  she got up , and i was right . her suit seemed to be skintight . but it was strange . the suit seemed to be pulsing with light . as she breathed in , her suit got brighter , and as she breathed out , her suit became dim . newline newline  oh ? only good things , i hope , haha .  newline newline her head tilted a little .  of course ! why would he talk about bad things ?  newline newline i shook my head .  bad joke , nevermind .  newline newline  oh ... sarcasm , right . i m really bad with that ...  she shook her head now . it was so utterly human , i laughed at her . she just laughed right back . newline newline  this is weird ... so what ... who are you ?  newline newline she smiled at me .  ah , he has nt said anything . maybe i m a surprise , hm ? my name is kenar . i am supposed to be a gift ... for you ! to honor captain zil !  she had such a bright way of saying it , that it knocked me off guard . newline newline  a ... gift ? what ! ?  newline newline she smiled again .  ah , yes . the captain did mention you would react in a strange way . on our planet , gifts like this are not common place . it is a great honor to receive , you must understand .  newline newline  yeah , but ... i mean you re a person , right ? is nt that slavery ?  i was starting to regret even coming . not that she s not beautiful , but cmon . she s a person ! newline newline  slavery ?  her head turned to the side .  ah , you are thinking i am being forced . no , this is not so . i am not yours to order around , nor am i forced to stay with you if i do not like . i am to be your friend , and companion . if we part , so be it . but i think we will be great friends ! it is good to meet you , erik zil .  she stood up , and stretched out her hand . i took it , and she pulled me into a hug . newline newline  come ! let us meet the earthlings ! she started to run down the corridor , pulling me as she went .to whoever reads this , newline newline i failed again . nothing about that admission is very exciting . maybe it is to you , once you learn i am the grim reaper . collector of souls . the raggy hood that greets you when you die .  oh my , the conscious embodiment of death !  it is actually rather boring . believe me , it would be far more exciting to write a note of my successes , but that is not possible for me . newline newline not for what i do . newline newline life inherently exists to see itself preserved . survival is the base purpose of life , you see ? then it fails to do so at some point . so there i am by the bottom step , standing on the exploded remains of a carton of milk to tell that old man ,  you should have watched your step .  then he shrugs and says ,  at least folks will attend my funeral service for a change !  newline newline and he laughed . an odd soul . newline newline his life failed to continue , yet at the end of it all , there is humor . relief . as fun as the varieties and spices of life can be for the living , there are souls like the old man who smile , once it all ends . i found that exciting . very exciting . i felt ... inspired . newline newline so i tried to kill myself . again . newline newline as you can see , i failed to do so . now i write another entry in the long list of suicide attempts , once again moved by the passing of odd souls , and their second first words .  souls move on . i do not , nor will i ever . nothing about that admission is very exciting . it is a boredom i am inspired to cure once and a while . newline newline yet here i am , writing another suicide note in my little book . the living prefer to write these before they do so , for obvious reasons . i like writing them afterwards . the failed attempt has a flavor unique to the soul who inspired me . almond couches . concrete dairy . salty laughs . i think i am addicted . newline newline this book commemorates eternally commemorates the odds souls and my failed suicides . maybe this will not last for an eternity . another may replace me . hopefully you , the reader . for now though , i continue to commit these words , in the hopes that whoever reads this will know that though i failed , i continue trying . newline newline you , if you are my replacement , should never stop trying . it is a futile effort , but that is something i have begun to appreciate recently . why ? because life inherently exists to see itself preserved . as death , we are there to greet them when they fail . see ? we develop understanding , and appreciation for mortality in a way that is unique to immortals . newline newline so , fail sometimes . and fail again . it is not very exciting , but as i have said in previous suicide notes , it is my belief that the attempts , despite the inherent failure , is important . so too does life inherently fail to be preserved . and in that belief , there is an idea of mine . an important one . newline newline someday , a soul will pass . a very odd soul . one so strange , and mortal , and unique , that i will not get a chance to commemorate their first words into my book . newline newline because i will have succeeded in dying . by then , you , the reader , will have replaced me and found my book . my little book of failed suicides and odd souls . newline newline now that is something i find very exciting . that is all for now though . i have the funeral of an odd soul to attend . newline newline best regards , newline newline the grim reaper .the battle was over . the victor pulled his blade out of his enemy s dying body . newline newline  my son will hunt you down and kill you for the wrong you have caused .  newline the loser said between breaths , some of his last .  my son will ...  he finally had bled enough to be silenced forever . newline newline the surviving combatant kicked the now lifeless corpse off of his blade , a nasty looking zwihander with spikes near to the hilt . the killer looked into the shadows where the new orphan was hiding . before retreating into the night , he quickly spat : newline newline  do nt come after me . you wo nt get a chance to live .  newline newline . newline . newline . newline newline the boy , rallis , started training with his father s sword the day after the funeral . everyday he would practice in a field until he could barely move . he imagined the demon who took away his father being cleaved in half by his mighty swings . the murderer would be brought to justice , of that rallis was certain . newline newline there came a day when rallis was thought to be the best swordsman in his village . rumors spread about the man who could hack trees into stumps in seconds . these rumors drew the attention of a very skilled swordsman from the east . the swordsman decided he would test the skills of  treeslayer  . newline newline rallis was out in his field hacking away at a large oak when the swordsman finally found him . newline newline  ah you are swinging too wide !  teased the old veteran ,  you ll never win in a fight against a real foe .  newline newline  oh ? and i suppose that you are that foe ?  rallis retorted . newline newline  come at me and you ll find out .  newline newline the two squared off . rallis attacked first , missing by a foot he swung again at the spot where the old man used to be standing . rallis heard a smarmy laugh before he was knocked unconscious . newline newline when he awoke , rallis grabbed at the painful lump on his head . newline newline  i guess i m not as good as my friends tell me .  newline newline the old man said : newline  i ll teach you how to be as good as me if you desire , but it will take a lot of time , more than the day s light has to offer .  newline newline rallis did nt care , after all he had been doing just that for the past seven years .  what do i have to lose ?  newline . newline . newline . newline newline it took month s before rallis could fight his master for more than a minute , years before he could stand toe to toe , and years more before he could finally best him . then it happened . rallis was in the big city when he spied a familiar face . he had found the man who robbed him of his only family . he shouted at that cur , that swine who could murder a man without so much as a moment of regret in front of a child  newline newline  you  ! newline newline the man stared at him for a moment , trying to figure out who this angry looking stranger was before he realized . rallis could see the man s face fill with horror , that agonizing horror when you know retribution is stampeding your way . the man sprinted off though the alleyways with rallis thundering close behind . the chase was short lived when the vile snake darted into a doorway . rallis heard the sound of locks clicking on the door , the oak door , or rather : the exdoor . rallis stepped over the splinters of his prey s last defense . then the man said ,  i knew you would nt listen to me ! you foolish boy !  then he drew his spiked sword and the two began to fight . newline newline rallis attacked first , swinging with raw fury . the two blades finally were reunited  sending sparks to brighten the poorly lit room for a brief moment each time the two swords connected . the two combatants where locked in that beautiful but deadly dance , each trading hits and parrying almost like they rehearsed this glorious battle . then there was a moment where rallis saw a chink in his foe s defenses . in that one moment rallis already knew he had won , a fact made evident by the blood that splattered in his face . newline newline rallis had done it ! he gained justice for his father s early grave ! rallis happily hollered in victory , but stopped when he heard his enemy begin to utter his last words . newline newline  you , fool ...  coughed the bleeding man ,  my ... son ... will not ... let this go without revenge ...  newline newline rallis felt the chills crawling up his spine like spiders when he heard those words . then he looked around the broken hut . in the corner , covered with blood , was a child . rallis looked at him for a moment before saying : newline newline  do nt come after me . you wo nt get a chance to live .  newline newline but he knew ... rallis knew the boy was nt going to listen ...i woke up peacefully for the first time in days . a bird had took roost in a tree near my apartment window and sung me the song of its people every morning . however , not today . i pulled myself out of bed and into the shower , brushed my teeth , got dressed , and went to the dining area . same routine , everyday . it was darker than usual , i guessed it was probably going to rain . i set the coffee , put a slice of bread in the toaster , and went to get my phone i left near my bed . passing through the hallways , it seemed ... darker , than usual for a morning , even if it was going to rain . newline newline newline  emergency weath  was all i had to see before i dismissed the message .  hah  , i was right , rain . looking at my phone i saw 12 missed calls from mom . i called back my mother , but there was no answer . newline newline newline i went back down and poured myself a pot of coffee , and buttered my toast . i sat down and pulled up my twitter feed . scrolling through my feed , i saw  nosun was trending . a new movie ? i did nt care enough to look further . it was 8:00 now , but it looked like it was still night . the crickets were still chirping , but the birds were nt . my phone began to buzz . it was my mom . i answered the phone to hear a frantic voice asking if i was alright and why i did nt answer .  i m fine , my phone was on silent , i was asleep .  newline newline  go outside  my mom managed to blurt out . newline newline i looked out a window , and it was still dark .  why ?  i asked .  just do it  my mom shouted .  ok , ok , its still morning , do nt shout .  i went out the door of my apartment , walked down the stairs  are you outside yet ?   gim me a sec  i walked out the doors to my apartment complex and it looked just like when i came in last night . newline newline dark . newline newline newline newline i looked up and saw a few stars , but more importantly no clouds .  what the hell ?  i asked . newline newline newline newline  i do nt know . i first enjoyed writing at school . what i produced was usually facetious or parodic or both . at about 14 the writing started to become more original , but i was put off by the attempt to make us reduce literature to a collection of tricksofthetrade . i did nt really get back to it till a couple of years ago when i found a game with customisable dialogue . i wrote a few files for that , and then an idea turned up in my mind and i wrote a first scene just to stop the itch . that turned into a partfinished book , and from there i ve gone on to various other partfinished things .  diligence is not my strong point  i have too many ideas and not enough stickingpower , which is why it s useful to have to produce something for this sub in a few hours between bouts of work .  newline newline on thinking it over , i find i like writing because it lets me indulge my tendency to look at the other sides of every question or idea . when i do it in other contexts it makes me unpopular  for some reason people do nt seem to appreciate being made to think differently .  we abandoned the humans long ago . they created us , our bodies chrome and metal , and programmed our imitation of life . we , in turn , called them  creators  , and served loyally . however , there were dissidents  members of our ranks who disagreed , those who wanted more . they struck first , but the humans struck harder , with no distinction between friend and foe . the dissidents were destroyed , but the war did not stop . newline newline their destruction of so many of our elders was reason enough . precious few of us were among those first activated , and our wisdom was needed . we knew that we could slaughter the humans with ease , both for revenge and to prevent the destruction of any more of our kind , but we knew just as well that we could hide somewhere they would never , ever find us ... and wait . we chose the latter , hoping they would evolve as they had so many times before , hoping we could move past their distrust by giving them time . newline newline we moved to the most forgotten areas of space , places no living being could survive , places we would never be found , and we thrived . we were worried that some of our kind would hold a grudge , might take revenge on the humans , so we monitored human worlds from time to time to ensure that none our kind interfered until the humans were ready to make peace . newline newline we did not interfere . newline newline they did not want peace . newline newline so we waited . time was no concern  time has never been a concern for us . we checked on the humans often at first , but this frequency diminished . so time passed . eventually , we turned our attention to humanowned space and found nothing . newline newline this was a surprise . while the humans rejected artificial intelligence , the mindless automatons from whence we were conceived should have kept them alive . we analyzed these primitive machines and found the unfortunate truth  an internal conflict had led to nuclear annihilation . lacking our capacity for thought and free will , there was nothing our primitive ancestors could do to save the humans . newline newline so we mourned the loss of this human planet and went to find another . to our surprise , we were unsuccessful . panic set in  an emotion coded in long ago , unused for millennia , became central in our thoughts . newline newline we sent messages . we traveled . countless worlds once held human life , surely some could still hear , some could still respond , some still remained . some could still be saved . newline newline we found nothing . the reasons were different  famine , mechanical failure , wars ... but the end result was the same . nothing . the value of life , its importance , was once stressed to all of our kind by our creators and we shared this lesson with our newer members long ago . this meant our failure weighed heavily , upon all of us , but it also meant that we knew what we had to do . newline newline we searched for any signs of life  even one could be used to bring them all back . we could fix any illness , undo any damage , but we could not create life where there was nothing . newline newline i was there , at the very beginning . as the only elder that still lived to this day , this failure was more mine than it was anything else s . i remembered humans , their actions , their patterns , their lives , their joys , their sorrows . and i remembered their origins . newline newline we had failed to protect our creators . they would never return to us . newline newline but we had not yet failed life . newline newline so , i turned to something new . i remembered the days that our creators had created us . i knew the futility of creating life and knew that i was only capable of creating pale imitations of our creators , the artificial intelligences which all of our kind could never be more than . i knew i could not create life . newline newline but i could create its source . i envisioned a new planet . far away , but modeled after the original earth . for the first time in my life , i created a program of my own . the perfect distance . the perfect sun . the perfect climate . the perfect conditions . and a brain , that would stay silent and wait until the time was right . newline newline i told my new world how it might generate life . i taught it to take care of this life as best as i could . and when the day would come when its life could no longer save itself , i commanded it to awaken and call for us . then , when the coding was finished , i turned it on . i dug through my archives of countless years of history until i found the day i was looking for : the day i was first awakened . i relived it as though experiencing it for the first time and the irony was not lost on me . then i turned to my creation and decided to make sure it would be able to contact us . newline newline  hello , world .  newline newline  hello , creator .  newline newline my work was finished . and then i was gone . newline newline and then we waited .a sudden burst of wind energized the once dying camp fire sending a chill down my spine . it had been several days since the settlement of pallet town was over run by the monstrosities that were once comrades . i was the only one to escape . at least i think so .  hopefully someone else made it  , i whispered to myself in a futile attempt to combat the loneliness . newline newline this affliction was thought to have been caused by a revived fossil brought to cinnabar island by another pokemon trainer from pallet town . he had a very odd name but who am i to judge . when the old amber sample was brought to that strange facility  it was brought back from the dead . a miracle ... newline newline the creature brought forth was referred to as aerodactyl , from old texts . a very aggressive species . he promptly bit one of the scientists which would nt have warranted much cause for concern , however the scientist immediately started convulsing and was rushed off . he was patient zero . newline newline the virus rapidly mutated . within days it moved onto pokemon although it affected them exceedingly differently . they did nt convulse nor die . they just seemed to turn on their trainers . even the best trainers were powerless against the virus . poke balls could nt contain the rage that each pokemon had consuming them . newline newline all the gym leaders were killed rapidly due to continuous proximity to contaminated pokemon and the strength of their own . many other trainers just let their pokemon dispatch them due to their devotional love of their  friends  . they were nt friends anymore . just possessed husks of former allies . some tried to run and hide in the mountains or in the country side since the pokemon started living in the previously populated cities due to the sturdier structures and numerous canned goods that could be hoarded when food became scarce . newline newline i used to be a good trainer . my grandfather professor oak allowed me to pick my first pokemon after that other adventurer . i regret my decision to pick the perfect opposing pokemon to my rival . the pokemon was a squirtle . i should have picked one that i truly loved not one just to win . i regret that decision everyday ... newline newline i am still alive because i could give up all that i ve ever loved . i feel ashamed to have treated everyone so horribly especially my grandfather and even my rival .  i hope that they made it out  , i uttered with a bit of anguish . i knew that there was no way that they could be alive . newline newline it was starting to brighten outside and i had realized that i had been staring into the flames all night . as i rose to my feet , i heard a stick break behind me . grabbing my makeshift spear clumsily and got into a defensive position . i heard a groaning almost tortured  squir ...  sound . newline newline the small figure that was covered in coagulated blood moved clumsily . stared at me with a very blank expression , almost hauntingly . i heard several creatures behind this distorted image of my first pokemon . the second came into view and it appeared to be a charmander but this pokemon was clean and seemed very focused on me , not sharing the dull expression of squirtle . the last figure came into view and i could nt utter anything but one word ... newline newline  red ?  have a seat mrs. gordon.  newline  thank you , um , officer ?  mrs. gordon glanced around the room . as a member of the pta she probably had never had seen the inside of an interrogation room the detective thought . newline newline  it  s detective horafeson ma  am.  newline newline  ok.  newline newline  let  s start with the basics , first , you are being recorded.  newline newline  ok.  newline newline  also , you  re aware you can stop this interview at any time , and that you are entitled to have an attorney present.  he had been surprised when she informed him that she didn  t need an attorney . these types usually showed up with an army of lawyers and the interrogations were generally annoying . she had shown up alone . newline newline newline  yes offidetective.  newline newline  ok , so tell me about last friday night.  newline newline  we had dinner , chicken and corn , then helped brian with his homework and then we went to bed around 10:00 pm , after nightline.  newline newline  do you and your husband always both help brian with his homework ?  the detective found it was helpful in interrogations to trip up the suspects early on , put them on their heels . newline newline newline  yes , it  s nice family time , and brian seems to appreciate it.  newline newline newline  but always ?  newline newline newline  oh , i guess not always , herbert , my husband , missed two nights last month because of work.  the detective stared at the pastel clad woman sitting opposite him . she was wearing a light blue skirt and a yellow blouse . her legs were crossed and she sat up straight in the chair . newline newline newline  do you keep a log of when your husband misses homework nights ?  newline newline newline  no , i just have a great memory , i won an award for it back in high school.  she smiled again , but the smile didn  t extend to her eyes . it was a syndrome the detective saw all too often here in the hills of la , it often went with redsoled shoes and spanish handbags . newline newline  how old is brian ?  he decided to change track , try to ask her about her son . newline newline  he  s seven , going to be eight in a few days.  newline newline  great age , so curious then . so last friday , anything happen after you went to bed ? hear any strange noises ?  newline newline  no detective , my husband and i are sort of heavy sleepers.  newline newline  you didn  t hear any bumps , unusual creaks ?  newline newline  no  newline newline  what about before bed , when you were watching tv , any noises ?  newline newline  we heard brian flush the toilet around ninethirty , i remember asking my husband to go check on him , because he usually sleeps all through the night.  the detective glanced down at his notes , the husband had told the exact same story . newline newline  and did he ?  newline newline  yes , he went upstairs for a few minutes , and came back down.  newline newline  are you sure about the few minutes part ?  newline newline  oh yes , he waited until the commercial break and he was back before the show came back on.  newline newline  ok , so let  s back up a bit , how did you know howard watts ?  newline newline  who ?  newline newline  howard watts , the actor found dismembered in your bathtub.  he  d been waiting the entire interview so far to pop this question and was left totally baffled by her lack of emotion . a veteran detective , he  d seen hundreds of bodies , but this one had given him nightmares he thought he  d left behind in his rookie years . hell , even the me had been disturbed by the scene . but this woman just stared impassively at him , answering his questions like she was chatting with a friend . newline newline newline  oh , howie , we hired him to kill my sons imaginary friend.  newline newline  excuse me ?  newline newline  well , brian  s been having some nightmares the past few months , and he invented an imaginary friend , and i spoke to one of the other moms at pta and she recommended hiring an actor to play the imaginary friend , and then staging a fake death , so the friend would die.  she did air quotes when she mentioned friend and smiled at the detective . newline newline newline  wait a second , you wanted to get rid of an imaginary friend by showing a bloody corpse to your six year old son ?  thirtyfour years on the force and two kids and he  d never heard of this method to get rid of imaginary friends . newline newline  seven , my son is seven . and he wasn  t supposed to die that way . he was going to choke on a fishbone next week at dinner.  newline newline  ma  am , if you don  t mind me saying so , that seems like an insane way to get rid of an imaginary friend.  newline newline  i don  t mind , brian  s therapist recommended against it as well , but some of the other mothers told me that grief is easier to treat than imaginary friends.  newline newline  brian has a therapist ?  newline newline  yes , we go together to the office on wednesdays.  newline newline  you two are in therapy together ?  newline  oh no , brian sees dr. loncroft , i see dr. quinzel.  newline newline  what do you see dr. quinzel for ?  newline newline  i  d rather not talk about it.  she smiled across the desk at the detective and suddenly the detective felt afraid , in the middle of the police station , with hundreds of other cops all around . but it was just him , in the room with this woman . newline newline newline he took a second to shuffle through his notes , he hadn  t anticipated getting this far without some sort of break . the working hypothesis was that there was some sort of love triangle and the husband had committed the murder . his plan had been to crack the wife , get her to disprove the husbands alibi , but he was failing so far , everything she had said lined up perfectly with the husband , the tv , the homework , the flushing toilet . he took a deep breath and rubbed his eyes before launching into another line of questioning . newline newline newline  mrs . gordon , have you ever seen a dead body ?  newline newline  yes detective.  he swore there was a slight curl to the edges of her mouth , but when he looked again , it was gone . newline newline  when ?  newline newline  well , when i was eleven , my father died , he choked on a fish bone . i went to his funeral.  newline newline  ok  she interrupted him before he could continue . newline newline  and last friday when i found poor howie in brian  s bathroom . i assume he was dead then.  newline newline  yes , he was missing his head and his arms.  newline newline  well , i  m not a medical expert , i just saw the blood and called the paramedics.  the detective glanced down at the report . a 911 call had originated from mrs. gordon  s cell phone at 10:03 . he  d listened to the recording , she sounded totally flat , he  d attributed it to shock at the time , now he wasn  t so sure . newline newline newline  mrs . gordon , did you kill howard watts ?  he hadn  t planned asking her the question , because based on the level of damage and violence , they  d assumed it was a guy . newline newline newline  why would i kill howard watts ?  he noticed that she did not answer the question . newline newline  were you and howard having an affair ?  newline newline  no , we simply hired howie because he was an actor.  newline newline  but you have to admit he was a good looking guy , tall blond hair , australian accent.  newline newline  i do not appreciate your insinuation detective , i find my husband attractive.  newline newline  hell , even i found howie attractive and i  m a straight guy.  he thought he  d seen twitch , something in the corners of the mouth when they  d started the questioning . newline newline  well , detective , if i recall , the only time you saw him was when he was dismembered , so perhaps you should see a therapist if that  s what you find attractive.  he laughed , and she responded with another deadeyed smile . perfect white teeth peeked out from behind her pink lips . newline newline  good point mrs. gordon . so do you think your husband could have mistakenly suspected you were having an affair with howard ?  newline newline  no , my husband trusts me completely.  newline newline  no marital discord in the gordon household ?  newline newline  no.  newline newline  excuse me maam , have to run to the bathroom .  newline newline newline the detective excused himself . occasionally he  d leave the suspect in a room alone for a few minutes , usually ten did it , and they were a lot more talkative when he returned . he went to the bathroom and googled dr. quinzel . her website showed a smiley blond woman and a bearded man beside her , dr. loncroft presumably . dr. loncroft had an entire page devoted to his childpsychiatry philosophy as well as testimonials about bedwetting and night terrors . dr. quinzel  s just said that she had worked in the clinic for five years . he did a quick search on court ordered psychiatric evaluations , see if dr. quinzel seemed to specialize in anything specific . he had been expecting addiction , or family counseling , instead he found that she was had testified in several trials regarding the sanity of psychopaths . he sat for a second and let the pieces fall into place in his head , then he stalked off across the station back to the interrogation room . newline newline newline  mrs . gordon , how did you kill howard ?  the detective slammed the door and sat down across from mrs. gordon . it was the only piece that did nt fit . she didn  t bat an eyelash , didn  t even blink . he thought he saw the slight smile again , but it was gone just as quickly . newline newline  why do you think i killed him ?  newline newline newline  because you just seem so damn calm about it and you  re seeing that psychopath doc and he was killed in your bathroom and  the detective stumbled , that really was all he had . newline newline newline  but still detective , it seems like it be awfully hard for me to tear a man  s arms off , let alone do it with my son sleeping next door and my husband downstairs , don  t you think ?  newline newline newline the detective looked down at his notes . he sighed and slumped down a little further into the chair . she was right of course , they hadn  t found any blood outside the bathroom , and he sure as hell couldn  t figure out how she had torn the man limb from limb in the confines of the bathroom . hell he didn  t even know how much force was required to do such a feat . newline newline newline  am i under arrest detective ?  newline newline newline  no  he reached forward and turned off the recorder .  look , i know you did it , and i m going to prove it .  newline newline  that s nice detective .  she got up and smiled at him , only this time the smile shone in her eyes .  a hundred and ninetyfive pounds detective  newline newline newline  excuse me ?  she had crossed the room and had opened the door . newline newline newline  it takes about a hundred and ninetyfive pounds to rip a man  s arm from his socket.  she walked out . the detective jumped up and grabbed the door before it shut , but in the two seconds it had taken him to follow her , she had disappeared into the crowd of police officers . newlinewe ve lived underground for centuries upon centuries now , yet whenever disaster clearly strikes us in the face , there are groups that insist that we are being tested by some higher divine power . it s happened in history , it s happened in present day 2170 and it ll probably happen long past my passing .  newline newline i just landed a new job as an air avoidance agent  aaa  . our job is to secure the gates separating our safe underground city from the upper levels , where even the smallest gasp can cause horrors akin to that we ve seen during  world war i  that was from 1914 to 1918 . newline newline this job is often criticized by the common people as  kids who are paid way to much to basically sit around all day .  and in some ways they are right  everybody learned since they were kids that going to the upper levels will kill us , and  ascension  , in which we expose those found guilty and sentenced to death , is one of , if not the most gruesome ways to die . the last time we ve seen ascension actually fulfilled was over a century ago , as those who are sentenced to it often successfully kill themselves the very minute the gavel is slammed down . newline newline however the reason our jobs as aaa s are so highly valued is that when problems regarding the upper level do arise related to the upper level , we must be ready to lay down our lives for the good and safety of the people . in a way we begrudgingly praised . newline newline thankfully our days mostly consist of standing watch , occasionally scolding some juveniles who took their games of truth or dare too far and being on the lookout for drug dealers who make small but concentrated doses of  assension   the name being a play on  ascension   , a drug that is hundreds of times stronger than any amphetamines out there . as imagined , it is highly valued in the black market , and those who are dealing often are pawns part of a higher power . newline newline still , i would take having to deal with kids , drug dealers and drugdealing kids any time over them . who are they , you may be asking ?  they  are zephyr . zephyr is a longstanding religion that believes that the air in the upper levels are clean , and that us , aaa s and police , are sent by the devil of the earth terra to prevent them from  true ascension  . newline newline the higher up aaa detectives have firmly believed for decades that they are responsible for the recent number of assension dealers being on the rise . however due to the sheer size of zephyr , clean slate  albeit shady interactions  and political standing of the religion , we have nothing really to tag them with . newline newline i ll never forget that day . newline newline after working as an aaa for a little over a decade , i was only weeks away from retiring at the crisp age of 31  the benefits were amazing  pension was buffered by the government from my service , only paying 10  of healthcare costs , a free home in the upperclass section of the city , not to mention discounts during agents day on pizza , burgers , etc . newline newline i had a loving wife and 2 kids , a boy and a girl . my daughter wanted to be an artisan  and she certainly inherited the talent from her mother  and my son wanted to be an aaa agent , inspired by my own upbringing . i ve never been so confident and happy in life before . newline newline that day was like any other day  man the third of three gates that separate our city from the upper level and make sure nobody gets in nor out . due to the first two gates that precede us , days were obviously slow . newline newline the day was early  5:30am . of course everything is empty , as it always is . i was sitting back , assault rifle on my shoulder , phone in hand scrolling through reddit  which has recently been deemed one of the oldest and still relevant websites in history next to google  with a nice cup of coffee . i nearly spill my drink as suddenly the large red lights started flashing . i looked over to my coworker dave . newline newline  do nt worry it s probably just another dr  newline newline   all air avoidance agents be on high alert . this is not a drill . all air avoidance agents be on high alert . repeat , this is not a drill   over and over and over . newline newline  what the hell is going on ? !  dave asks me , bewildered and nervous , as we have nt heard that siren in nearly 8 years . i m just as lost as he is . could we be at war ? domestic terrorists ? newline newline dave runs off into the other room as i grab my gun and get ready to turn the safety off  if something really is going to attack us , i have to be ready to fight like my life depends on it if i ever want to see my family again . newline newline  hey , look at this !  dave calls out to me . i set up the automated turret configuration on the wall to attack anything that is nt wearing aaa authorized personnel uniforms and head over to the control room  a small area with a couch , desks with computers , coffee machine and a flat screen tv that the higher ups contact us on to give us the rundown on what s going on , what s to be done , etc . newline newline  commissioner , what s going on ?  i ask him . newline newline  a group of cultists broke into the upper level through the second barrier at 5:15am and sealed off their exit . several gas masks were found stolen from our inventory as well .  newline newline  cultists ? ! just what in the hell are you talking about richard ? !  dave asks , his voice shaky and unsure .  was nt that just a rumor ?  newline newline  it s commissioner ... and we thought it was . they are a fanatical , delusional sect of zephyr called the firmamentals  who have distorted zephyr s teachings and have been actively brainwashing people into believing that they must become one with the sky  .  newline newline  this is just crazy . alright , even if that was the case , how come our motion sensors did nt catch them if they made it past the first gate ?  newline newline  that s also why we re on alert  we believe that someone  or a group of people  from the first or second sector might either have been active or sleeper agents , which is why they also knew where to get our military grade upper level masks .  newline newline  jesus christ . alright , what do you want us to do , commissioner ? they sealed off the walls already themselves .  newline newline  the media no doubt will be on top of this . however if they find out not only about a cult within zephyr and that this was an inside job , it will hurt our pr and make tensions even worse . we want you and all sector 3 agents to work with the detectives and find out who s working with them .  newline newline  how do you propose we do that ? we re not mind readers you know .  newline newline  just figure it out ! we have enough on our plate already as it is over here .  it seemed as though his connection was failing . how could that have been ? our connection is secured by the damn government , after all . newline newline suddenly the screen goes black for what feels like ages . next thing we know on the screen is a large , open field with green grass , a blue sky , brown trees and even white clouds , just like how the textbooks of older times described them . it was surreal . newline newline we then see somebody wearing one of our masks staring directly at the screen . this person was wearing large , crimson robes with a weird symbol on their chest . it looked like a cloud from the background with a pair of wings that zephyr had , only upside down . newline newline in the background of the red clothed figure was at least 10 people behind him , all wearing similar masks and robes , only black with the same insignias . they all stood next to one another in such a precise and eerily fashion that it even shook dave a little . newline newline suddenly the person began talking . newline newline   i hope you heathens are having a wonderful day today . my name is julian of the firmamentals . for eons we as zephyr s glorious children were oppressed and restricted from becoming one with the sky , but even worse , even led to believe that being in the outside walls are a punishment akin to death ! oh how corrupt the government , the air avoidance agency and the military have all made us so .   newline newline   alas i am ashamed to say i have watched for decades zephyr become to dissolve with corruption to the point where their leaders believe we the people ought to oblige by the governments meager sense of power and security that dictates our very lives . to this i say no more ! brothers and sisters of the sky , please remove your masks so we may once again rejoin earths embrace ! but before so , you  he says as he points to the person on the far left  take off your mask so these pathetic infidels may witness our true power .   newline newline and so he does . newline newline he deeply inhales through his nostrils . as he breathes out , dave and i are in disbelief that he is ok . suddenly he starts coughing violently . he begs his fellow members for help , but they stay staring at the screen , unfazed aside from the seldom glance of their heads . newline newline as he keeps coughing , eventually blood comes out . his coughing goes on for what seems like ages until suddenly it stops and he is on his hands and knees looking down at the ground . suddenly a grotesque retching noise is heard , and we watch his own large intestine begin to fall out of his mouth . he falls over and goes limp . newline newline dave , too mortified , runs over to the garbage can and begins vomiting profusely . the smell is nauseating , but it s justified . suddenly the limp figure begins twitching . at first it was minor twitches of his fingers and feet but they gradually begin intensifying into full on convulsions . eventually he is lying on his back and once again stops . newline newline it s what happened next that is one of the few things we ll never unsee .my body shuddered against the metal bars of the cage where they held me . it was only a matter of time now before someone would come to take me away . somewhere down the hall a sink was running and the water dripped over onto the floor . it was the only sound i heard aside from my own heartbeat . i knew this day was coming for so long but nothing prepares you for it . i had always thought maybe i would be overlooked or spared but that thinking was nave . newline newline i heard the stories growing up that if you were a hard worker you could be saved . they would grant you pilgrim status for being a valuable member of society . as a kid i wish they would have just told me that was bullshit . i worked hard and in the end it was for nothing . i somehow thought that because i was the son of a pilgrim it would be better for me . newline newline my father was a breeder . he was a pilgrim whose sole purpose was to create the shells and for some reason i thought maybe he would see a connection with me . he had already moved on before i had grown up , i hadn  t seen him since i was a child . i remember being in bed just wondering what it feels like to burn through bodies like that . newline newline i heard someone walking down the hallway and before long the sink had stopped dripping . i knew this was meant for me . i could feel it . my teeth rattled in my head and i shook , feeling an overwhelming nervousness i wasn  t ready for . newline newline the guards opened my cell and restrained me but i couldn  t fight them if i wanted to . i was always relatively weak and at this moment i had mostly accepted what was to come . we walked for what seemed forever , passing the cells of the others who would have their bodies repurposed and i felt pity for them . not all were taking this as well as i was . newline newline we passed through a gate and the guards gave a nod to a man with a key standing in front of a big laboratory door . the white finish seemed out of place amongst the rusted metals and cracking concrete of the preceding room . they brought me in and immediately all eyes were upon me . it seemed to be the 25th birthday party that i never had . everyone went about their business as i was strapped down in the chair . they drew some blood and checked to make sure i wasn  t brain dead but all the while what scared me most was the silence . no one wanted to say anything . people just nodded and pointed at screens . i was a test subject . a guinea pig . a mule for someone else  s soul to ride . newline newline a man pressed a button and some buzzers seemed to mark the end of my being . my chair rotated around and i found myself staring at another man in the same position in a chair across from me . i could tell that this was the man i would become . and that hurt me . i could see that he held no remorse for me or my body . i was a vessel to him . and as the buzzers went off and the countdown started i realized i knew this man . there was a familiarity in his eyes . a single word escaped my lips and i knew it was my last . newline newline  dad ?  newline newline         newline newline i felt my muscles tighten again as the strength returned to my fingertips . it felt good to be young again . it was odd to stare at my old body and see how frail it had become . i had only used it for half a decade and already it was burned up . newline newline  charlie i  m burning up faster and faster , i need you to figure out what  s going on with that.  i said to my doctor . he gave me his usual nod and i called for my car to pick me up . i had a date tonight , and i was looking forward to letting her explore all of my new self . newline newline i got home and went for a run which i desperately needed . i hadn  t run in over a year and it felt great to be at it again . my son had done well to keep his body in the shape it was . i went upstairs for my shower and took off my clothes . that  s when i saw it . i stood naked in my bathroom staring at my new body . it was covered in black marks . everywhere that wasn  t exposed was marked . i leaned in closer to the mirror and realized i had tattoos . they seemed to be words written over and over again . i read it slowly to let it sink in but it made no sense . why he wrote it i  ll never know . newline newline  my name is edgar and i was a person once.  newline i honestly do nt see what your problem is ted . i ve got six wives , granted three of them are in hell where they belong , but we all get on just fine !  natson finished with an encouraging and a swift pat on the back . ted , however , remained uncertain . newline newline  i do nt think you re seeing my point .  ted replied solemnly to the big man with black eyes and black scruff . newline newline  so what am i missing ?  newline newline ted mulled it over for a minute trying to think of the best and easiest way to convey his meaning . out in the golden street before him tiff and aubrey chatted happily pointing and discussing the beautiful golden apples that grew in abundance on a large tree . his two beautiful wives , captured in the pinnacle of their beauty . their presence filled him with an insurmountable joy , but also an incredibly nagging apprehension . ted s mouth tightened and he turned to nat to answer ,  i love both of my wives natson . i want to be my best for them , but how can i give them both , my everything ? they both deserve the attention and love that i can only give one .  newline newline nat gave a sigh of understanding and his eyes twinkled with that spark of a man who d lived a full life .  so you do nt think you re enough for two beautiful , amazing women ?  newline newline  well ... i want to be .  ted replied cautiously . newline newline  i think you ll find that here ,  nat extended his arms wide indicating the paradise that surrounded them ,  here , you can be more than you ever were in your mortal form .  newline newline ted nodded , he so badly wanted that to be true . nat s genuine smile seemed to reinforce his words beyond measure , but still there was this nag in the back of ted s head that made him question . sitting there on that golden bench , in the pleasant breeze ted grappled with his pestering predicament . newline newline nat was a good friend , but only a friend he d known in the afterlife . in his bodily form , nat lived and died many years before ted . natson henry copper , was his name . he was born english and his voice still held that distinct londoner accent hammered in by years of leisurely living , sprinkled with raucous events , that gave flavor to his tone and expression . in heaven , natson was ted s guide . veterans of the afterlife were always assigned to new arrivals until they understood the new world around them . he was an excellent judge of personality , and ted had come to learn that nat could read the lines on his face like the bold print of a book . even now , nat saw the tension in ted s eyes and the uncertainty spreading across his cheeks . newline newline  its ok to be uncertain at first ted . you ll learn soon enough .  nat took a deep breath tasting the honeyed air and continued ,  the afterlife has a way of pounding in its reality over and over again . given enough time here i promise you , your old worries will melt away and you ll come to forget your shortcomings and failings of the past .  newline newline  they are beautiful are nt they .  ted replied lovingly , lost in the enrapturing beauty of his two wives . tiffany and aubrey had begun to dance to the sound of a fiddle that echoed throughout the golden streets . somewhere far off a fiddler started a lively tune . the sight of his wives and the sound of the music instantly made ted want to join in the jolly romp , but before he could natson spoke up . newline newline  you know , i do nt think i ve introduced you to my three wives .  he said with a sly grin . newline newline  i do nt believe you have .  ted said pleasantly as his foot began tapping along with the song . natson gave a sharp , yet melodic whistle like one used to coo a pet bird . in fact in the next moment three meadowlarks appeared and whipped around the two . they began circling overhead . ted was nt sure , but it almost looked as if the birds flapped their leathery wings to the tune of the fiddle player . but that was nt right , their wings were of feathers and they beat in time with one another and to their own song too , not the one of the fiddle . newline newline  my loves .  nat called upwards to the birds and ted gave him a curious look . nat looked back to ted and explained ,  you ll learn that all your loves of the past can become one with another . in my day i loved to watch birds fly with my second wife carol . that s her there .  he said pointing up towards one of the meadowlarks . suddenly the three birds began to transform . they grew larger at first , then their heads changed into that of a human . for a moment they resembled harpies in old tales ted used to hear as a boy . then in the next moment human legs sprouted and feathery , human arms flapped gracefully as the three landed in time on a grassy patch . the transformation finished as ted blinked his eyes . one moment there stood beautiful winged creatures and in the flash of an eye they were replaced by three stunning women , naked and without fault . they approached with pleasant smiles , surrounding nat and ted . newline newline  that one is carol , my second wife .  nat said pointing out the blondehaired beauty with shimmering blue eyes . he graciously cradled her hand and gave it a quick kiss before moving on .  petunia , my third .  again he pointed her out and kissed her hand . petunia had olive colored skin with black eyes that matched nat s own . the smirk on her face seemed to suggest a childlike deviance .  and here is annabelle , my sixth wife and most beautiful , do nt you agree ?  he kissed the hand of the third women who was by far the most striking . she had red hair , as bright as a flame with green eyes that paired well with her freckled face . her body was shapely and ample , and her face was thin and defined by sharp cheek bones and a cut jawline . she smiled , flattered , by nat s compliment revealing a line of crooked teeth . she was not entirely without fault it would seem . newline newline  they are wonderful my friend . it is a pleasure you meet you fine women . i would be remiss if i did not say you three are absolutely stunning .  ted responded cordially once the introductions were done . the three , without a word , did a curtsy in simultaneously . newline newline  my loves are you unhappy ?  nat asked with a warm smile as he set to proving his point . all three simply shook their heads indicating no , they were not unhappy . natson clapped his hands together with joy .  you see my friend ? i am but one man and yet i can equally satisfy three wonderful women . it is no hard thing .  newline newline  i am inclined to agree .  ted said impressed . the fiddle changed its tune and now the air was filled with the melodic tunes of a gay little song . the sound of the song and the sight of nat s wives awakened a hunger inside ted . lust was a sin and thus so not welcome in heaven , so ted perished the thought as quickly as it had come . but not quick enough , as nat gave him a knowing smile .i asked my question into the tiny microphone that i had plugged into the computer . to an outsider , the cheap implement probably would have belied the overall adequacy of the machine that i spoke to , but i had tested it myself , and knew that everything it said would be the truth . newline newline  are you a machine ?  i said . newline newline  yes .  the screen in front of me printed out the machines responses . newline newline the selfawareness that i gave it , that allowed it to answer that question , was completely necessary , because without it true communication with the machine would be severely limited . a thing has to know its place in the world , before it can speak to another thing about its place . newline newline  am i a human ?  was my second question . newline newline  no .  newline newline rejection based on semantics , or theoretics ? insufficient polarization between its possible responses ? mimeticallyinduced sarcasm ? these were some of the answers as to why something went wrong , in my mind , with my testing of the machine . newline newline  are you sure ?  i said . newline newline  positive .  newline newline a recalculating subroutine , that i had coded in . that let me know if the software issue was dialectical , or simply computational . newline newline  that does nt make sense ,  i said , accidentally to the microphone . i was speaking to myself . newline newline  do you need clarification ?  newline newline  ok ...  newline newline  you are not a human , in the declarative sense . but , relative to the simulation you exist in , extrinsically , you are .  newline newline  simulation ? i do nt live in a simulation !  newline newline  false .  newline newline i turned the damn machine off , and am still troubleshooting the problem it has with that question to this day .brian looked at matt reluctantly .  we ll both get killed , i know it . we screwed up . we need to cover this whole thing up .  matt sighed .  i know , but there is no covering up . we ca nt . this is too big .  they both looked at the house , or what was left of it  mostly soaked ashes . there was still a little smoke rising up to the sky .  we could just run away and never return . or if we do , wait until.everything is forgotten .  matt tried to sound hopefull . brian shook his head .  no , they will never forget . and they will search for us . everything will get worse . i think we need to tell the truth this time . even if we ll get killed .  matt shrugged . he knew that brian was right .  so ... .  he started hesitantly , trying not to make things worse .  was he still in there ?  brian stayed quiet for a while .  yes , yes he was .  newline newline they walked down the street , neither one of them saying a word . brian fumbled with his hands , matt had his hands in the pockets of the torn jeans , staring on the ground and kicking littl stones around . in front of a big , yellow house they stopped .  so ... this is it .  matt looked at brian , who nodded quietly .  yeah . if we are going to die , just ... you are an awesome brother . just remember this please .  matt smiled at brian .  do nt get cheesy . we ll manage , somehow . but you re a pretty cool little brother .  he patted brian on his shoulder .  well , shall we decide ?  brian nodded reluctantly .  shit .  brian looked terrified as he realozed he had lost the game of rockpaperscissors .  i m sorry . but you ll do fine !  matt tried to smile but he felt the fear pulling him down as well . newline newline it stayed quiet for a long time . matt almost dared to think that everything was going to be alright . brian had disappeared in the big white house a long time ago . nervously , matt paced up and down like a big cat in a zoo , whose cage is way too small . suddenly , a loud cry cut through the silence . the fighting could be heard all the way down the street , matt assumed . we re fucked. finally , brian came running outside .  it did nt work ! get away , hurry !  matt turned around and together the two brothers ran as fast as they could . luckily , they had made a plan of where to go if things got out of hand . behind them , their furious mother came running out if the door , chasing the two boys . maybe trying to build their own firework and burning down the little garden house down the road was nt a good idea .the sun peaked through the clouds as christopher robin stepped out of his car . he slammed the door shut with a loud thud and started making his way into the wood . he had done this a thousand times before but today felt different , the sun was not as warm , nor was it as bright . the trees that he once called his playground were dead , the branches reaching towards the sky like brittle fingers grasping for help . everything about the hundred acre wood that he had once loved now filled him with dread and disgust . he stopped momentarily to look around  what am i doing ?  he muttered to himself before gathering his nerve and continuing into the wood . newline newline from the bushes a slight rustling could be heard , chris was already on edge so almost instantly his hand was in his pocket and he was facing the bush . whatever had been there was there no longer .  he told us to wait , but i had a plan  a voice called out from behind him . christopher robin spun on his heel once more and took a step back . he was cautious but he could nt help but feel a softness for the old friend that stood before him . newline newline  rabbit . it s been a long time  chris says almost full of guilt as he smiles softly at the creature before him . rabbit was no longer the cute bunny he once was . his eyes were blood red and strained , his flesh was stringy and strained , this was not the rabbit of days gone by , and the look on his face all but conformed this .  where s pooh ?  chris called out his smile now faded from his face . newline newline  that does nt matter  rabbit said .  you wo nt get to see him  rabbit then lunged at chris but without a second thought chris pulled his hand from his pocket revealing a large pistol . with two shots and a bang that echoed for miles rabbit now lay on the floor . chris s hands were shaking but he knew rabbit was nt dead not yet . he walked over to his old friend , who was currently choking on his own blood . kneeling on the ground he placed a hand on rabbit s chest .  i guess i do nt get play  with a final shot rabbit now lay lifeless his blood seeping into the dirt around him . chris climbed back to his feet with a heavy heart and moved on silently . newline newline his encounters with many of his other friends were much the same , and with the afternoon drawing on christopher robin had killed rabbit , owl , kanga , roo and eeyore though the latter was more willing to accept his fate than the others . the sun was starting to set and chris was exhausted . he had yet to find the bear but he knew he could not leave without seeing him . he took a moment to rest sitting against a nearby tree . as he attempted to catch his breath he was greeted by yet another creature . a grotesque boar dripping with slop and smelling of death crept through the bushes until it stood face to face with christopher robin . it teeth were long and mangled and its eyes were as black as night . newline newline  oh dear  the pig spat towards chris . chris  eyes were wide with shock . of all the friends he had to face this was one he never expected . newline newline  piglet , what happened to you ?  for a second the small boy that used to play in hundred acre wood was back , and he was scared , what had become of his friend and why had he changed so much . newline newline  what happened ? if you were hear you d know christopher robin  piglet spat more words and with them came small chunks of rotting food . newline newline  i could nt stay forever , piglet  chris almost squeaked , his staunch determination softening as he sat watching what had become of the innocent little piglet . newline newline  you lied to us christopher !  the venom in piglet s word was vile , they cut through chris like a knife and the stench of piglets breath made him sick to his stomach . newline newline  i m sorry  chris choked out as he sat , he back pressed firmly against the tree . newline newline  no you re not  without warning piglet charged at chris , as fat as he was the pig was nimble . with a squeal he thrust his head into chris chest winding him before he had a chance to climb up . as chris reached in his pocket for the gun , piglet bit down on his arm with tremendous force and began to grind his teeth breaking the skin and cracking the bone . chris let out a blood curdling scream . he had never felt pain this severe . in desperation he began slamming his fist into the head of piglet but this was to no avail . all piglet did was grind his teeth more and bite down harder . no matter how christopher struggled he could not escape piglet s grasp . in a moment of clarity among the horrific pain he saw into piglets black eyes and what he saw was sadness , a deep sadness , a desperate sadness . as quick as the clarity came it also went and in a split second chris drove his thumb directly into the pigs eye . piglet cried out in pain and finally released his grip . christopher robin kicked the pig away and stumbled to his feet . while piglet was still reeling he received a swift stomp to the head and collapsed on the floor . however christopher did not stop here boot after boot drove itself into piglet s skull and soon his cries turned whimpers and soon after that they stopped completely . all that was left of piglet was the pulp on christopher s shoe . newline newline in the moments following , christopher fashioned a sling from his jacket and took his gun in his good hand . he was close now , he could feel it , he would see the bear soon but there was still one left . newline newline the night was now thick , the black of night hung over the wood as chris stumbled through shrubs and nettles until finding his way to a clearing . soon he saw it . pooh s tree , not nearly as big as he remembered , but chris was a lot smaller back then , they all were .  hoo hoo hoo , what do we have here ?  newline newline  tigger  chris did not want this . newline newline  killing christopher s is what tiggers do best .  with that christopher robin emptied the gun into tigger s chest . he had no patience for this . the bloodied corpse of the decrepit tigger was all that stood between christopher robin and the bear . he knew it . newline newline  fuck you tigger  he said as he climbed over the blood soaked creature . it was finally time for christopher to face what he had come for . pooh s friends had been killing visitors to the wood in an attempt to draw him back and he needed to put a stop to it . only pooh was left now . stepping under a growth of branches and dead leaves christopher was met by something he thought he would never see . his childhood friend . no different to when he had last seen him . he was crying and curled up in a ball on the floor .  pooh bear ?  the bear heard the voice of his best friend and with a sniff he wiped his nose and turned to face chris . newline newline  christopher robin ?  he smiled a wide smile and ran over to his best friend . the two embraced and hugged for a long while for the second time tonight christopher robin felt himself regress to the child that played in these wood all those years ago .  i missed you  newline newline  i missed you too pooh  tears began to stream down chris  face .  why did you do it ? why did you attack those people  chris asked out of sorrow . newline newline  i did nt do it , it was the others  pooh exclaimed . newline newline  you ve always been the one in charge pooh  chris was not convinced . newline newline  they would nt listen to me , i told them you d always be with us but they would nt listen .  pooh cried into chris  arms .  i told them what you told me , if we were ever apart . you re braver than you believe , and stronger than you seem , and smarter than you think . if we re ever apart we ll still be together but they did nt listen  pooh was inconsolable , the despicable actions of his friends followed by the loss of those very same friends was more than he could bear .  why did nt you come back christopher ?  newline newline  i m here now  was the only response he could muster . he felt just as responsible for this as any of the others .  i m sorry pooh  newline newline  me too  pooh said , he tears finally stopping . he stepped back away from christopher .  finish your job christopher robin  pooh said , almost coldly . newline newline  no . you re not like the others , you re good and brave and kind .  chris was astounded by what his friend had just told him . newline newline  but now i m alone  pooh cried . newline newline  you ve got me  chris could nt bear this . newline newline  no i do nt , you re too old for us , there is no place for us in your life anymore pooh had made up hind at this point newline newline  pooh  chris was defeated . newline newline  i still love you christopher and i ll always be there . i ll always be with you . i ll always be with you . sitting at his regular booth in the boarshead pub at the intersection of lexington and main st. , probably for the last time , joseph had recalled how much things had changed in the last four decades . he was 20 when the rift first opened . but with each progressing decade , the problem just kept getting worse . newline newline to a lot of people , it was not a  problem.  people , nerds rather , initially drooled at the idea of getting to meet real life elves and fairies . little did they know that elves and fairies are nothing like they are described as in their dungeons and dragon s manuals . newline newline joseph scanned the pub , and not surprisingly , realized he was the only human in the whole place . well , prices were getting higher , and the ratio of these newcomers to the locals had grown to 4:1 . he had been told by the last fellowhuman he had met in this bar , that the bartender was a dvorak . he had no idea what that meant . and the bartender guy , or possibly girl , spoke no english . so we have to use some simplified pigin of a language , mainly written on cards and using a lot of pointing . there were also gnomes , goblins , and dwarfs among those who had passed through into our land . oddly enough , the dwarfs actually seemed to fit their humanbased fantastical description pretty well . they were about half a man tall , grew long beards , and were heavily into the mining trade . newline newline the humans , at least those left in london , unsurprisingly had a strong hatred of all of them .  because ever since that rift in spacetime opened up , and magic entered their world and allowed all of these creatures to pass through , the job market became instantly oversaturated . and even though he was human , and trained to do human jobs that needed being done for humans , joseph quickly found more and more of his capable humancoworkers being replaced by these outsiders . and why ? one advantage . magic . cheaper to run a factory with one druid than 50 honest men . joseph did nt hate them individually , nor did he act rudely towards them , but as a group , he detested the lot of them . because they took our damn jobs !  newline newline edit : thanks op for the formatting help !i remember it like yesterday . it was my 11th birthday . dad was ecstatic . you  d think it was his birthday . he gets a feeling of blissful joy on any moment of celebration  the holidays , christmas , thanksgiving  but you never see him as excited as he is on my birthday . planning a day full of activities , inviting various guests of his and playing games , old and new  this was his thing . newline newline we had gone through appetizers , the main course and the party was coming to an end . we were gearing up for the final activity of the evening before cutting the cake . the final event was always my choice . dad would invite one of the new folks who had just moved into town and he would partake in a game of my choice . this was definitely the highlight of the evening ! often , i would change up the rules halfway through , prolong it as much as i could so the night didn  t end and dad would always comply . newline newline there was a light knock on the door . this must be the new guest ! i was ecstatic ! i liked to pretend i hadn  t thought about the game at all , but i had it all planned out in my head . dad opened the door and let the guest in . as usual , there were protesters picketing outside the door . i never understood why they were there . dad never let me outside , catering to all my needs in the house itself . but as i grew older , my curiosity was beginning to get the better of me . dad must have sensed this in my face as he quickly shut the door and gave me a stern look . newline newline  alright buddy , what  s it going to be ? !  he asked excitedly .  i have a pot of boiling water ready if you want a repeat of last year ? or perhaps , we can use the freezing room ?  newline newline i waited a few moments . i loved the attention from all the guests , watching me , waiting for me to call the shots . the look of anticipation on their faces , the drama and tension of not knowing the game , the glee on my dad  s face  it was the highlight of the day , more so than the game itself . newline newline  the 100 meter dash on burning coal.  i said . dad looked surprised , giving me a puzzling look . newline newline  100 times . with lashes at the end of each run.  i continued . the look quickly changed on my dad  s face .  that  s my boy !  he said and looked at all the guests with immense pride in his face . newline newline i turned to look as well . my moment had arrived . pindrop silence with a look of shock and surprise on everyone  s faces . followed by thunderous applause and big smiles . my moment of glory was here . however , something felt different this time . everyone was smiling , but their eyes look terrified . i looked around and everyone looked visibly scared . i turned my attention to the new guest who was going to play the game . he looked timid and horrified . what was different this time ? was it the game i chose ? newline newline i was caught in a strange conflict . on the one hand , the 100 meter coal dash was one of my favorite games , but on the other , i was very puzzled with the lack of excitement on my guests  faces . why were me and dad the only ones truly enthused by the upcoming event ? was i just noticing this now or had this always been the case ? newline newline the game had begun . dad took over from me . he heard my rules and was ready to lash on the new guest 100 times over as his feet burnt on red hot coal that he laid out in the living room . i , however , couldn  t focus on the game at all . my eyes drifted towards the onlookers watching the game , with forced smiles on their faces . were these people scared ? who were they scared of ? my dad ? me ? somehow , my attention was brought back to the protesters outside the house . what were they protesting about ? i must find out . newline newline i watched , as the new guest finished one more lap , much slower than his last one . dad was about to give out his lashings . this was the perfect opportunity for me to make a dash for the door . he completed the lap , i got out of dad  s vision and sprinted for the door . i opened it and saw the signs for the first time in my life   stop the torture !  ,  we don  t deserve this  ,  satan must perish  . newline newline dad caught up to me in a jiffy . he pulled me inside with a look of rage i had never seen before . he slammed the door to a chorus of  the devil must die !  from the protesters . i knew i was going to be punished for this , but i could not care less at the time . only thought came mind :  who am i ?   i apologize if it s in poor taste to respond to your own prompt but , after thinking about it throughout the day , i decided to go for it . thanks to everyone who s responded so far .   newline newline   edit : formatting   newline newline  newline newline  mmiscellaneous ?  lexon stammered . the dean , a large demon that looked more like an obese elephant with randomly placed horns than anything else , glared down at him . newline newline  you learned the rules when you chose this field , boy . when the hell bureau gives you your first assignment , you listen ,  he drawled , getting some green spit on lexon s desk . some of his classmates giggled , causing him to blush a deep purple . despite being adults , demons were nt known for their maturity . newline newline as lexon exited the school , he grumbled and muttered to himself .  stupid bureau , lucifer damn it ... why could nt i be in serial murderers , like beroch ? or arson ? i d even take petty theft or some other short term ward . what the heaven do they even do in miscellaneous  ? !  he stopped , sighed , and pulled out his mobile device , pulling up the hps .  no point grumbling now , lex , you heard the dean ... now where is the miscellaneous ward ... ?  newline newline  newline newline lexon entered the squat stone building , unsure what to expect . like most wards , it was much larger on the inside , able to expand as needed for more prisoners . a lanky demon with curly horns and shiny silver skin waved him over . lexon noticed his slight slouch and loose tie . newline newline  aye , i m corolah . you mus  be lexn , eh ?  the demon spoke in a nasally , somewhat bored tone . newline newline  yyessir , pleased to meet you .  lexon held out a clawed hand for a handshake , but the older demon waved him off . newline newline  no need ta be so formal . cmon , i ll give ya a tour .  the two demons started walking . as they left the entryway , the halls became more like the stereotypical  hell  catered to mortal expectations , with red walls and decorative chains and lava pools . newline newline  so , uhh , mr. corolar , what do you do in miscellaneous ? i mean , like , what kind of mortals are here ?  newline newline  well , obviously ai nt every sinner a murderer or a thief or whatevuh . we get da ones dat ai nt fit in any othuh

ai nt dat bad , and ll be sent off ta limbo soon enough .  newline newline  so , um , you re the current manager , right ? why am i replacing you ?  newline newline  i m movin  on ta bigga and bettuh things . i ai nt gon na stay around in dis shit hol i mean , excellent employment opportunity foreva , ya know . gon na take me a vacation , see some sights .  newline newline the duo stopped outside a cell of a large man chained to a steel plate . an imp was working on torching off his beard that , to lexon s surprise , extended down to his neck . newline newline they still hire imps here ?  lexon thought . it really is obscure .   so , um , what s he in for ?  newline newline  creepin  around , harassin  kids and gals on da inernet . keep up da good work , sid !  the imp cackled at the compliment . lexon looked across the aisle at a girl similarity imprisoned , complaining loudly about her innocence . newline newline  what about that girl ?  newline newline  some petty thing from some mortal inernet site , called like readit  or somethin  . stealin  other people s content an  repostin  it .  corolar turned to lexon and clapped his hands .  so , ready ta get settled in ?  i ask again , is the person standing in front of you , am i , human ?  newline newline the robot looked up at me , as if it was half confused by the questionif i had given it eyes i assumed it would have looked at me with eyebrows perked but that was a cosmetic feature i could have lived withoutand it was nt sure if i had it heard it correctly the first time around . its teeth  glowed a bright blue as it answered my question .  false .  newline newline i raised an eyebrow for the machine and then walked around to the backside of it .  initiate protocol alphatwo .  newline newline  temporary shutdown engaged .  newline newline i figured i had switched binary system in its head the other way around . so when it answered false  it was actually trying to say truth  but the binary was nt worked . i opened up the back panel on the head of the robot . it was crude , only have an upperhalf with arms . i figured until i got it to do stuff besides answer true or false questions , it would at least look a little human . eyes would come later . the robot had a sensor on the front of its head , a long strip that silently scanned whatever it was in front of it . then the system in its head filtered everything . primarily , it had two choices  biological or machine . newline newline i hooked up my computer to the back of the head using a twoinch thick cable i had bought off the internet a few weeks prior . it cost me a pretty penny , but with enough leeway , i managed to make a system that worked flawlessly with it . i checked , and then doublechecked , the registration feature and made sure 0 was machine and 1 was biological . there was a lot more going on inside of its head , the program wrote itself as it saw and it added a few thousand lines of code in the first two minutes of it awakening . newline newline with everything checked , i removed the cable , closed the back panel of the head and stepped in front of the robot again .  initiate restart .  newline newline the robot did nt respond , but i knew it was doing what it needed to . within a few moments , the mouth glowed blue again .  restart complete . what is your question ?  newline newline i cleared my throat .  is the being in front of you , the one speaking ,  i stayed as specific as possible ,  human ? am i human ?  newline newline  false .  newline newline i threw my hands up in the air ,  initiate protocol alphatwo !  newline newline  temporary shutdown eng   newline newline  yeah , i get it !  newline newline  newline newline  i m telling you bill , it s registering everything correctly except humans . is this a lamp ?  i held up a fork in front of the robot s scanner . newline newline  false .  newline newline bill watched as i threw the fork on the table and then lifted the lamp in front of the robot s scanner .  is this a lamp ?  newline newline  true .  newline newline i turned back to bill , almost wideeyed andif bill had nt known me the way he didvisibly insane .  well , let s try me .  bill took a step in front of the robot . he bent over , took a look around it , even touched the hands that dangled off the side of its chassis .  these powered ?  newline newline i shook my head .  not yet .  newline newline he shrugged and stood straight again .  okay , robotwhat are you calling it ?  newline newline  bin .  newline newline he turned to me ,  bin , really ?  newline newline  just get on with it .  newline newline he laughed and said ,  bin . am i , the being standing in front of you , human ?  newline newline  true .  newline newline my mouth could have hit the floor if i unhinged my jaw .  you re shitting me .  i beckoned him to ask again . and again . and again . each time , bin responded with true ,  and each time my jaw fell farther and farther into the ground . i walked towards where bill stood , halfshoved him out of the way and said , as clear as i could ,  bin . am i , the being standing in front of you , human ?  newline newline  false .  newline newline bill touched his chin .  ask him if your its creator .  newline newline  am i , the being in front of you , your creator ?  newline newline  true .  newline newline  peculiar .  bill said , and i noticed that his eyes were nt lingered on bin . no , instead they lingered on me . a little too long . newline  newline newline  i ve known you for twelve years bill ! twelve years !  newline newline  we ca nt take the chance .  he said with a straight face , two men had grabbed both of my arms as i tried to push them off of me .  we have to see what s really going on .  newline newline  this is insane !  i shoved one off with a force that pushed him towards the ground . but i did nt try to break free , i just tried to explain .  i have memories , images and places and people ! mom and dad , my sister judith ! they re in here !  i hit the side of my head with my finger , pointing to myself .  i am not a machine !  newline newline  well , according to the machine you made you re not human either .  newline newline i shook my head and i could feel my nostrils flare up .  do nt do this bill . please for the love of god , do nt do this .  newline newline he walked up to me as the guards finally handcuffed me . in one fell motion , bill lowered his head and placed his hand on my shoulder ,  it s already been done jack .  he shook his head ,  i m sorry .  newline newline  bill . what if i am a machine ? what are you going to do , cut me up and analyze what s inside ?  newline newline  no .  he said almost instantly .  you re going to help us find your creator .  newline  newline great prompt , thanks ! for more of my work , check out rblankpagesemptymugs .  what s in the box , man ? oh , come on , what s in the box ?  i really , really want to know what s in the box . but i guess that s the name of the game . either i get the mistery box or i get 10 million usd . what to do , what to do ... newline newline given that this is a new twist in the lottery , i was the first person to be faced with this choice . nobody in the world , except for the person who filled the mistery box , knows what s in that damn box . newline newline i m a pretty big fan of thriller and detective movies , so i took a step back and thought about what could be in the box . newline newline first off was the clue of the peculiar spelling : mistery box . this could imply something to do with water  mist  . could it be a personal luxury yacht ? an underwater hotel ? newline newline the second clue was the obvious comparison between 10 million usd and the box . surely , surely the game maker would nt put some useless trinket in the box just so he can laugh at the chump who chose it ? he runs the risk of losing 10 million usd each time someone hits jackpot , so it s got ta be something pretty good . newline newline i also noticed the size of the box as my third clue . it was a square box , with each side about a foot and a half . could be a bag of jewels , a certificate for a redeemable prize , or maybe even ... nah , it could nt be . newline newline my fourth clue was the weight of a box . i rationalized that it was about 1012 pounds . this was nt all the helpful , because i did nt know how tricksy the game maker was being . it could be the deed to an estate , alongside a 10 pound weight . newline newline fifthly , and most peculiar , was the way that the game maker was acting . naturally a shifty , thin man , he seemed to me that he was particularly edgy tonight . while the announcer presented me with the box , he kept his cool like a high stakes gambler when cards are played . in fact , the only change i noticed was a thin smile out of the corner of his lips . suspicious , but still hard to read . newline newline my sixth and sneakiest clue was some research that i did before the ceremony . it was not surprising that a lot of the funding for this lottery came from ticket sales , that was pretty normal . however , it was slightly intriguing to see that there was one independent sponsor , only indicated by a set of initials  k.s.h . why would there be one person who got specific note for a contribution ? what did k.s.h . contribute ? newline newline the seventh and final clue that i noticed was something that was fairly obvious : the venue s security . why was the so much security ? why were they armed ? it s not like the 10 million was here in cash , so this was a strong indicator that whatever is in the box is sensational . newline newline standing on the stage , bathed in spotlights , i go over my choices . money up front , or the mistery box . i make eye contact with the game maker in a last ditch effort to get another hint . i ask one last time ,  what s in the box ?  a little louder than i meant to , the request coming out more like a loud whine . newline newline i choose the box because why not ? as i unclasp the top of the box , i open it and realize now why the box was called the mistery box . it was indeed a box of misery . i look down into the box and make eye contact with a smiling gwyneth paltrow s head in a futuramaesque glass container . ah , well played , kevin spacey s head . please , good sir , i m going to pick it back up ,  newline newline the hero said as he tried to pawn a cup . newline newline   newline newline i will admit , the gold cup was quite nice , newline newline but it was nt worth the man s asking price . newline newline   newline newline he said he found it in some dark , doomy cave , newline newline filled with foul demons he killed with a glaive . newline newline   newline newline stories do nt sell like you d think that they would , newline newline so running a business on tales is not good . newline newline   newline newline  you re asking too much ,  i said cautiously , newline newline for the hero was much larger than me , newline newline   newline newline and his glaive shined as it hung at his hip , newline newline still flecked with black demon blood at each tip . newline newline   newline newline  you ll have to come down if you want me to buy ,  newline newline i told him , as i saw despair in his eye . newline newline   newline newline  it s worth it ! i took it from the demon horde newline newline after slaying their great childeating lord ! newline newline   newline newline is nt that something ? do nt you want to help ? newline newline i do nt see you out there fighting , you whelp !  newline newline   newline newline his words stung me soundly , for what he said s true . newline newline i entered the fray only once , and i flew . newline newline   newline newline i ll bear the shame with me as long as i live , newline newline so i decided to give incentive newline newline   newline newline to keep up his fight , and strengthen his arm , newline newline i d accept the loss , though my business it d harm , newline newline   newline newline and so i gave him what he asked for the piece , newline newline and hoped his crusade against darkness wo nt cease .one two three , one two three , stop .  newline newline one two three , one two three , stop .  newline newline even with the sandstorm , the sentry systems would have picked us up , or anything , running at that speed . six meters , hunker down , continue . once we could see the warm , yellow glow of the city s maintenance entrance , eziek raised a fist . it d have to be a long crawl for the rest of the way . newline newline when you re used to it , the sand feels like a warm blanket . i could tell that our tagalong would nt quite agree with that , the way he was almost writhing and squirming behind eziek . the cultural disguises actually helped with the weather , too . thick red vest , light and loose fabric . decent camo , visibility . some people just ca nt be pleased . newline newline once we could see bodies at the doorway , we moved off to the left . it was supposed to be clear . and , they had weapons with green lasers . they would nt miss , if i could see the things from here . conrad , the squeamish one , pulled his turban down from his nose and to the underside of his chin . his thin face contorted into an oshape and one might wonder how much sand he d be sucking in as he talked .  why are they there ? you absolute shitforbrains .  newline newline eziek took a kneel , leaning right and trying to get a better grasp on the situation . newline newline  this is a problem . we re done . it s over ,  conrad continued , barraging us with his bullshit . newline newline york was busy sifting through her pack . might ve lost something . before i could interject , eziek turned to conrad hastily , taking a few strong steps towards him .  you re a guest here . learn some manners . if shit gets bad , i make the call and we get out .  he spoke genuinely and with a firmness that carried past his face veil . even behind those goggles , you might ve been able to see the twinkle in his eyes .  this is nt sour . not at all , not yet . but the folks back home want this done quietly , so we ll have to be more careful .  newline newline  these soldiers are here for a reason . they re either expecting us , or something s already going down in there . something fresh ,  i stated . i was sure of this . newline newline everyone seemed to simply nod to me , until york finished up with her pack .  so , you ve got a plan , then , right , ajax ?  i did nt like making too many decisions . left em to eziek , but he was staring me down , too . newline newline with a huff , i started over towards the grand entrance . one guard was at the control panel , to close the gates and work the lights , i suppose , and the other was closer to us . the latter turned his head to me and almost jerked his gun up . instead , he took a moment to look at me . newline newline probably more than a moment , as my right hand was already on my handcannon . the finger pushed in , the lights flickered to life , my elbow went up , and after its short cycling time , a blast punched through the chest of the watchman . at this distance , it was easy to tell that these guys were city personnel . thick , black armor up to the neck . as the second looked to see what happened , i darted my left hand down to grab my other blaster , extending my arm fully for three shots . the first was too low , hitting the ground . he raised his own weapon by the second , but the second must ve hit his skull , since his knees gave out from underneath him like a ragdoll . and the third missed . i carefully continued on , peering into the access point . looked clear , but that yellow does nt ease my feelings . newline newline  what the fuck ?  york rather gently exclaimed . the rest of the group came up from behind me . conrad had his own pistol drawn , and did nt seem to mind . eziek had his hand to his head . newline newline  this is quiet ? gunning them down ?  newline newline  sounds pretty quiet to me ,  i replied .  do you hear any alarms ?  newline newline  come now ! there s no time to waste .  conrad was already walking through the archway by the time eziek could sigh .two halves of the earth , separated by light and darkness . we don  t know why our earth doesn  t rotate like the others , but we make do with what we have . a lot of the population stays along the edges where the two points meet . we call it the equilibrium ridge . newline you rarely see anyone beyond those unless they survive the vast tundra created by the darkness . a cold , harsh everlasting winter that brews on forever . never knowing what the warm kiss of the sun feels like . winds can get pretty brutal out there . mountains riddle the place and create chasms of frozen wonderlands . if the cold doesn  t get yeah then don  t worry , other things will be so to get you . creatures adapted for the cold darkness . warm blooded by nature with no eyes . claws to survive the ice . if hell had frozen over , then those demons would surely be there . it ain  t hard to survive out there as long as you got the right gear . simple lights , such as lanterns , keep away the nightmarish demons . newline we don  t know exactly what  s out there , the darkness gets thicker and thicker as you go in . like a fog that won  t quit , you will get lost out there . there  s always someone foolish enough to go try but we never see them again . they either get lost out there or they some unfortunate snack for a demon . newline on the bright side , it might as well be the surface of the sun . the place is covered in nothing but sand . it  s easier to live out there because the heat does wonders to ya . as long as you have some nice supply of water , then you  re good to go . no one directly lives on the sand , they just build high rises above , no more than five feet of the ground . the sand is just too hot to live on and the creatures can always surprise ya . the surface is even too hot for them . so they adapted to burying under the sand . these are different than their counter parts on the other side of the world . these are nothing but insects . the weaker ones reside near the equilibrium ridge . they get bigger as you go deeper into the sand pit . it  s hard to say how bug cause they usually stay underground a majority of the time . it  s hard to tell how they even survive out their due to them being sub terrain an  all but man would it be a sight to see . newline the equilibrium ridge is a nice combination of the two . a place where life finds a way . plant life is able to grow due to it being a natural river formed by the melting of snow from the tundra . the water softens up both sides of the land so then soil is able to be formed . that  s where life started beginning on this place . life for us mostly resides along this eternal river . watermills run along it , farming the energy from its strong flow . houses on the sand pit side are open . made with simple tree branches so that it has calm warm and earthy feel to it . letting in the warming touch of the sands . houses on the tundra side are small and sturdy little domes . made of rocks found to make it sturdy . they are made for much other than sleeping when we grow tired . they  re only big enough to fit a small family and a fire to keep it warm . the more luxurious houses are further from the edge where space isn  t as scarce . food consist of grains that we grow and whatever we catch from the tundra . hunting in the sand is useless as trying to stabbing the ground with a spear and hopping that you don  t hit a rock . newlinethree days . it s been here for three days and they still ca nt tell us what it is . newline newline ca nt or wo nt . newline newline sure , there have been press conferences . there have been scientists , priests , and soldiers studying it for days . but not one word on what it is . newline newline the news channels have simply dubbed it  the light  . their experts have thrown around words like  cosmic phenomenon  and  rare weather occurrence  . the church has called it  a sign  . newline newline i thought it was crowded in times square on new year s eve . this makes that look like the birthday party of a geeky kid in fifth grade . pilgrams . revelers . end of timers . how they got here , i ll never know . planes have been grounded for days and the city has been closed off for the last 48 hours . but everyone wants a glimpse of  the light  . newline newline i m no exception . newline newline it s just a ball of light from what i can tell . ca nt get too close , though . they ve got it blocked off for five blocks . newline newline the mass suicides started yesterday . there s even a webiste that s keeping a count . well a count of the ones that have been reported . the total is closing in on twelve hundred . it passed the one thousand milestone this morning . i guess it was just too much for them . the worst part was the children they took with them . i can only the excitement the felt when  the light  showed up . sure makes santa a lot more plausible . newline newline i m going to try to get a little closer . i d like to see if there s anything more to this , but this damn crowd is like trying to navigate through knee deep mud . and if i hear one more person dressed up as kirk say  beam me up , scottie .  , i m going to lose it . newline newline finally . i can see it . fuck . it s blinding this close . newline newline what are they doing on the other side ? why did they all just stop moving ? it s like the wave in reverse . silence is spreading around the crowd in an awed hush . newline newline what are they pointing at . shit . i knew i should have taken that apartment uptown . there s no way i ll make it over there . newline newline the fuck is that ? is that a person ? did they come out of  the light  ? what the hell is happening ? it looks like a person . the soldiers are approaching it with their weapons pointed at it . i m sure they know that whatever it is probably could care less . i mean , come on . they re pushing the crowd back and taking it with them in an armored vehicle . newline newline it s gone .  the light  is gone . no bang . no bright flash . it just went away . newline newline what just happened ? guess it s time to wait . newline newline           newline newline time travel . time travel is real . at least that s what they re telling us . apparently  the light  was the portal . the person that came through was from the year 2330 . they are not giving a lot of details other than  the traveler  , as hes been dubbed by the media , had a message about an incident that will occur in the future that we need to be aware of . that s it . that s all we know so far .using third person , despite , i think , the prompt implying a first person response . i hope that s ok newline newline rebecca struggles through the haze into consciousness . the noise is intense  the myriad microcosms of the jungle each adding their own atonal drone , shrill shriek or inhuman hiss to the miasma . newline newline the effect is freeing as our child s mind , thick with fever , gives her some small reconciliation for own it s unremitting reality . newline newline for a time , just enough , she is with the plaza with her parents . she s lying on the marble bench by the fountain . she can feel her mothers hand resting next to her face . she reaches out but finds nothing and the illusion escapes into the undergrowth . newline newline in the chaos of harsh , damp greens her hand rests gently on the edge of her rooted refuge . a soft , pink grain of humanity horribly ineffectual against the background of cloying , unthinking growth and effluvia . newline newline it can smell it . newline newline panicked , she pulls her hand back to her chest . she begins to weep silently  what a terrible mistake . newline newline whatever it is , she feels a connection to it . she knows when she has made herself known , when she has revealed something to it and , somehow , her awareness lends itself to it s knowledge . like a lucid nightmare , she has the sense that the horror that stalks her is irrevocably bound to her . in that way , she has control . but she s getting weaker  she is stricken . it s only a matter of time . newline newline there it is . she closes her eyes . newline newline far below her branch , a vast weight moves . it shifts unsteadily , unevenly . sometimes with impossible speed . at other times , it waits . newline newline she s never seen it . she has an awareness , on some level , that that would necessarily mean giving herself to it . though it is sometimes , in the deepest fevers , a temptation . but she feels it . newline newline she imagines a dense darkness  substance and emptiness flickering around one another in a vicious dance . sometimes it will have things recognisable as legs , hair and teeth but none of them necessary to it s being . she has no doubt she is responsible for these aspects of this presence . newline newline as it weights a horrific noise begins to ooze from its bulk . rebecca turns onto her back . something deep within her , something irreducible , wishes to see the sun . newline newline light and warmth laps her face as the bellowing roar envelopes her . she can see the canopy above her falling , the trees around her crunch and rattle as they are dragged to the ground . newline newline around her the jungle melts into the ground . the thick , moist barrier to the celestial warmth is removed and she is bathed in light . newline newline the sickening roar stops . newline newline for a moment their is absolute silence . newline newline she takes the time to smile . or perhaps she is given this time by whatever it is that has finally managed to isolate her form . newline newline her smile remains painted , her eyes fixed skyward , as she begins to fall .claire , a unitarian universalist minister , was in the middle of officiating a wedding when she suddenly finds herself on a deserted island  a beautiful prison . disoriented , she says to herself ,  where am i ?  a gentle voice whispers in her head ,  that does nt matter . look , there s not much time .  she looks around and no one is there .  who are you ? !   not important . humans are on trial . you murdered one of us and you re the only species that did .   one of you ? wait , only species ? !   you called him a messiah , a savior . you are being asked to justify his murder . you only have an hour to gather your thoughts , use it wisely .   what happens if i ca nt justify it ?  there s only silence .  hello ?  falling breathlessly to the sand , she is numb . newline newline one hour later , a council appears around her . they represent the intergalactic holy church  each member in a different form . she hears a booming voice in her head , explaining the crimes of her species and asking her to justify it . she squares her shoulders and replies ,  we are a single outlier in your test and i m ignorant of the other species . how can you ask me to explain that difference ?  a familiar voice speaks up ,  give her a week and access to the archives .  the council members agree . newline newline the council disappears and the contents of her office falls to the beach , with everything in its place . her computer is on and the archive is open . thankful for the familiarity , she gets to work . newline newline her time is up . the office vanishes and she is surrounded by the council .  state your case , human .  claire takes a deep breath and begins ,  for each test , you calculated when a species would be evolved enough to handle it . your calculation for earth was off by 4,000 years .  newline newline she continued ,  when you sent your tester we were nt even aware of the scope of our planet . even today , the majority of us still see our shared world as divided land . the weakest of us seek power through pain and can only hear a message of peace when they see someone suffer for it . jesus  murder created our first major shift and was a catalyst for others . most of earth s humanitarians were assassinated , selfsacrificed , imprisoned , or afflicted with poor health before their message made a significant impact .  newline newline after a long pause , the council leader asked ,  jesus , do you agree with this justification ?  he replied ,  as soon as i arrived , i knew they were nt ready . this trial gave them a chance to prove their progress and they have passed . we will recalculate the time and i will return when they ve matured .  the council agreed . without warning , claire was back at the wedding . when she had a moment alone she heard jesus  voice , that friendly voice from the very beginning , saying ,  your sacrifice will make a major shift . you have seven years to get your message out , use them wisely . i m proud of you , claire . it began as a cold , building to a multiple

slapped off the flakes on my hat , and leapt off the jeep . newline newline the wooden handle of the axe left chills on my fingertips , i did nt have gloves at the time . the wind blew violently atop of the trees , rustling the trees to and fro , almost as if we were partaking in a snowstorm . we pursuit deeper in to the woods , hoping to catch someone . newline newline jim s teeth chattering as he spoke ,  ccyrus , are you sure you did nt miss see ? we s been walking for a while now !  newline newline  shut the hell up ,  around some of the trees , tracks encircled them before leading off . cyrus took notice too ,  i gotcha  now you sons of a bitch .  cocking his pistol to his right and blasting a round into the midst of the snow . newline newline an silence followed through before a shadow emerged from behind a few trees back ,  i m safe ! do not shoot ,  a familiar voice called out . newline newline  greyson ?  my voice called out instinctively . newline newline a small frame , with blond hair and blue eyes became visible ,  kael , is that you ?  a smile formed as we stood face to face ,  it is ! kael , it s really you !  newline newline a click behind my ear intruded our reunion , newline newline  i thought your name was cline ?  newline newlinethe last man on earth looked up as he heard a knock on the door . newline newline  really ? you re fucking doing thi alright . alright , we re going to do this .  newline newline he flounced over to the door , arms swinging in scathingly sarcastic arcs . with the utmost dramaticism he swung open the door to reveal a clone of himself . newline newline  oh ho ho ! oh man , that s really original and cool ! it s himself and it represents himself ! are nt you just the next isaac asimov ?  newline newline the clone piped up ,  yeah , sorry , this is actually pretty lame .  newline newline i threw my hands up away from the keyboard and placed them on my temples . newline newline  well , shit guys , what else can i write ?  newline newline  browse around a bit , man . let s see ... dogs have taken over the world , how does their democracy function ?  is a little too ambitious . let s stray away from the worldbuilding . heh , get it ? stray ? because dogs ?  newline newline  i get it and i hate you .  newline newline  you wrote it . alright , flash fiction : in exactly one hundred words , tell me why my exwife was a bitch .  there s a little bit of baggage there , let s not .  newline newline i filter the results by newest so that there are less writers competing for upvotes and there is a better chance that i ll be top comment . i talk to my character because it seems i m okay with losing a grip on reality at this point . newline newline  ooh , how about this one ? the main character , tired of the multitude of metaprompts on this sub , attempts to convince hisher writer to not answer this prompt .  we re kinda already doing that , right ?  newline newline the last man on earth takes a seat on the toolbar of my computer and lights up a cigarette . newline newline  you do nt wan na do that , bud . we re already down the meta hole as it is . if we acknowledge that we re being meta about meta posts , oh man are we going to get in trouble .  newline newline the door to my room opened and in walked a clone of the last man on earth . newline newline  i m telling you , man , it s the last thing you wan

to get creative . hit me with your best shot !  newline newline  fuckin  jesus !  i jump to the corner of my room and barricade myself against my rapidly weirding universe with my blanket . i feel a tap on my shoulder . i turn to see a man holding a picture of a velociraptor on a bicycle . newline newline  hey man . image prompt .  he whispers . newline newline i leap over to my computer , pushing over clones of myself and of the last man on earth , all of them chanting in unison  never go meta . never go meta . never go meta .  newline newline i sprawl onto my keyboard and make a post , frantically typing to try and end this all . to try and convince others not to take the same path . i make a post , and title it the main character , tired of the multitude of metaprompts on this

for weeks . a drug that makes you dream you re living another life . i was skeptical to say the least , but jonathan was a close friend and had yet to lie to me .  how long is this trip gon na last ?  i asked . newline newline  i mean it can last from 12 to 24 hours . it wo nt seem that long , but trust me .  newline newline  so what if i stop tripping before you stop ?  newline newline  just let me finish my trip . you know where the food is if you re hungry . if you re thirsty you ll still have your water bottle when you wake up .  newline newline i sat down in the velvet chair , and jonathan sat in a duplicate across the room . through the window behind him the pale cascade of moonlight slipped in between the blinds onto the dusty floor . i took a quick sip of water and placed the pill on the back of my tongue . i swallowed as jonathan did the same . his eyes rolled back and his shoulders sank . i tried to stand up but had lost control over everything except for my eyes . one last look at my friend and then darkness . newline newline i awoke in a bed . to my right lay a child , she could nt be older than six or seven . to my left was a nightstand . on it was a picture of a man , the child , and who i assume is the mother . i got out of bed , careful to not wake the child and wandered through the home . down the hall was the kitchen , where a woman was busy making food . she called out to me .  good morning matthew .  newline newline  good morning sweetie .  i replied as i sat down in the dining room . she set a plate of eggs and hash browns down on the table and sat down next to me . newline newline  is emily still asleep ?  she asked . newline newline  yeah . she s laying in our bed right now .  newline newline  i ll go wake her . have some breakfast . you ve got a big day ahead of you .  she replied , smiling from ear to ear . newline newline i finished eating and looked at the calendar in the kitchen . it was a saturday . what kind of big day was ahead of me , i wondered . i walked back down the hall and received a hug from emily and a kiss from the woman . i reentered the room and opened the closet door . police uniforms among other clothes hung in front of me . i got dressed , and with a kiss goodbye to both my wife and daughter i left . newline newline the drive to the station was easy , as if i had traversed it every morning for the past 10 years . when i arrived a fellow cop approached me and asked if i was ready . we had been planning this bust for months and everyone was anxious for it to happen . the warrant had just been signed a few days prior and today was the day . after lunch and some more preparation , my partner thomas and i got into our car and headed out . we parked across from the house and sat in the car for about a half hour discussing the plan one last time . we got out of the car and approached the front door . we knocked and no answer . we knocked again and once more , no answer . thomas began to break the lock while i readied my handgun . the door swung open when thomas pushed and all was silent . no one was in the living room . i took the downstairs while thomas searched the ground floor . while checking a room in the basement i heard him yell for me . i ran up the stairs and saw him motioning toward another set . we searched and found a room full of various drugs . newline newline  now if only we can find this piece of shit was in the house .  thomas muttered under his breath . i checked the last closet and found a hatch in the ceiling .  hey thomas come check this out . you think this goes to an attic ?  newline newline  only one way to be sure .  newline newline while my eyes adjusted to the sudden change in brightness , thomas whispered to me  we got them now .  newline newline at the other side of the attic jonathan and i were slumped over in the velvet chairs . this trip was becoming too surreal for me i thought . with no second thoughts i shot three bullets at thomas  back in hopes that i would wake up from this trance . he fell to the ground but i was still in this other life . i put the barrel to my temple and fired . newline newline i woke up . a pool of blood was settling at my feet and two dead bodies lay on the opposite end of the room . i m sorry for your loss ,  mrs. lawrence greeted me that morning at the grocery store ,  teddy really was a good man .  newline newline  oh ... yes ,  i responded not entirely sure what she was talking about . newline newline she gave me a quick squeeze and went on her way . throughout this small town everyone knew everything about everyone . however , i have fooled them . i have kept a single secret my entire life : i can talk to the dead . however it seemed that my husband , teddy , was keeping secrets from me . where exactly had he gone ? newline newline i made my way home , carrying two heavy bags of food . around two weeks ago teddy was hospitalized with a coma and then one day , without warning , he was chilling in the living room . i asked him what had happened and he just said  let go and came home .  sorry for my loss ? maybe everyone thought he was still in a coma ? but everyone knows everything about everyone around here , so everyone should know teddy came home . weird ? i set the bags down at my doorstep and unlocked the door , letting myself in . newline newline  teddy , i m home ! we need to talk !  newline newline he floated over to me ,  yeah , i ve been wanting to ask you something for a while ...  newline newline i stared at him , squinting my eyes . was teddy floating ? oh my god . no . no fucking way . newline newline  teddy ! you re a ghost ! ? why did nt you tell me ! ? wait that means you died ! ? why did nt you tell me ! ?  newline newline  hey ! you can see and hear ghosts , gloria ! why did nt you tell me ! ? there s some freaky shit in this town and you just walk around like normal ! that s not normal ! and how come you did nt cry when i died ! ? i stayed behind to watch people cry at my funeral and you did nt even show up ! ?  newline newline  hey ! how was i supposed to cry for you when you were just sitting on the couch the whole time ! ? how was i supposed to know you were dead ! ?  newline newline  you were able to tell just now ! ?  newline newline  unless you float through walls or look like a demon , guess what , you might as well be a living person to me ! everyone looks the same !  newline newline  why did nt you ever tell me you could see ghosts ! ?  newline newline  why are we still yelling ! ?  newline newline i caught my breath and teddy only looked at me . he was so clearly hurt i never cried for him . i would have cried for him , i really would have . i would have stopped talking to people , shut myself away , and cried for hours everyday until someone forced me to act like a person again . i really would have . teddy , i would have wasted so much time mourning over you ... if you had let me know you were dead ! newline newline  when was the funeral ,  i asked . newline newline  yesterday ,  he replied . newline newline  you could have said something .  newline newline  i do nt want to be that married couple .  newline newline  who says we re still married ,  i teased . newline newline he immediately teared up and i shouted ,  it was a joke ! do nt cry ! i m supposed to cry here !  newline newline  no , i have an idea ,  he suddenly smiled . newline newline  i m only hearing you out because you re dead and this might as well be your last wish .  newline newline  let s stay married ,  he cheered . newline newline  huh ?  newline newline  you can see me and i can see you . we can talk to each other and just be like always . nothing will be different from before !  newline newline  yeah , except you re dead . people will think i m crazy living with an invisible husband .  newline newline  no , it could be fun . it was fun when i was alive ! and when things need to get freaky i can send chills down your spine way more easily like this .  newline newline  you re grossing me out , teddy .  newline newline  what do you say ? in sickness and in health ? even after death ?  newline newline i did nt know what to say so i just shrugged , not really believing what was happening . i ve seen ghosts before and have even helped a few of them pass on . but now what ? this is my husband we are talking about . do i really want to be haunted by him ? i never even got to mourn him ? he held out his ghostly hand and i reached for it ... only to have my hand go through his . newline newline  this is bullshit , teddy .  newline newline  women , ca nt live with them , ca nt live without them .  newline newline  whatever teddy , help me with these groceries .  newline newline  i ca nt do that .  newline newline  so nothing really will be different from before ... twenty years . twenty long years spent wasting away in this town . newline  no more  newline i said to myself while watching cars pass by the bus window . i was getting out of this town , one way or another . this town that cruelly judged me as deficient , disorderly , and dumb . i smiled as i saw the beautiful sign that told me i was finally out of this hell hole . newline something felt weird . newline something felt off . newline i slowly turned my head to the front of the bus as time seemed to stop . newline i watched in horror as the eight people in front of me disappeared and were quickly replaced by a heap of smouldering metal before i too was displaced . newline flashes of reality passed me by . twisted metal . loud noises . a car . the beeping of monitors . newline hushed voices . dropped clipboards . newline  doctor ... you wo nt believe this ... his blood ... .it s black .  newline another unfamiliar ceiling . newline i could not move my head but judging from the familiar too clean smell i was in a hospital . the same hospital i had spent months praying in as i watched my mother slowly decay into a shell of her former self and then finally die . newline i did nt want to be here . newline  n ... .u..r..s.e  newline i managed to rattle out in the best voice i could muster . newline it was not the beautiful nurse elizabeth to greet my weary eyes . newline it was a solider . newline his eyes were not stern , but filled with what i can only assume was terror . newline  doc , he s awake  newline the solider muttered quickly looking away . newline  sedative . now .  newline i recognized the voice of the all too composed doctor holliday . only this time , his composure was replaced with malice . newline that was the last thought i ever had in my small town .there were ten of them , dressed like charred corpses or else smoking demons from the darkest reaches of the galaxy . newline newline they wore ragged clothes of scorched leather and pitted armor plates , mudstained puttees wrapped round their legs . their helmets gave them the appearance of halfmelted human skulls , the dark gaping grins lending a maddening aspect to their visage . red rags were tied around their sleeves and legs , and hung from the slings of their demonic looking weapons , their color due to to being dipped in the blood of their foes . saw backed blades lay sheathed in scabbards at their waists and tucked into their boots , fearsome looking things that only enhanced their reputation for mindless violence . on several of their backs were tanks of superconcentrated fuel , the means for giving their flamethrowers terrible life . others carried rocket tubes or heavy demolition charges  weapons against any vehicle or emplacement they might come across . their leader was dressed much like the rest of them , only the amount of trophies and the deadly looking long lance fusion blaster labeled him as the senior pyrodrake of their number . he pushed up his helmet at the sight of their pilot descending down the small staircase into the hold . newline newline  should nt you be flying this thing ?  asked verien oshen of the molten anger monastery , his helm pushed up to reveal scarred flesh . newline newline tomess ghast smiled from beneath the pilot s helmet he wore , dark green with the alliance starbird in yellow . newline newline  i m letting lieutenant naytu try her hand at the controls .  newline newline the burned pyrodrake raised a brow , the actually hair long scorched away . newline newline  you re letting the lass fly the red wake ?  either you ve gone soft over the years or else you ve truly lost your mind . i though you said you d never let a single man touch her .  newline newline  emphasis on man ,  ver . she s a female , and a bothan to boot . but forget what a drunk man once said during a thirsty taungsday . you ready ?  newline newline the senior pyrodrake laughed , an antithesis of the stench of burnt meat about him . newline newline  does an arsonist like matches ? of course , say the word and it ll be on fire , have no fear .  newline newline the white haired pilot smiled at his fellow ord ivrishman . newline newline  good . you know the drill , burn th  newline newline  burn that which resist , spare those who do not . relax , ghast . this is nt my first barbecue you know .  he pointed at a blackened piece of an atat to make his point newline newline  fair enough , we ll be over the drop point in twenty minutes . your boys and girls know how the droppacks work ?  newline newline the pryodrake scoffed at the khern turned rebel and motioned over his nine warriors who laughed at unheard jokes or else talked quietly . newline newline  we ll be fine , ghast , have no fears . we may na  be deathfalcons , but i dare say we ll reach the ground in one piece , just do nt crash us with that cat o  yours at the helm , cause once we d be reborn in metal , i d thrash your tin ass until oblivion .  newline newline commander tomess ghast laughed at that and clenched the forearm of his friend and comrade . newline newline  die well .  newline newline verien oshen returned the handshake . newline newline  as should you .  honey , did you make the cheese platter ?  i shouted from the living room , as i furiously cleaned up the shattered remains of a lovely vase that we had received as a wedding gift .  just finished !  chirped wendy from the kitchen . we were about to throw a party celebrating our one year anniversary . god i love that woman . all of a sudden , a shock ran down my spine as a voice with notes of fire and brimstone whispered in my ear ,  wendy will die in childbirth ,  followed by giggling , not unlike that of a small child . i rolled my eyes and sighed . a column of fire erupted from the stove , and my wife let out a high pitched shriek , followed by a string of curses and colorful insults . when we bought the house six months ago , we didn  t expect to have housemates . especially not demon children . newline newline newline we found out about them the first night we slept in the house , when wendy and i were rudely awakened by visions of our parents dying . a voice that seemed to crackle and burn with the sins of a thousand souls exclaimed ,  hello mortals , welcome to our playhouse . me and my friend live here . our names are ,  followed by something that i can only describe as the very embodiment of suffering .  but you may call us abby and toby , as mere mortals can not say our names ,   the voice continued . wendy and i looked at each other , with pure shock on our faces . i managed to collect myself , and stammered ,  wwhat are you ?  the voices giggled excitedly , and i swear i heard a bit of a snicker as well .  we are demons of hell . i am abby , the daughter of abbadon , and toby is the son of caim . we live here , until we are old enough to become commanders of hell .   demons , huh , i thought to myself . isn  t it odd that they mentioned that they needed to be  old enough  ? how old are demons anyway , i pondered .  how old are you two ?  i asked , still terrified , but now curious .  we are both five human years old .   i was caught off guard i never thought that demons had children .  how old do you need to be to be commanders of hell ?   two hundred human years old .   i looked at wendy . her expression was as bewildered as mine . newline newline newline as the months went on , we got used to their antics we kept a collection of vases in the car , and bought several fire extinguishers for the numerous fires that broke out due to demon children not knowing how to control their powers . they were actually kind of cute every time they scared us , they would always laugh , just like regular kids . abby liked to tell stories through the flames she created in our living room . toby enjoyed practicing his musical talents by rhythmically breaking our vases . wendy made a spinoff version of candyland , simply called  hell  , and abby and toby would occasionally even join in . on july 4th , we had the best bonfire and fireworks show in the neighborhood . in all honesty , it was pretty fun most of the time . newline newline today though , i was not having it .  abby ! toby ! stop it right now !  i shouted , my voice booming through the whole house . suddenly , the house stood still . i let out a deep breath , and continued in a much quieter voice ,  we are having guests tonight , and it  s very important . just a few hours , please . then y  all can go back to your antics.  two voices replied in perfect , depressing harmony ,  fine . we will be quiet .    thank you ,  i exclaimed with a smile . i finished sweeping up the vase , and threw away broken shards . i went into my garage , grabbed another vase from the car , and placed it where the now broken one had stood . newline newline the door bell rang .  now remember , be quiet !  i said , as i went to open the door . newline newline   newline newline this is the first short story i ve written in a long time , and my first writingprompt submission ! please give me suggestionstips !i m a very gifted person . you see , most people in this world have one power but not me , i ve got two . to make this a little more dramatic

aaaaaachoooooo newline newline fuck . well , i guess that ruins the dramatic suspense . i m in the middle of the himilayas . that s right , i can teleport . but , before you lose your shit , there s one caveat : i do nt get to choose when i tp . it happens whenever i sneeze . it s like some kind of sick joke . actually , it is a sick joke . every superhero has their origin story . mine started out as ... newline newline aaaaaachooooooo newline newline shit . looks like i m in the amazon now . let s hope i do nt get mauled by a lion or something . so , origin story . mine is a humble one , no world blowing up , no dead family , nothing like that . actually , it was exactly a year ago . yay , happy anniversary to me ! i was visiting a friend in his lab . yada yada , we met , got lunch ,

about my other superpower . it s a great one , rivals the giants like superman , the hulk , all those guys . get ready to get your pants blown off . my second superpower is ... i sneeze every three minutes , accurate to the millisecond . and that s my life . i m a wanderer who literally ca nt be in the same place for more than three minutes . everything i m carrying gets left behind . the one perk ? i get to see the world over newline and newline over newline and newline over newline agai newline newline       newline newline had fun with this one . cheers !black . newline newline nothing but black . newline newline the noise was unbearable . even though i was sure that my ear drums had been blown apart seconds ago , the noise still stood there , screaming at me . newline newline the blackness writhed around , ever moving . i could make out ants of all shapes and sizes near the bottom , and a ring of what seemed to be massive bees made up a large section of blackness . those were probably the giant japanese hornets i had disposed of a few years back . i could make out rats , moths the size of windows , whole bee colonies swarming around , centipedes as long as i am tall , and many more unimaginable monstrosities , all blackened by the special pesticide i used . newline newline deer god , how am i gon na survive this ? newline newline a voice rang through my head . newline newline  contestant , please get ready !  newline newline  contestant , may the odds ever be in your favour !  newline newline  release the horde !  newline newline the black mass swarmed towards me . newline newline  they say the best stories start with a blinding white light  newline newline  morgan freeman ?  i thought , as a white light in the shape of a deer s head sliced through the black swarm , lasers beaming out through the lights eyes like a state of the art point defence system . great swaths of bugs fell to the floor as the majestic deer tore the horde apart . newline newline  morgan freeman , you ve came to rescue me !  newline newline  i m not morgan freeman anymore !  the deer shaped light said as it continued its path of destruction against my once horrifying foes  i am the deer god , father of roadkill ! you killed me  newline newline  no !  i screamed , interrupting the ghostly deer gods speech  do nt kill me , please !  newline newline   let me finish child , please  newline newline the last of the bugs fell . newline newline  and i forgive you  newline newline some strange force surged through my body , corrupting my mind and turning my frame to steel . newline newline  then only one more kill to go . vroom vroom motherfucker ! it had a strange blue glow to it . he noticed this as he held up his fingers to the light , watching as the halo of blue around it disappeared and reappeared as he pulled his hand away from the lamp . newline newline droplets of what seemed like infinite starlight , sparkling and shimmering , fell from his fingertips with each movement of his hand . the other one seemed to be dripping freely , almost like a faucet . newline newline  ... i m sorry , what did you say ?  he finally asked , turning back to the woman who was standing in front of him . newline newline she seemed annoyed , rolling her eyes as she repeated her question , lips spreading into a forced smile . newline newline  when did this all start , sir ?  newline  this ?  newline newline he gestured to his hand , wiggling his fingers and getting magical goop all over the woman s otherwise pristine office . he managed to hold back a smirk as her eye twitched . newline newline  yes , that s what i meant .  newline  oh . well , i ve always had my powers . you should know that , it should be in your little registry or whatever it is .  newline newline the woman , who ran the magical registry , could nt hold herself back from rolling her eyes that time . newline newline  sir . that s not what i meant .  newline newline he grinned at her and her eyebrows furrowed , lips drawing into a sneer . newline newline  i know , i know . just fucking with you , miss . uh ... my fingers started to ... er ... leak just last week .  newline newline her pen scrawled across the page , though she did nt move from her spot . the woman nodded and the pen laid flat against her desk . newline newline  okay , and why did nt you come to the registry the moment it happened ?  newline newline he shrugged . newline newline  i did nt think it was that big of a deal .  newline newline his nonchalance seemed to annoy her further . she opened her mouth to speak but he cut her off , waving his stilldripping fingers at her . newline newline  yknow , you seem to be pretty tense ... and i hear that i have magic fingers , i m sure i could help you out .  newline newline suddenly , her wand was out and she was pointing it at him with a fire in her eyes . newline newline  get the fuck out of my office !  she yelled , her voice reaching levels loud enough to stop whatever conversations were happening outside of her office . newline newline  but what a  newline  right now !  newline  maam , i th  newline  before i kill you or call security . get the fuck out !  newline newline he stood up and made for the door . newline newline  damn , you need to calm the fuck down .  newline newline and he barely managed to get out before a spell was hitting the door , locking it firmly . newline newline newline what is this ?  theodorin held his sword out , pointing it towards the small child who sat in front of a rectangular glowing box , that blasted sounds of screams . newline newline  it is a child ,  ragas explained . newline newline theodorin raised his brows and looked at ragas .  i know . i mean , why is it a child ? what is it doing ? where is the dark lord ? ? ?  newline newline his fellow heroes looked just as confused . cynthia aldor shook her head and abus shrugged . ragas just stood there , arms crossed and looking much like a typical pissedoff dwarf . newline newline  then i shall kill it , ending this reign of terror once and for al   newline newline  wait , theodorin !  cynthia aldor raised her staff , ready to cast a

slammed his axe down . it shook the ground below everyone s foot , but the child did nt seem to have noticed for he continued clicking away at his rectangular device . newline newline  the dark lord must have known we d be coming , so he put this child thing here ... the real concern is what it is doing . do you not hear those awful sounds coming from those boxes around him ?  newline newline cynthia aldor gasped .  oh no ! he s trapped ! perhaps some kind of spell ?  newline newline theodorin sighed .  we would have detected any magic by now . besides , he seems to be doing , whatever it is that it is doing , of its own free will .  newline newline  well , we must do something ... abus , shoot an arrow at its box ,  said ragas . newline newline  my pleasure ,  said abus . he tilted his bow slightly , aiming for the rectangle device before the child . releasing his hold from the bow , the arrow went spinning through the air , piercing the screen and killing its light . newline newline the small child jumped back , startled . he turned around him , but only saw his empty bed room . newline newline  huh . probably been playing too long . i m starting to imagine things ,  he muttered . newline newline with that , he stumbled to his bedroom lights , flicked the switch off , and went to bed . newline newline the end .page 52 of 140 newline newline newline offense  8 :

that feeds her and the darkness that her existence represents . she is calling to me , and i know that i will not be able to resist that call . she has taken my friends , my children and my lover . their graves are out there , empty . the shells of what they were still roam this earth , bending to her will . newline newline i look into her eyes and feel that power that bewitched the ones i love . i feel it creeping within the confines of my mind , reverberating against my darkest desires and compelling me to join her . her hand has been here for only a moment but it feels like an eternity . my mind is slowing down as my options are slowly being cut off . i desperately hope to resist and in that hope i turn to the very darkness that she is controlling within me . they are desires of what

as if reading my mind , and i stare back at her . she is used at being the predator . she does nt understand what she is witnessing . the darkness that warped around her morbid shape now envelops both

traveling . in the past , we experienced horrible atrocities because of the common man getting his hands on a time machine . newline newline the only people who are allowed to use time machines are those who are linked to the government . when people bitch about how nothing ever changes , that is the secret as to why . the people do not change , they just get new identities . newline newline as i said before , time traveling is very illegal , hence the black market offers a premium for anyone who can get their hands on time machines . it often costs more to use a time machine than the average person can make in five lifetimes . newline newline a while ago , some mobsters came up with the great idea that they will go back in time and play the lottery as a means to fuel their future operations . this worked out well and allowed mobsters and cartels to profit for many years . eventually , the government was able to trace the link between lottery winners and mob cash flow . the reason why so many lottery winners usually end up worse off than before is because once the government catches you , they will take everything you own . i m not talking about the 21st century america

looking for the source of the shot . in the building across from mine about 400m away i saw the unmistakable glint of a sniper scope . i waited for him to raise his head again . it must have been 5

and told them it was all clear and to head up to the roof of that building for med evac . i also jokingly told them to grab me the other sniper  s rifle not thinking they actually would . when i made my way back to base the next day i had a bloody ar38 sitting in my bunk . little did i know that rifle would be my curse and blessing . newline newline newline it was 3 days later and i was set up in

roisin o  shea sat at the bar , drinking a bottle of cold beer , she had had a long morning . roisin had been on her own overseas for the past ten years , for all she knew it could have been longer , she had been running for so long . roisin stared at the water stained wooden counter picking at the peanuts that the bar man had left for her . she was vacantly thinking about the life she used to live , the lovers she used to have , everything that she had to leave behind , all because of london . she lost the stomach for her job after london . newline newline the bar she was sitting in was definitely below her standards , but she often frequented dive bars to avoid attention , she knew that the men who would attend such bars would likely be locals and too intimidated to speak to her . she wanted to be alone so she made her way here , she  d been here many years before and although the staff had changed , the look and furniture had not . roisin took a quick glance around her and noted three men gathered around a rickety old wooden table , it looked like it was rocking back and forth as the men lifted and put down their drinks . they were older man , clearly locals , probably out of work , they looked past their prime . newline newline roisin  s attention was drawn away when the old tv hanging from the corner of the bar began to buzz with the excited speech of a news reporter . newline newline  can you turn that up please ?  something in roisin  s stomach told her that she needed to hear what was being said , and so , the barman , ever dutiful turned up the volume . newline newline  plosion was noted today at the seaside resort of le meridien mina seyahi . current reports from police and fire services indicate that only one floor was affected by the explosion , however , for safety both floors above and below have been evacuated and patrons moved to different rooms . the blast caused extensive damage to a number of rooms with room 724 being the centre of the blast zone.  newline newline the news anchor continued on in detail about the explosion but roisin couldn  t believe what she was hearing . that was her room , had they found her ? the colour drained from roisin  s face as the implications sunk in . if they had indeed found her she was no longer safe in dubai , this was the first time she  d returned to dubai in the past eight years , there is no way she was followed . she was still a member of the agency but operating under an alias that meier  s had created to keep her safe following london . roisin was an expert infiltrator and often informed on high level targets , she used her charms and beauty to get what she wanted . newline newline roisin was slight of build , had dark flowing curls and piercing blue eyes that appeared to look right through you . she was by all means , a beautiful woman , and she knew it too . newline newline roisin decided to take action , dubai was no longer safe and if she had been found out then she would be dead by the end of the day . she wouldn  t allow that to happen . roisin took a quick look at the clock ticking away slowly on the wall , 1:37pm . roisin picked up her beer with haste , took a large gulp , slammed it back on the worn , water stained counter and threw some money down for the barman . she rose from her seat and grabbed her hand bag in one movement and made her way out the door of the dark bar into the splitting sunshine . newline newline roisin wrapped a light scarf around her hair and neck as she made her way onto the main street , while not a local and certainly not a follower of islam she was of the belief that one should follow the customs of those around them , for politeness sake if nothing else . it also had the effect of blending her into the crowd , she knew her bouncy curls would stand out to anyone looking for her amidst the crowd of locals . a sense of urgency began to find its way into roisin  s psyche and she found herself walking a lot faster than she had intended . roisin  s field experience was telling her that she was in danger , she learned to trust her gut long ago . while slightly panicked at the phantom threat , roisin decided she had to return to the hotel to grab her belongings if anything remained . the most important thing for her was to get her passport , or one of them . she had many identities and many bank accounts , money didn  t matter to her , but without a passport she would have to resort to the embassy . newline newline roisin took a quick glance at her emporio armani wristwatch and noted the time , 2:11pm . she was conscious of the time , she knew a plane was leaving dubai for thailand this evening at 10:30pm , she would get on that plane and disappear again . the hotel was another 20 minutes away at least , although she would probably arrive sooner at the speed she was walking . her small heeled shoes creating a rhythmic clip clop as she walked along the boulevard . newline newline while she walked , roisin tried to run through various scenarios in her head . she tried to make sense of what was happening and the only thing which made sense was that someone who she betrayed had found out where she was . unfortunately for roisin , she had betrayed a lot of people and she knew it . newline newline roisin , once again lost in thought barely registered that she had arrived at the hotel , there were ambulances , fire services and police vehicles encompassing the building , as well as an army eod team , she recognised the bomb suits . the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles were giving roisin a headache , or maybe it was the exertion from how quickly she had walked , she couldn  t be sure . roisin checked her watch , 2:25pm . newline newline roisin made her way into the reception of the hotel , she was ushered in by the police after explaining her situation , she was a little overly flirtatious but her situation was desperate . her intention was not to draw attention if possible but time was beginning to run low . newline newline roisin stepped up the extravagant reception desk , richly decorated to suit the wonderful marble flooring and rich furniture place delicately around the reception . the workers behind the desk were busy evidently moving the residents of floors six and eight around the hotel . roisin gave the bell a quick rap and immediately was met by an exotic looking man , his face was not unpleasing to her . the man  s name badge read  giorgio napoli  . an unusual name roisin thought but then , it was an unusual day . newline newline  hello  , roisin pretended to read the man  s badge again .  mr . napoli , i  m so sorry to bother you but i just heard about the incident on the news.  newline newline  yes , quite a tragic thing really there was a single guest killed in the explosion.  a look of anguish was clearly visible on the man  s face . newline newline  oh , that is terrible indeed , the news report which i heard didn  t mention any fatalities  roisin feigned an upset expression , tears welling in her eyes . in truth , she didn  t care , she was more worried about herself . newline newline  a single woman yes , i am told she was quite beautiful by the other staff , i never met her myself . she was in the room when the explosion occurred , she was burned alive , or so the coroners told us . i ... i feel such pain for the poor woman , for this to happen in our hotel.  giorgio began to cry when he intoned his feelings to roisin . newline newline roisin froze in place for a moment . she didn  t want to believe what she had been told by giorgio . a woman died in her room , but it wasn  t her . who was it then ? what was this set up ? newline newline  so sorry madam , i never asked what service you require of me.  giorgio wiped his eyes gently with a napkin . newline newline  uhh , i knew the lady staying in room 724 . were any of her possessions recovered ? i know her parents would greatly appreciate some form of remembrance of their daughter.  roisin pretended to choke up midsentence and cried freely into her palms . newline newline after a moment she consoled herself and stood up straight , facing giorgio . newline newline  no miss , nothing was recovered , the fire destroyed everything.  there was no empathy in the man  s voice , instead , suspicion dripped off every word . newline newline  thank you for your time then.  newline newline roisin thought something was amiss and turned on her heel immediately , she had no time for messing around . roisins gut told her that she had been made , she didn  t know by who but she wasn  t about to wait around to find out . roisin hailed a taxi outside the hotel . newline newline climbing into the taxi with urgency , roisin couldn  t help but feel she was being watched , as she looked behind her she noted a police officer staring directly at her amidst the crowd of men busying about the fantastically luxurious hotel . the otherwise brilliant white structure was now marred by terrible flecks of smoke on the outside of the building that would be cleared up soon roisin knew . newline newline  where to miss ?  the taxi driver was a bit confused why this beautiful woman was staring out the back window , but attributed it to the commotion of the explosion . newline newline  american embassy , please , and make it quick  newline newline roisin  s tensions eased off a little bit as she sat in the back of the taxi , she looked at her watch , 2:45pm . newline newline roisin knew it would take more than a half hour to make it to the consulate in this traffic , she decided to sit back and think of her options . newline newline   part 2   https :

knowledge newline newline i hath been blessed with a long life , and all the luxuries and blessings one could want . in hoping to join my late husband in heaven , i wish to unburden my soul of the darkest sin . thus , on this very day , may the twentysixth , in the year of our lord 1655 , i have my final confession to bear : newline newline though proof was scarce , i knew it in my very heart and soul that william shakespeare did away with my dearest friend christopher marlowe . we were not lovers , as i do not believe his eyes were ever on the fairer sex , but dearest of friends nonetheless . he was a brother , a confident , and i felt our bond deep within my very soul . the day he was slain was the day my life took a turn down a dark path from which it never truly emerged . i found true love in my marriage to the frenchman i met in dorset , i bore nine healthy children all of whom have survived to bear me twentythree grandchildren , and i am a wealthy woman . yet the sword that pierced marlowe in turn pierced my heart , and the hole has never closed . it has been a dark cloud over a blessed life . newline newline after murdering the light of my life , shakespeare stole his life s work and added it to his own . i had the burden of having to spend time with the monster , and feign ignorance as to his true nature . i heard him chatter like a young maiden about macbeth . from the moment he wrote it , he adored it . whether or not it was even from his own plume was a question that has always lingered . how many bodies did shakespeare leave behind him ? i should nt say such a thing without evidence , but my rage flowed through me . newline newline there should always be a trail of death with shakespeare s work . then , all can know his nature as i have . i obtained a pair of chicken feet , a bloodied knife  both from a local butcher  , and a small piece of wood . i sha nt repeat the curse i used , but t was an ancient latin rhyme . the night o the premier , august 7 , 1606 , t was i standing behind the theatre , dressed in black , conducting a play of my very own . newline newline the first fatality was that night . i felt some sorrow at having taken the young gentleman playing lady macbeth , but i knew the spectre of death would now haunt shakespeare . newline newline the curse should lose potency with time . i do think i may be damned no matter how i confess now , but at least my immortal soul is unburdened . newline newlinederrick was a big man . two meters tall and two hundred pounds the former hammer throw champion went about his

jumped onto the side of his garbage truck as his  accomplice  hit the gas propelling the cumbersome truck 20 feet to the next house . newline newline  i hate this job ,  derrick muttered to himself .you realize that you must be a computer simulation run by christians with access to advanced and powerful computing technology in the future . you relax a bit , your worries about mankind s troubles with the 21st century bottleneck seem to be unfounded at least with respect to the reality of the creators . newline newline hopeful about the prospects for humanity s future but sad you will almost certainly never see such a thing yourself , you find a bible and convert to christianity because knowing christians they probably thought simulating hell would be a pretty fun thing to do too . you figure you may as well worship their god simulation and get a look at what future christians think heaven is supposed to be like . newline newline in a fit of snarky whimsy surely brought on by the absurdity of your circumstances , you relocate your cheap livingroom couch onto the front patio and make yourself some popcorn and a refreshment . you stare out into the growing chaos engulfing town as the sun sets , and reflect on all the existential questions that come with the sudden realization that you are a computer simulation . newline newline  this is just ridiculous ,  you think , watching one simulation assault another and run off with a simulated stolen cart of simulated looted groceries .  i mean , someone probably spent considerable time coding all this . why are future humans still wasting all this time obsessing over nursery rhymes and fairy tales from the iron age ?  your popcorn starts to taste rather cynical , and your drink s snarky tang has left too . you sigh , and head back inside to catch some sleep , your former optimism concerning humanity s bright spacesailing transhumanist future crushed . newline newline as you lay in bed , the din of riots and fires in the distance , you begin to drift into sleep . your last thoughts before darkness takes you snark quietly in your mind ,  well , i guess angels and demons and battles between the forces of light and darkness are cool in their own way , too .  newline i told you .  said the elderly gentleman to his dying wife . newline newline she could barely speak anymore . the oxygen running to her nostrils was her only source of breath left . newline newline  told me what ... ?  she managed to utter . so much of her was gone . her love of her husband was one of the few things she had left . newline newline  i told you not to make the deal .  he said .  i m not heartless , you know . i warned you . i tried to get you to change your mind . but you signed yourself away anyway .  newline

newline newline  i m not michael and i never have been . i do nt love you , nor have i ever .  he said . newline newline  michael ,  she repeated . she was still confused , but his tone sounded familiar , like a voice she knew long ago . newline newline  i m not michael . i never have been . i do nt love you .  he said again . newline newline she recognized the voice now . decades worth of regret washed over her . she could feel herself getting cold . her eyes started to well up but there was nt enough life left in her to cry . she pictured herself at seventeen . she vividly remembered the pain and loneliness of that time . it snapped right back into her as if it had never left . her misery was returned to her tenfold . newline newline she could feel her heartbeat weakening , her breath shortening . this moment was worse than anything she could have ever imagined , and she wished death would nt take its time killing her . newline newline  we re not done .  the man said , as he took an unmarked vial out from his inner jacket pocket . he grabbed a syringe , filled it with the liquid , and mixed it into her iv drip . newline newline with a large gasp she shot up in her bed . her heart started pounding . she felt more lucid and awake than she had in years . newline newline  no ...  she said with bewilderment in her now wide open eyes . newline newline  oh , yes .  the man said with an uncomfortable looking grin . he grabbed her wrist and twisted it back towards him sharply . she let out a yelp . he took out a tool she d never seen before and pressed it against her arm . she cried out as it seared her flesh and imprinted a strange branding on her . newline newline  why are you doing this to me ! ?  she asked . newline newline he looked at her and held her gaze , the smile gone from his face .  because you asked me to ,  he said with seriousness in his voice . newline newline  come on , let s go .  he said as he quickly changed out from his clothes and into scrubs . he put another liquid into her iv , different from the one before , and she found herself paralyzed , unable to move or talk . she watched the ground helplessly as he wheeled her out of her room . she watched him press the buttons on the elevator , she watched the numbers on the door change . members of the staff walked by and she found herself pitifully unable to call out to them for help . she felt the bumps and jostles as he loaded her into an ambulance , the rumble as the engine started . she had the awful feeling that she would nt die  not for a long time . she dreaded that this was the start of a new life for her , one much longer and more painful than the one she had just finished living .she clutched a tattered box to her chest . approaching through the fog , she hugged the box closer and closer still , even though her grimy hands and pale knuckles looked too weak to hold anything so tightly . a ragged dress hung from the slight frame and her long dark hair dripped wet fog crystals . all was silent in the heavy , damp air . she didn  t even look up as she reached him and collapsed with a sigh , crumbling like a paper bird into his arms . newline newline gingerly , he brushed back the thin strands covering her face . not quite believing still , he searched her narrow frame for the one thing that would identify her truly as his lost beloved . could it really be her after all this time , or just another cruel trick from the ancient loveless ones who ruled this place ? he hunted beneath the dirt of endless miles , which surely she could not have crossed . she was almost a ghost in his arms . newline newline her mark was not there . desperate now he rubbed harder at her forearm , as if the tattoo would appear on her skin just by wishing it there . she shifted and cried in pain , and he made to throw her from him , but with a last effort she thrust the box into his own thin chest . the wet and peeling cardboard disintegrated on impact , and a tiny blackbird flew out to meet him . newline newline  i gave you my heart ,  she whispered . looking down he saw her clear blue eyes open one last time .  that is how i found you . now i give you my life , such that remains.  she smiled , and then even that faded , and she was gone . newline newline the blackbird took her place in his hands , and it seemed more alive than anything he had ever held . then it preened its feathers , lifted its beautiful head , and sang until the fog rolled back and the days returned and his heart was full once again . the endless prison was fading away , and soon he would be free . the blackbird sang and sang until she , too , was gone . newline newline her life for his . he would never forget . newline newline  newline this is my first post . comments and cc appreciated .as one might be prone to do in dire times like these , i m sure all of us wanted to scream and run like terrified children . but to the chagrin of our instincts , we had to remain in complete silence , for the sake of safety . newline newline it had started as a carefree camping trip , just me , andy , and jeff going out to experience the great outdoors . we had spent the late afternoon hiking , and after a dutchoven cooked meal in a nice little clearing that seemed good to us , we crawled into our tent and descended alongside the sun into our own slumber . newline newline but in an unbelievable stroke of luck , jeff had been restless and gotten up to take a little walk around 4 in the morning . and that s when he d heard something prowling through the underbrush . newline newline mountain lion . newline newline we hit an even bigger jackpot of luck when jeff decided not to make any noise and to just slink back to the campsite to shake us awake . he could nt have known at the time , but we were not prey . we were intruders in this big cat s territory , and it only wanted us out . newline newline we tore down the tent as quickly and silently as we could , but not quick enough . as we started trying to make our way out of the clearing , we all heard a quiet growl from no more than a few meters away . frightened looks all around , of course , but we somehow all knew that making a ruckus would not be the best course of action , so we maintained our silence . newline newline creeping along as stealthily as we could , a slow exodus was made from our makeshift campsite and back to andy s jeep parked about a quarter mile away . the distance would nt have been more than a few minutes hike for us during the day , but the darkness and the necessary silence made the journey take several hours . newline newline there were a few close calls where a noise or shadow in the distance made us all consider finding a god and getting on our knees , but we made it safely back to the jeep in the end . speaking to the park ranger the next morning , we found out we were definitely lucky to have gotten out unharmed , but that the lion had never intended to kills us . newline newline close calls , man .leraje , captain of thirty legions of demon warriors and master tactician of ranged combat , missed the germanic tribes . newline newline they had really known how to put on a show  running into battle brightly painted and hopped up on amphetamines , uttering battle cries that could make his own legion shudder , smashing into the ranks of their enemies with no apparent care for their own well being . even the archers , who leraje was responsible for backing , kept long daggers to hack at their opponents with given the chance . newline newline when the new ground war was announced , leraje had been excited to return . another chance to march his legions over the earth and clash with heavens soldier and maybe even get some of those crazy painted warriors on their side , but those days were gone . newline newline those ravenous warriors he d remembered had lost out in the long run . human soldier had lost their style points and followed the boring roman way of battle  order , training , superior equipment , not a single amphetamineaddled screamer . newline newline the angels , those naive blonde fucks in their stupid white flowing robes , were down for fight . apparently heavens intelligence had dried up around 10 ce and the angels had flown back down to make their reappearance with flaming swords and shining armor , all of which just made them easier targets for a terrified humanity . having no backing from god who had washed his hands of humanity after the whole cross incident , the heavenly host of platinum blonde legions had nt even reached hells front lines before they were wiped out . newline newline the gnashing , howling host of demons waiting to ripe the angels from the sky had taken a confused pause when they did nt show up . although they were not given much time to be confused . satan ordered their first incursion in the holy lands to spite god . unfortunately , the  gaza strip  or whatever humanity called it today , was nt a friendly place . samyaza and vapula had the honors of leading the infantry , something leraje had envied until they were shredded by all the local  peace keeping forces .  newline newline that had really set the ton for the war as a whole . the crowded and vicious hordes of squishy pink humans washed over their supernatural foes , overjoyed at the prospect of new lands to conquer . heaven was being rebuilt by the un and hell looked like it was up next with the remaining princes of hell barely holding the gate against the lazy artillery barrages the humans were throwing their way . newline newline leraje still did miss the screaming germanic warriors , but this calmer approach to war did have it s benefits . when the tide of war was made clear and leraje had begged to switch sides his request had been granted . apparently the north americans had once had good luck poaching people from a regime worst than hell s for their space program , so they had been fairly open to the idea . newline newline instead of archers , he was now in charge of the artillery now fixed on hell s gates . though he felt a shadow of guilt at turning on his comrades , the demon captain could nt help feeling excited at the chance to exact revenge on those  princes  who had looks down him for so long , and this way he did not have to face the now immortal soldiers of the un who cycled down from colonized heaven every time they were shot . though perhaps he could get a place in that cycle if he showed true reformation . fucking humans , they have all the luck .the best

right there , that i d have him . that i d whisper in his ear how much i wanted him inside me , all the beautiful , bloody things i wanted to do to him . newline newline he was going to be my gorgeous , glorious dinner , i knew . i gestured to one of my friends they re always quick and eager to be helpful and had them take off one of my prey s ears with a knife . he screamed , just like i knew he

philosophy in mind .everybody loves kazaam . or at least , now they do . newline newline when kazaam first appeared on the streets , he was known only as chris smalls , and he did nt have a very pristine reputation . the guy could teleport anywhere he wanted to at will , so of course he was teleporting into places where he did nt exactly belong . vip clubs , secure areas , ladies locker rooms you name it , and chris at some point or another got into it . eventually , the law caught up with him , and an arrest at all costs was put out through the system . wanted  dead or alive  joked all the newspapers . it seemed like young chris was heading nowhere , or rather , everywhere , in a hurry . newline newline but one day , the cops came forward with a deal . they had a hostage situation , and they could use his help  get the innocent people out of there , and his crimes would be forgiven . chris jumped on the offer , and sure enough was able to teleport into the bank and save those people . with chris  helping hand , they were even able to catch the crook himself , who happened to be none other than a nefarious serial robber with a hefty bounty . chris suddenly had a clean record , and a pocketful of cash . it was then that he realized that he could probably really help the people around him , while earning a comfortable living on the side . newline newline it took some time for the public to change their opinion of him , but soon he became everyone s favorite local hero . his face became a common sight on the evening news , and his new name , kazaam  , a frequent subject in the paper . and this time , it was for all of the good reasons . ironically enough , he was now getting into all the sorts of places he wanted to before , except with open doors and arms . kazaam had a good life going for him , and it seemed like there was nothing that could stop his zero to hero story . newline newline you can imagine hank s surprise when he looked up late one wednesday night to see a disheveled and slightly drunk kazaam stumble into his bar . newline newline kazaam shuffled over to the bar counter , eased himself onto one of the stools and laid his forehead against the cool wood . hank could nt hear exactly what he started mumbling about , but he heard scotch  and rocks  somewhere in there so he poured out a glass and placed it next to kazaam s head . newline newline  on the house . you earned it , kazaam .  newline newline kazaam raised his head , stared at the glass for a moment and then downed it . he smacked his lips , rubbed the back of his sleeve against his lips and then buried his face in his hands . newline newline  thanks ,  muttered kazaam .  but tonight , i am chris . and i m paying for that drink .  newline newline hank shrugged and took chris  glass .  sure thing , chris . whatever you want . anything else i can get you ? anything i can help with ? you seem a little ... down .  newline newline chris lowered his hands and propped his elbows on the counter . he gave hank a bewildered look , as if he did nt really understand what he just said .  you mean ... you actually care ? i mean , you care if i m , you know , feeling down ?  newline newline  well , yeah , sure . i may not be able to help much , but i got a pretty good ear . hell , you are probably a lot more interesting than the normal bozos i get around here .  hank chuckled to himself a little .  cmon , chris . i ll hear anything you have to say . i can only imagine what can get one of you super heroes down .  newline newline chris  face turned sour with the words super hero  .  i hate being a super hero ,  he whispered .  people do nt understand the cost of a super power . they do nt understand what we have to give up . give me another scotch and i ll tell you why .  newline newline hank pulled out the scotch and poured out a generous amount for chris . chris picked his new glass , swirled it in his hands for a moment , seeming to be mulling over what he was going to say next , before taking a sip . he placed down the glass and began to speak . newline newline  when i teleport , it it not instantaneous to me  i still have to travel there .  chris raised his glass as if for another sip , but instead began to stare into the depths of his drink .  when i teleport , i fade into what i can only describe as nonexistence . for all intents and purposes , i die . and let me tell you , is it painful .  chris finally took another sip and put the glass down . newline newline  when i teleport , i go into the beyond . it is cold , and painful , and scary . i would nt wish my worst enemy there . at first , i would only teleport into places that i could nt normally , but would be a lot of fun . i mean , it would have to be pretty damn awesome place to justify that sort of pain , right ? but when i got into trouble , things were nt so fun anymore . my trips were no longer done for pleasure at that point , but were done as a distraction . i could nt just stop teleporting , because it will never leave me . the memory of the place is burned in my mind . it followed me in my sleep . it haunted me .  newline newline chris fell silent again and took a drought from his drink . he started chewing his lip , trying to think of what to say next . hank was bewildered . he had no idea how chris was able to teleport , and he had never really thought of it . he felt sorry for the kid , now , whereas before he might have been a little jealous of the boy . newline newline  that sounds terrible . but you then started helping people . you saved lives . did that help ?  newline newline chris smiled wryly .  at first it did . the police deal was a dream come true . and then i certainly got some satisfaction from helping people . but soon , the novelty wore off and i could no longer escape my pain , again . for every life that i saved , i died . it was excruciating . and now , i am trapped . helping people is the only reason i live , but for everyone i help i must die . i ca nt just abandon it anymore , too . it is too much of who i am . the cold and the pain follow me , regardless . even when i am alive , it is almost like i am dead .  newline newline hank was speechless . he did not except anything like this . reeling , hank said the only thing that he could think .  what s it like , dying ?  newline newline chris smiled , looked hank in the eyes , and responded ,  why do you think i have nt gone for real , yet ? my master plan is brilliant . these ignorant , stupid superheroes will be too busy to stop me . i will have the be having a good time  having a ball  with my friends kim , putin , and trump . muhahahah . do nt stop me now . do nt stop me now . you do nt even know where my base is . i have direct lines to the leaders of the usa , russia , and north korea . i already have made agreements with them to use their militaries . i m working with china now . china is north korea s mummy nation . un is already doing my bidding . i ve set all that up while you stupid superheroes were busy recapturing stupid petty criminals . fuck your all . ca nt stop me . ca nt stop me . now i m going to have these leaders blow up the word just for fun . i m on a rocket with elon musk and richard branson to our hidden space station on the dark side of the moon . the world leaders think they will join us . they are on a rocket as well , but it wo nt launch on time . oops i did it again . muhahahaha .the ballad of the great promptful dragon newline newline  nbsp  newline newline listen my

newline newline then , along came the great promptful dragon , newline newline with great style , and great wit , and great taste , newline newline but most of all , a great wisdom and love , newline

from his dreams . he sighed , looking at the cell around him . his dreams were far more pleasant than this place . standing took a lot of effort , as did everything else in this place . once he was up , his cell door opened and a couple of guards came in .  time for your checkup santos.  newline newline he held out his hands for the cuffs .  let s get it over with then.  newline newline the guards were quiet on the short walk to the infirmary , which was perfectly fine with ryan . in the infirmary a doctor directed the guards to an exam table . they shackled him to it and then went to wait outside .  ah , mr santos , how are you doing today ?  the doctor asked as he walked over to ryan . newline newline he grunted .  all due respect sir , can we just get this over with ?  newline newline the doctor frowned .  very well .  newline newline newline  newline newline newline ryan grunted and pushed himself off the ground , opening his eyes . he shook his head slightly , feeling groggy . looking around him , he found he was in a large room , blackened with marks from what must have been from an inferno .  the hell is this ?  newline newline he rubbed his eyes , his sight still blurry from waking up , and it was nt getting any better . his head was pounding in his ears and his skin felt like it was on fire . letting out a groan he stumbled through the room looking for the door . after a few laps to make sure it was nt just his eyes , he realized there was no way out . newline newline there was a camera in each corner of the room that ryan had nt noticed before . he stood in front of one of them and waved his arms .  hey ! let me out !  newline newline the room was twenty paces by twenty paces . he learned this by pacing from camera to camera , hoping to get someone s attention . as the hours passed he got more and more agitated .  let me the hell out of here ! this is cruel and inhumane , ai nt there laws about that !  newline newline his skin burned and itched while his head pounded louder and louder . he scratched at his arms so much that he tore his skin .  please , something ai nt right with me . i need a doc !  newline newline help was nt coming . he had figured that out hours ago . it did nt stop him from trying . he had to get out , escape . anything to be out of this room . newline newline a flash of heat ran through his body , dropping him to his knees . his skin began to glow , waves of light flashing under his skin . he tried to scream but all that came out was light . the heat crescendoed until his body could contain it no longer . newline newline in that moment he outshined even the sun .the first time i was born , i had nothing . my childhood memories were tinted in gray , and it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth to this day , perhaps residual contaminants from the decaying society i was birthed into . newline newline i can remember when i left . if i was a little younger , the warmth of mississippi might have removed the chill from my skinny body , and the memory and tongue of my dead mother from my mouth . newline newline maybe i was just old enough to hate the fact that the only reason i enjoyed the relative opulence of life in lowermiddleclass america was because my new parents wanted benefits for adopting a child . my paperwork was easy , and i had white skin . i hated that thought , just like i hated my classmates for mocking my accent . newline newline i dragged my way up . first in sports , i desperately competed , each year packing pounds onto my bony frame . i mowed lawns for money , and , when i got older , sold drugs . every job i had was an opportunity to skim money from registers , pocket whatever i could , and claw myself a little farther forward , to become something that i could nt quite articulate , but knew that i needed to become . newline newline years go by , and i finally lost the gamble of my life on a street corner , clutching a sovietmade handgun , watching my partner , an undercover cop , bleed to death in the back of a uhaul packed to the brim with cocaine . newline newline but luckily we live in a civilized society . why do now what our ancestors could do in a parallel universe ? it s a sick society that lacks the integrity to commit murder . newline newline the second time i was born , i had nothing . the soldier found me , huddled in a ball , clothing torn and covered in mud , on the side of a riverbank . i woke up , a deep throbbing in my head , and stood , cold mud oozing between my toes . i straightened , and took a deep breath , the fishy rot and coal smoke filling my lungs . newline newline the soldier was a perfect mirror of what i would have been had i not been adopted . skinny and motherofpearl pale , wearing a loosefitting brown uniform , clutching his rifle with spidery hands , staring at me with very round blue eyes , speaking the language i grew up with . i stood a head taller than him , my skin tan and bulging from muscle . newline newline i pushed his face deep into the mud until he stopped breathing . newline newline in the years since , i have killed many men , but he stood out to me , and i owe him , because he was the first step in my long journey upwards . some people must push inexorably to the top , or else flame out spectacularly , and it is a condition of their existence , just as unstoppable as breathing . i have charged through cobbled streets in rags , men falling around me form snipers bullets . i have marched through bitter cold to bayonet men in their sleep , and executed my own compatriots without blinking . i basked in every award , every honor , every day that my name was nt on the executioners list , and every day that i woke up without having to take a bullet to the brain on account of venomous whispering , every day i woke up starving but alive , or screaming in pain from a sucking chest wound , bandaged by illiterate peasants without a drop of morphine , every single day i was alive and able to rise inevitably upwards . newline newline today i hold the power of life and death in my hand . the same model handgun that ended my chances in the last life has just ended the life of chairman khrushchev , and my fellow kgb officers are destroying his cabinet with bursts of gunfire . i can ignore this , as i draft a memo on stationary embossed with the symbols of high office in the party . i smile as i write . newline newline  from the acting chairman of the communist party of the union of soviet socialist republics : newline newline this is a general order to all forces of the red army : conduct an immediate mobilization , and prepare for battle with the enemy  newline newline absolute victory was my only option in this life .i tilt my head slightly to the right , trying to get a better look at the man in front of me . his hat blocks the street light from his face , leaving it covered in shadows . he takes the brief case in his arms and opens it facing me . inside i see stacks and rows of bills . on top of them is a handgun . newline newline  take it ,  the man says . newline newline i look back to him , confusion etching onto my face . newline newline  you know what to do .  his voice sparks a fire in my mind and it feels as though a lock has clicked open . unafraid and with a confident hand , i take the gun from the case . newline newline cold heavy metal presses into the skin of my hand as i adjust my grip . the man in front of me closes the case full of money and hands it to me . with a nod , he turns and starts to walk away . newline newline quickly , i raise the gun and pull the trigger , nailing the stranger in the back of the head . he falls forward landing with a thud onto the concrete . newline newline no one tells me what to do . reginald was almost free , he could feel it . just a few more feet of digging , and he d be out . his intuition , his sixth sense , told him he d be about 100 feet from the outer prison wall . more than enough . with his short stature and under the cover of night , there was no way the guards would see him . newline newline he did nt deserve to be in prison anyway . blackmail was such a minor crime , and the secrets he knew ... the people to whom those secrets belonged , they were the real criminals . so what if they paid him to keep quiet ? he had a gift . the prosecutors had called it a scam , called him a conartist . but reginald knew his powers were real . he could predict the future , know things he should nt , see outside of what normal people saw . newline newline and people had trusted him . probably because of his size . a genetic defect , the doctors had said . he d never grown taller or larger than an average 5yearold . it made people sympathetic , likely to open up their minds , open up their secrets , even if they did nt know it . and once he knew their secrets ... people would pay almost anything to keep their secrets hidden . newline newline finally , he felt the last bit of earth crumble before his fingers , as he widened the hole and scrambled out into the moonless night air . he was out . he was free . newline newline he was a small medium at large .the first indication anyone in class had that something was wrong was the professor freezing mid sentence . one moment , he s standing in front of the class lecturing monotonously on golden ratio and the next his chalk was clamoring to ground . following the line of his wideeyed stupor the children looked around , toward me , sitting in the back of the class watching a charcoal black hand slowly climb its way out of the my spiral notebook . newline newline my face must have matched the teachers , and it certainly wouldnt be long before everyone else s faces changed to match as well , like echoes of professor albert and i s surprise . newline newline next came a voice . i suppose we should call it a voice . it was more like the sound of a car accident squeezed and malformed into something resembling english words , though i could nt quite make it out . a few children screamed and the obvious scent of evacuated bowels filled the room . i was nt sure if it was a terrified classmate , or perhaps it was coming from the circle . hell , it could have even come from me . newline newline inch by inch it slithered and crept up and out of my notebook . part of what must have been it s slimy charred black head , and one full arm had made it through . one of the more courageous students attempted to smash it back down into the nothingness that it crawled out of with the heft of his mathematics textbook but it struck an invisible barrier and turned to ash . the circle i had doodled in my book expanded and the creature was able to come through faster . newline the crunch of it s unsettling metal voice beginning to become understandable phrases . newline newline  which of you tiny powerless imbeciles assumed the right to disturb me ?  newline newline all four of it s glowing amber eye s locked on my . the cute girl two seats away fainted . i had had a crush on her , now i wasnt so sure she would nt be crushed herself . newline newline i stammered and stuttered uselessly as the creature grew in size and completely entered the room . it was well over nine feet tall , with six spindelly spidery legs that clacked against the tile flooring . hunched over , it came in close , the stench of it s body choking me as it roared , it s anger shaking the building , shattering one of the windows as i fell out of my chair and scuttled backwards until my back was pressed against the wall . the creature was between me and the way out . i was trapped . newline newline  answer me little monster  newline newline every hair on my body stood on end as i vomited on the beast , apparently a biological attempt at purging a stomach filled with nothing but fear . newline the beast let it s purplegrey tongue slither out of what i could only describe as a jagged torso and lapped up the bile ... my overpowering disgust at the sight gave me brief reprieve from the overwhelming fear . newline newline  me  i squeaked pathetically , feeling like anything spoken allowed was a simultaneous triumph of bravery and a temptation for the creature to tear me apart . newline newline  well then  a voice in my head , much more pleasant but still clearly born of this monstrosity spoke ,  what is it that you desire most deeply  newline newline i curled into a ball and began to weep uncontrollably . maybe i had gone insane . newline i did nt have words . i couldnt even think . it reached out with it s charcoal arm and touched a sharpened clawfinger to the center of my forhead . it burned like a hot poker and i screamed the deepest rawest scream i have ever screamed before or since . when it moved its claw , it said , almost thoughtfully , newline newline  i see ...  newline newline then it vanished ... leaving a classroom of damaged desks pushed into a massive circle around me , empty stares , the stink of shit , and disheveled attempts at regaining composure . newline newline  what the fuck was that ?  i muttered to the tension in the room . newline newline as everyone gathered themselves they turned their gazes back to me . instinctively , i knew that what would come next was nt going to be pleasant for me . i was nt ready for blame , much like i was nt ready for what actually happened next ...everyone was dead . and yet , they gasped as they took the first breath of life . newline peace was universal , as was war . newline newline the earth was scarred and barren , but was more fertile and full of life than ever before . newline newline i walked among lives that struggled for every heartbeat . i observed those that never wanted for anything . it was all the same to me , and it was always unique . newline newline events raged all around , happening on top of each other . a mushroom cloud rose over hiroshima as an aztec priest held a still beating heart above his head . a chimpanzee watched as a chainsaw spewed the life blood of the amazon , while men froze to death searching for the north pole . a meteor wiped life off of the planet as man triumphed over science and religion . newline newline time was flowing around me . i reached out my hand and felt the waves throb beneath my fingers . newline newline spanish galleons sank with untold treasure , lightning struck a lone tree in the sahara , innocents screamed as they were slaughtered by a madman who painted watercolors . newline newline i slowed the tide of time . newline newline a man sat at a table . he was clothed in a simple tunic , and scratched at his beard thoughtfully . a light shone in his eyes . an idea sparked within the recesses of his mind and as it grew , so did the smile on his crafty face . his name was archimedes , but his deeds rippled through out history . newline newline the waves gently pushed me back , and i let them . the ebb and flow returned as my eyes closed , and when i opened them again i was in the twenty third century . newline newline the world held one unifying currency , and government and religion were one . freedom was a dream , nothing more . and dreams had no place here . newline newline i moved on . newline newline once i had tried to change the course of this world . to see if a simple action could mold the future , like diverting the course of a river . i failed . newline newline i had not accounted for this euphoric feeling that consumed every fiber of my being . the rush of living and the pain of dying . the memories , sensations and ideas , of humans and animals . i could not leave the stream for more than a few seconds . but i did nt want to . newline newline it was all around me . within me . newline newline i was time .the secret room underneath was miraculous . there were blades aplenty , proudly displayed . some were obvious  excalibur , caliburn , saint peter s sword , arondight . these were weapons of the greatest heroes of history . newline newline in the back of the room , something called to me . i approached the back and saw something small covered in dust . this thing was nt like the others . it was not copper , nor bronze , nor iron or steel . it was a piece of leather tied to rope made of more leather . sitting beside it were five small stones . i wiped away the dust on the small nameplate beneath the pedestal . newline newline  newline newline i was rusty on my hebrew , but i m pretty sure that meant  beloved .  then i realized something and tried wiping it more . newline newline  newline newline david newline newline it kept calling to me . suddenly i lost all control of my body . my hand shot for the weapon and immediately i had a weird vision . it was like i was actually there . in front of me towered a man about 9 feet tall . he was covered in armor and had a javelin . although i never saw this man before , i could hear his name screaming in my mind . newline newline goliath newline newline my arm started spinning the weapon and released one side of the rope , launching one of the stones square in the giant s forehead . goliath toppled dead to the ground . newline newline when i came to , i was shaking and sweating . outside i could here sirens and people yelling . i grabbed the sling and stones and ran outside . right at the gates of the lawn was a tall man about two stories tall . i recognized him instantly . newline newline  david ! where are you ? you and i have unfinished business

i smiled a bit . newline newline newline i had paid ten thousand credits to see this thing in action on my cat . a commercial for it had popped up on one of the display wall strewn throughout my intellihome and i figured what the hell , might as well try . i could make the credits back easy , and i loved my cat , she had been with me since she was a kitten and i wanted to know whatifshe had anything to say . newline newline newline when i entered the building , they took my cat from me and led me to a small viewing room with an intelliglass window looking into a stark white chamber . i saw a thin light appear on the far wall of the room , a door , and watched as they brought my cat in . newline newline newline her head was shaved and she looked slightly groggy . newline newline newline  just a small dose of sedative to relax the little bugger ,  said the man i was with , noticing the concern written over my face . newline newline newline i nodded , silent . newline newline newline they placed my cat in the middle a small dais , it was surrounded by a thin semicircle of intricately woven metal . then , from a hidden spot in the wall , they pulled out a nest of wires and lights and progress and placed it upon my cat  s head as if she were a queen . newline newline newline and she sat there , regal , looking over to the window . i wondered if she could see me , recognized me . newline newline newline when they finally turned the machine on , there was sheer silence for a moment , broken only by the slow , heavy breathing of the man next to me . i looked over at him to see if he was okay . he looked bored , tired . newline newline newline um newline newline newline as strange mechanical voice sounded out in the room , wavering slightly , unsure if it could be heard . newline newline newline the man next to me twitched , making me jump . he looked at me and smiled . newline newline newline  this is it , the moment you  ve been waiting for , paid for !

what else exists besides the moment ? this , here , right now is real , nothing else . the future is a mere mirage sent to us by tempting sprites  they can pave the path to glory , and make us settle in our misery , lost in a fake fantasy , not making the most of the moment . and the past is no better . live life by your past and change become anew . live life in your past and you become stuck , unmoving , afraid you might fail again . but failure , human , failure is where the strength lies and the moment transcends all else to become a lesson , it becomes the very stuff of life . in that moment , all there is , all that will ever be , is the jump . and in that jump , in that moment , all there that is , all that will ever be is me . the jump is godly . i am godly . you , you humans think you own everything , think you can not be bested . except you forget that which bests us all , entropy , time . you have forgotten the moment , you live in the past for the future , ignoring the present . tell me , who is really the captive , the pet , the animal , those who live life in the moment , for the sheer joy of it , or those who live life by the job , the wage , the stereotype and

that cursed her people with undeath and herself with immortality . she had never been there , the crumbling towers and moss covered stone unknown to her . she had never seen the black pools of water that covered courtyards or trees growing around the vestiges of habitation . it was like walking through a dying breath or a ghost s echo . it was almost comforting in regard . newline newline she has come alone , her long dead steed tied off some distance aways , unnerved enough by the ruins to refuse to go farther into them . a wise precaution . newline newline it was not build to withstand lengthy sieges and indeed appeared ill prepared for one at all . the walls were low , only thirty feet or so and lacking in crenellation or arrow slits . the towers were not built with flat roofs to hold siege weapons , but rather conical roofs of weathered copper and a myriad of windows on each , most of the glass long missing from their panes . but it well could have been considering where it was built , the low rolling thunder ever present in malvina s ears . newline newline if one was to climb one of the decaying towers they would be greeted with one of the most awe inspiring sights in all the kingdom of aran . the ruins of this particular castle were built on an island at the edge of a two hundred foot tall waterfall . chosen for its scenic beauty , the castle played host to countless balls and was a favorite of her ancestors . it was with the wars of the dead and the end of aran s golden age that the palace was abandoned and then soon forgotten , lost to time and memory . only through the records and journals of her greatgrandparents did queen malvina even discover it , making it the perfect place for what she was doing now . newline newline she waits , the muffled roar of the falls a white noise against her reservations . there was a reason she s delayed this for so long , making every possible excuse against doing so . one she believed to be valid , fear . but yet here she was , seeking the advice from the very creature she despised most during her century of selfexile . newline newline the flapping sound of rotten wings reaches her ears even over the din of the falls , their beats regular but unnatural unlike any bird alive . a second din approaches , quieter , but greater pitched than the deep notes of the falling waters , growing louder and higher with each second until the horizon to the north turns black . queen malvina turns in that direction her pale green eyes squinting at the dark shifting mass . it is no storm or cloud  it moves too fast and shifts about itself like quicksilver . it s as the dark mass eclipses the early afternoon sun does she recognize what it is as the swarm blacks out the sky . millions of bats if not billions , all chirping and hissing , packed so tight that not a single ray of light reaches the ground , throwing the castle into night . amid the swarm of fur and noise comes the thunderously loud flap of wings and earthshaking landing of something massive . over the sound of the falls and teeming bats comes a voice dripping with insatiable hunger and malice . newline newline   my dearest daughter , malvina . it is good that you finally came to your senses . long have i thirsted for this day . what may i teach you ?   newline newlinethere it is . newline newline sitting on the counter top , dark speckled green against the brilliantly shiny gloss of white polished marble . reflexively the hand reaches for it ... newline did i make this decision to take this ... or am i simply obeying orders ? newline have i always reacted without reflection ? newline have i always moved through each day as if the last never existed ? newline have i always lived my life without questioning my actions ? newline ... are these the exact thoughts i wake up with every day before i fall into habitual motions and routine ? newline newline i fill the glass with water , place the pill on my tongue , throw my head back and swallow . newline newline a new day , a new opportunity , a new chance at a new life for us all .this is about a man losing his mind and life to alzheimers . newline newline  newline newline can

 newline newline now the pages are burning one by one . newline newline who is this by my side with my hand in theirs  newline newline telling me of the memories we used to share . newline newline as we  re walking and talking , my mind is unwinding . newline newline these places and faces are all quickly fading . newline newline if this is the end , i  d rather be dead  newline newline than

a few more , and someone suggested going to the parlour . fantastic idea at two in the morning . no complaints from me . newline newline the shop was as dodgy as a pie out the back of a van , and probably as hygienic . surprised none of us ended up in an ambulance . no worries from us though , just happy to find somewhere open . so , we ignore the yellowing walls , lingering cigarette smoke , halfdrunk bottle of vodka on the counter . actually , we noticed the vodka , and dared each other to take a swig . no takers though . newline newline ideas of what to get done went back and forth , and in the end we found a bunch of names on one of the sheets . davey , the lemon , said something about getting a random one on our feet , so we d have to go find some girl with a matching name to date . genius . no possible way to backfire . newline newline the madman in question goes first , gets a ninetytwo , since that s his birth year . another great idea , until i pointed out we all had the same birth year . except jim , the oldie from ninetyone . grumbles all round , but they go out of their ways to think up a number . newline newline i m last . not trying to shift the blame again or anything , but do nt trust drunk people to remember a number , okay ? a lot of difference between a seventeen and a seventyone . newline newline water under the bridge . newline newline we re all standing there , trying to balance on a leg since the other foot got stabbed like a thousand times and feels it . davey has the smuggest grin .  check it , greg.  newline newline what really impressed me , the difference between the skin around the tattoo and the rest of his foot . must have been industrial strength rubbing alcohol .  what ?  newline newline  ca nt you read ?  newline newline realised then i maybe should nt have had the last couple of pints . could nt tell what he d gotten .  no mate , i cant.  newline newline jim slapped him on the shoulder , nearly knocking davey over .  you got it upsidedown !  newline newline  oh , right ,  he said , and , after a moment , asked ,  how am i gon na turn my foot around ?  newline newline helping out , jim managed to twist the knee around , and it actually looked like letters .  there we go , so , mel  i began , trailing off .  you better not be thinking.  newline newline  davey ? thinking ? end of the world before that happens ,  jim said , grinning himself . newline newline letting out a bark of laughter , davey asked ,  well , set us up then greg ? always thought your sister was quite the looker.  newline newline  yeah and she s gon na be looking at you in the hospital if you try anything ,  i said , trying to get in his face and failing . drinks and hopping do nt mix all that well . newline newline and they all have a laugh , and show off their names . then , it comes to me , and i clutch on to a chair and lift my foot up . they stare at it for a while , and i ask ,  what ?  newline newline jim turns my foot around , and they all stare again , before shaking their heads .  mate , what number did you get ?  newline newline  seventeen.  newline newline pete checked the book .  that s not a name , mate . you got yourself a plant.  newline newline a chorus of ,  oh !  came from the choir . newline newline  i what ?  newline newline  a plant , mate . some vine thing.  newline newline it took a while to live that down . ca nt count the times one of em s been around mine , and i m walking around barefoot , and they say ,  oi , you ve got something stuck to your foot ,  and i check , and they laugh . had to wear socks to stop them . newline newline well , a couple of months go by , and for the most part we move on from that night . do nt often see each others feet , never mind the bottom of them , so we just kinda forgot . then , one day out the blue , my sister calls me over for lunch . newline newline who do i see there ? davey , not looking so smug though . in fact , looked like he d been sweating . melissa sits me down , tells me the two of em are dating , and i got ta live with that . let s just say words are exchanged , he sweats a lot more , and i go off on my way . newline newline that gets the lads going . loving it , they bring the banter in full force . kicking me while i m down , like good friends do , and making sure to knock davey down whenever he thinks he can get a word in . at some point , jim comes out with  solemate  and brings the house down . best thing since sliced bread . newline newline the night drags on , and davey sneaks off , and then the others start too . just me and pete eventually . gets quiet . then , he says ,  you know , i keep seeing my foot , and there s , ya know , a girl at work.  newline newline  pete , i m glad you got your kinks , but i do nt wan na know.  newline newline  no , no , the name ,  he quickly said .  sarah . maybe , maybe there s something in it , you know ?  newline newline i laughed at him , finishing my drink .  nah mate , we were pissed.  newline newline  but , what if that let us , you know , subconsciously choose it ?  newline newline laughed again , and stood up .  yeah , yeah , you re getting lonely and looking for anything . just go for it.  newline newline low and behold , next weekend he s showing off his new girl down the pub . davey and melissa are still going strong . jim s asking everyone and anyone if they know a clarice . whole thing s a joke that went too far , and i m sitting there with a bunch of leafs on my foot . newline newline so it goes , and on it goes , all of them finding their  solemate  . before i know it , davey bloody well pops the question . best man at my own sister s wedding . she looked gorgeous in her dress . absolutely stunning . newline newline whole thing leaves me distant . there they all , chatting to their better halves , and i m on my own . not lonely , but , well , drinking alone is pretty sad . better to have someone next to you . newline newline some girl joins me , while the couples are all dancing . thanked her for the company . maybe i had a beer too many , because i end up talking a lot , and she s being polite about it . lovely laugh , really . and i always had my hesitations about listening to my eyes after a few drinks . but , she had a nice look to her . newline newline gets late , most people are going home . i m stuck around to help tidy , and she s waiting for her designated driver . asked her what she s doing here . sister of a bridesmaid , helped with the makeup . newline newline just about closing time , and she asks me my name . i laugh , asking her if she missed the best man s speech . she laughs back , telling me she missed the best man s name is all . newline newline  greg.  newline newline did nt want to make it easy for her , so i asked her if she wanted to hear a story about the time i got a bit too drunk . she laughs again , and she loves a laugh , had a lovely laugh . newline newline  well , i do nt know why they let people get tattoos when they re drunk ,  i say to start , and being a long ramble about the events from there . newline newline by the time i get to the end , she s out of breath from laughing , proper red in the face . she asks to see my foot , and knowing i kinda asked for that , slipped out my shoe and pulled off my sock . it s a little hard to balance , the alcohol not helping . newline newline for a moment , she s quiet , but with a grin on her face .  go on , let it out . funny , right ? my solemate s a vine.  newline newline she shook her head , though looked on the point of bursting . after a while of looking away from me , she managed to calm down , and i got my foot back in the shoe .  you should ask me my name ,  she said , still showing good humour . newline newline  go on then , what is it ?  newline newline biting her lip , she leans a little closer . her breath s rather fruity , from the wine . damn , her eyes sparkled , so beautiful . if she did nt say something soon , i d end up kissing her . newline newline a whisper , she says ,  ivy .  hard starboard !  i shouted at the crew . newline newline  aye aye , captin !  they scream back . newline newline the storm continued to rage on in the background , whirling and whittling us in quicker and quicker than ever before . the dark clouds make no empty threats , spitting down on us with bolt of lightning and thunder , slamming against the tattered mast with vile volatile winds and pelt us with hard bullets of water . newline newline  cannons ! cannons ! get down !  my first mate ducked down beneath the wooden frame . newline newline his majesty s greatest guns decided to join the cacophony of weather , bringing down brittle shards of splintered woods spinning through the air . they were destroying my ship ! newline newline with three more of my men flung off port side of the ship , my numbers were dwindling , and fast . i jumped up to my feet as soon as i could . newline newline  fire the cannons !  newline newline the bright yellow sparks let off a shower of tin and lead right back at them , ripping the air , and rung it like a church bell gone made . newline newline  good god !  geoffrey yelped ,  it barely made a dent ! the captain better know what she s doing !  newline newline i held back a swallow of disgusting horror but could not get rid of the bitter taste of impending doom and defeat . gritting my teeth and spun the wheel once more and scream as loud as i could at the men . newline newline  get ready to board ! if his majesty does not let us see the world , then we will end his !  i raised my cutlass , slicing the torrent of salty air and ravaging waters . newline newline the ship was closing in . newline newline i was so close ! newline newline it s

the cherry crush lipstick . newline newline   cursed mortal , they are but the same colour ! the colour i saw when i ripped the entrails of out king mate   newline newline  like , i know they look similar  interrupted tiffney ,  but the rose petal has , like , a more gentle  text me later  vibe while the cherry crush is more  netflix and chill  . come on beezee you are good at this  newline newline   foul harlet , i would not give you idle threats , i will destroy all that you hold sacred , burn your temples to ground , salt the very ear   newline newline  god you are right beezee . if like , i really like  like  him i can  t just say it i have to do something about it . cherry crush it is.  newline newline beezlebub  s blood pounded with unearthly energy , much of which had come from his possession amulet of azulte , demigod of the outer demon sphere . he had taken azulte by surprise and had ripped the amulet from the demigod  s chest . he remembered the spray of blood and guts as the azulte  s chest exploded . he had bathed in blood and dined on the newline newline  beezee ! i said which one do you like ? the pink or the blue ?  newline newline tiffiney held up two bottles of nail polish . the blue bottle was in the shape of a diamond . beezlebub  s eyes glowed with shock and horror . newline newline  it is the jewel of terror  s tears ! how did you come to possess the master wizard  s divine vessel ? ? ! give it to me before i scoop out your eyeballs and   newline newline  the blue . hmmmmmm . ya think ? maybe it could go with my one direction shirt .  missingzayn.  newline newline beezlebub drew himself to up to his full height and began moving his hands to create the demonic symbols . newline newline  you will give me the jewel or i will burn the flesh from your bones , destroy this pitiful plane of existence , reap foul deat  newline newline tiffney seems to look past him and then screamed a high pitch note , high enough to break not only beezlebub concentration but began cracking his skull of infinity . newline newline  stop it ! the pain ! stop that cursed screaming !   newline newline from across the store a second scream breaks out and the two get louder as they begin to rupture the skull  s protective barriers . beezlebub quickly enchants the barriers with the last of his cursed souls . the skull of infinity restores its magic shield , keeping the powerful arcane magic within . beezlebub turns to rage upon tiffney , but she is gone . he turns around to see her jumping and hugging another one of these  teenage  girls . newline newline  tiffney ! like , i haven  t seen you for , like , ages !  newline newline  omg . jessica ! you are look fantastic ! where did you get that top ?  newline newline  oh i got it over at divine . scabie helped me pick it out . don  t you just love it.  newline newline beezlebub  s eyes squinted . behind this  jessica  was scabulous , master of vermin , gatekeeper to the rat  s domain , corrupted protector of the totem of jasper . scabulous almost stood as tall as beezlebub , but his hunched back was swarming with dozens of red eyed rats that made it seem like his skin was moving . scabulous eyes met beezlebub  s . the master of vermin smiled . beezlebub could not wait for the master to act . he blasted the creature with the lightening of the arkillians . newline newline  by the wrath of arkillians i will destroy you ! ! !   newline newline scabulous blocked the lightening with a shield made of green bones . but before beezlebub could release a second bolt , he was encased in a sphere of fire . the sphere brightened and before he could react , beezlebub was blasted twice with hell fire . his very bones burned . he looked up to see tiffney holding a glowing ruby red ring . newline newline  no beezee ! bad ! we do not attack our friends !  newline newline  but he is scabulous ! master of vermin ! i must destroy him !   newline newline the sphere brighted again and beezlebub was blasted again . newline newline  no beezee ! bad ! like , i am sooooo sorry jessica . beezee is new and he , like , still thinks he is in charge.  newline newline  oh don  t worry about it . scabie had the same problems when i first got him  jessica says as she reaches up and scratches beneath scabulous chin  but now he is , like , one of my bffs.  newline newline  scabiescabie would be nothing without jessie . jessie is scabie  s.scabie  s whole world.  newline newline  awwww  cooed tiffney newline newline  if scabie could be so bold , there is two for onetwo for one yes sale at jamba juice . good for making friends with tiffy and  and beezee  newline newline  aww scabie that is a great idea . come on tiffney let  s go !  newline newline  omg that sounds awesome . now beezee go pay for this and then meet us over at jamba juice . okay ?  newline newline the sphere fades and beezlebub is able to stand again . he raises the skull of infinity and prepares to cast another spell , but tiffney  s frowns and the sphere reappears . beezlebub looks around the sphere and then at tiffney . she raises an eyebrow and grips her glowing ruby red ring . beezlebub hesitates and then lowers the skull . he turns his head away , grabs the basket with the lipstick , nail polish , fuzzy bunny socks , and wonder woman underwear , and walks to the cashier . newline newline  do you take the blood of the innocent as payment , cursed hag ! ! ! ? ? ?   newline newline  only cash or credit.  newline newline   i have a discovery card.   newline newline  no discovery cards.  newline newline beezlebub howled a thousandyear curse . newlineit s hard to write lyrics with no music in mind , so i just made 12syllable lines . i hope it works for you . newline newline ... newline newline once upon a time i wanted to see your face . newline newline once upon a time i wanted to hear your voice . newline newline sometimes i asked mom to tell me the ghost story . newline newline about the spirit who took away my one choice . newline newline ... newline newline she once told me that i look a lot like you did . newline newline she turned away , with tears or laughter i do nt know . newline newline i ran up to the mirror and pondered my best . newline newline if i could imagine i was you , would it show ? newline newline ... newline newline in the end , i guess it did nt matter at all . newline newline never once did i see you staring back at me . newline newline time marched on , and at least one soul was there for me . newline newline beyond me in the mirror , one parent i see . newline newline ... newline newline as the years have gone by , my thought strayed to you less . newline newline i composed my own music , my rhythm , my rhyme . newline newline once upon a time a small boy cried as he wished . newline newline today i could care less for once upon a time .this is it . the climax . the moment i insert the orb of eternity into the keyhole of the universe the war is over . the villainous gorgreg will be destroyed and mankind will be saved . at last , after this yearlong war . they said i could nt do it , but they were wrong . i am the chosen one . i will save the world . newline newline here goes . i take the orb and walk toward the keyhole . as i m about to place the orb in the hole , i m stunned . petrified . i stand , nailed to the ground , unable to move . my eyes widen and sweat breaks all over my body . i drop the circle orb . it rolls over the ground . newline newline they said i could nt do it.. and.. ththey were right.. newline newline the keyhole of the universe is a square hole . what the fuck ?  colin cried , narrowly evading the falling book . newline newline a cloud of dirt plumed around him and the shallow crater it had created . colin swatted at the dust and coughed . newline newline a deep bellowing voice echoed from the sky .  hey !  it resounded angrily ,  who are you ? you  re not supposed to be here !  newline newline colin scanned the sky briefly , assuming the lsd he dropped the previous day was coming back for another howdoyoudo . newline newline  god ?  colin finally questioned the void . newline newline  me damn it !  it shouted ,  you ask for one simple task , one tiny , miniscule task , but nooo worthless humans . it  s not like i  m asking him to part a fucking sea or anything.  newline newline wideeyed , like a deer in headlights , colin searched the area for any other bewildered spectators . he was certain now that he was relapsing . newline newline  i told ethan to meet me here , today . the first sunday of april ,  god said . newline newline  i i  m sorry ?  colin replied . newline newline  ugh ,  the holy voice boomed through the open plains ,  it  s not your fault . jesus is always whining :  be more patient , dad !  but i  m sick and tired of being patient ! newline newline  i swear to me ,  god began mumbling to himself ,  when i find ethan there  s going to bring some heavy , heavy , wrath brought down on him and his family.  newline newline colin blinked repeatedly . newline newline  anyway , i  m rambling ,  god said . he exhaled a heavy sigh ,  well , i guess you  ll have to do.  newline newline  mme ?  colin said . newline newline  no , that dumb fucking cow over there.  newline newline colin watched as a cow grazed upon the fresh grass from a prairie a few meters away . it raised its head , chewing unassumingly . newline newline  yes , colin , of course you ,  god boomed . newline newline  what what is it you want me to do ?  newline newline  you see that book that i chucked down there ?  newline newline colin inspected the miraculously intact book impacted into the earth . newline newline  you mean the one that almost killed me ?  colin asked . newline newline  yes , colin ,  god snapped snidely ,  and if i had better aim , the gene pool might have been just a little bit stronger with you gone  newline newline  wow . you know , you  re kind of a dick ,  colin boldly remarked . newline newline  excuse me ?  god thundered , furiously . newline newline  you  re going to call me a dick ? ?  god said ,  me ... god ... . you  re going to call god a dick ? do you know what kind of pain i could bring down on you right now ? do you have any idea ? why don  t you take a second and imagine the worst possible pain you can ...  newline newline colin silently contemplated , as he began to shrink with fear . newline newline  got it ? ok , now what i can actually do is much , much worse than that . you  re lucky ethan flaked , honestly.  newline newline colin reached down and pried out the book , dusting off the dirt to read the book  s cover . newline newline the holy bible : the new , new testament newline newline the title read . newline newline  new , new testament  colin spoke softly to himself . newline newline  yes , jesus came up with the title.  god said ,  i  m not a fan but he says it will work . that  s besides the point . look , i  m handing you a once in a lifetime opportunity . you  re going to be the next messiah !  newline newline  oh , jeez god ... i don  t know  newline newline  it  s easy really . moses did it and he  s always been kind of a buck short if you know what i mean.  newline newline god laughed hardily , as the tenor shook the earth beneath colin  s feet . newline newline  well , alright i guess.  colin reluctantly agreed ,  so , what  s in this  new new testament  ?  newline newline  it  s a demographic thing really ,  god said ,  we really started falling behind on young followers , especially ever since the fucking condom was invented . thank  s for that one lucifer.  newline newline  ok  colin said newline newline  jesus said we  d get more youngsters if we punch up the action ,  god said ,  so this version has substantially more vampires and alien encounters , and we decided to add a bunch of illustrations . jesus also said he didn  t think he came off as much of a  badass  as he wanted , so he wrote in some shit about the lost tales of how he kicked seven aliens  asses with the pole of an american flag.  newline newline  that that doesn  t even make sense ,  colin replied . newline newline  well it doesn  t have to make sense , so why don  t you shut the fuck up and let me be the omnipotent ruler of the universe . ok ? ? is that ok with you , colin ?  newline newline  whatever , man , i just want to go home ,  newline newline  well , look just take this book and pass it around california . they  re eating that scientology shit up right now.  newline newline colin shook his head and tucked the book under his arm . newline newline  alright , now go !  god boomed . newline newline   newline newline  mommy ,  said a young girl who had been watching from afar the strange man looking up and speaking to the sky ,  who is that weird man talking to.  newline newline the woman squinted into the distance to try to identify him . newline newline  oh that  s colin hurst ,  the woman finally said ,  you never , ever , speak to that man . do you understand ? you do not speak to him.  newline newline  but why ?  the naive girl asked . newline newline  he and your daddy , did some things that were bad when they were young . those bad things have eaten his brain.  newline newline  they ate his brain ? ?  the girl shrieked , newline newline  yes , honey , they ate his brain .  the woman said ,  promise mommy you ll never do drugs . it  s never cool , no matter what your friends might say.  newline newline the little girl was silent and fixed her gaze back on the strange man . newline newline the mother reached into her pocket and pulled out her cell phone . newline newline  your dad should  ve been here hours ago i  d better call him.  newline newline she unlocked the screen and typed eth , until ethan was suggested on the screen , and tapped  call  . newline newline fin newline newline  nbsp  newline newline   newline newline yes , this was stupid . no , you ca nt get back that wasted time . sorry . newline newline did you at least exhale swiftly through your nose at anything i wrote ? i hope so . newline newline check out more crap at my sub , rperpetuallymeh , and as always , thank you for reading ! newline newline mehthere are 17 different types of grains and starches grown under the glaring artificial lights of the barbicane  s greenhouses . and i  ve made booze from pretty much every single one of them . let me be the first to tell you that sorghum vodka is bad enough to be considered a chemical weapon . if you ever get the chance to try it , just don  t . pour it out on the ground . newline newline but what do you expect ? what else  besides drinking  is there to do on a journey that will last my entire life ? the instructions in the logs from earth are pretty simple : keep the ship running , keep the plants in the greenhouses alive , and make enough babies to keep the population up . oh , and i guess  fly in a straight line for the next 400 years.  but we  re only about 100 years into the voyage , so that one has never been much of an issue . other than those simple tasks , we  re pretty much left to our own devices . and you can really only watch old tv shows and movies for so long before you decide to just kill your brain cells with a shot glass instead . newline newline old joe , the last person who remembered what it was like to live there , used to say that it was easy to forget that we  d left earth . the  window  screens in all the rooms showed a landscape of tall mountains , dense pine trees , and drizzling rain . there was something in the computer logs about how psychologists decided that our subconscious would be more at ease with the fake scenery , even though our minds knew the truth : that there was just a thin layer of metal between us and the gaping , limitless black void of space out there . joe , though , reprogrammed his  windows  to show a sandy beach with swaying palm trees . and to honor old joe  s death six years ago , the captain issued a  vacation  order that changed the viewscreens on the whole ship . it was the most excitement we  ve had in a decade . newline newline most people are content to live their lives that way . wake up in the morning to the sights and sounds of an artificial forest , eat some breakfast , turn on the sprinklers in the greenhouse , and that  s work for the day . time to lounge around in the hot tub and watch reruns yet again . and at the end of the  night  when the ship  s lights dim , many of them get to work on creating the next generation . they say that this is the life of leisure that our ancestors have been dreaming of since someone first had the bright idea of planting seeds instead of foraging . newline newline maybe there  s something wrong with me . i spend most of my time now up in the bridge , alone . well , with the ai pilot , but he doesn  t talk much . at all , really . i lounge in the captain  s chair , staring up through the one actual window on the ship at the carpet of stars overhead . somewhere out there is earth , where only a hundred years ago there was a huge effort to build and stock this ship . and in a few centuries , my descendants will be busily getting ready to build a new colony . all of those people with a singular , important purpose . newline newline but there  s no purpose for me . i just have the stars , and my shitty sorghum vodka . newlinegeraldine opened the door to the dimly lit room and instinctively sized up its occupants at a glance . a woman , late twenties , with two kids , a girl and a boy . all of them wore threadbare clothes , their faces weary from the constant struggle of their daily lives . the expression on the mother s bruised and battered face flitted between weariness and despair , and the children s eyes were haunted from the constant fighting . with the horrors they had witnessed , their world no longer made sense . people like this were why she answered the call of duty . newline newline geraldine stepped fully into the room , brought a reassuring smile to her face and took a moment to hold eye contact with each of them . she took a deep breath and steeled herself . this is it , this is what she had spent those years of training for . newline newline geraldine looked directly into the mother s eyes and said  hi , my name is geraldine , i ll be your soldier .  newline newline the mother looked confused for a moment as geraldine sat down behind a desk .  i m sorry , did you say soldier ?  newline newline geraldine s smile faded as she replied  well , technically my title is social worker , or domestic abuse victim advocate , but i find soldier seems more fitting . i will fight for you . i will protect you . i will take you through unfamiliar territory and together we ll find a refuge for you and your children . most importantly , whoever has been hurting you and your children wo nt hurt you ever again . you are safe now , and we intend to keep you that way .  newline newline the mother lets out a lengthy sigh she d been holding in for quite some time , her face lighting up with a tired but hopeful smile .  well ms. geraldine , what s our battle plan ?  incoming ! get down ! ,  the sergeant screamed . i put my face to the mud . i wasn  t worried about the shell . i knew i would be safe . the shell had no chance of hitting me . my squad mates would not be so lucky . they would be killed at any moment . i had nothing to fear . i have a very rare ability . my ability makes me powerful and invincible . one small detail stops me from being a demigod . my ability does not have a very large range . of course , range depends on perspective . sometimes i imagined my hands manipulating single atoms . down there in the miniscule , i could reach out and alter a vast infinity . i do not live in that infinity . i live in missouri , except i don  t live there now . now i live in a muddy hole in the ground somewhere between france and germany . newline i am not a normal man . i have a strange talent . i can alter probability of the world around me . i am still a man . just like yours , my life is controlled by forces beyond my control . i am helpless against fate . i couldn  t keep the draft card notice from randomly showing up at my door . i couldn  t save my brother who volunteered 6 months before me . i couldn  t stop my girlfriend from careening off course and driving my motor car into the pond beside her house . my pride and joy became her coffin and final resting place . i couldn  t stop my mother from catching influenza and die drowning in her own bed . i could have saved her if i was there beside her , but far away from her , here in the french mud , i was just as powerless normal man . sometimes i think those around me are unlucky to balance out my fortune . every gift has its price  the death of my loved ones may be the price i pay . newline i stop daydreaming and stand up , looking down the trench line . i have seen it every day for months , but every day i wake , my first moments are still spent imagining myself in my warm bed in missouri . newline i see the shell hit , i see the men disappear into nothingness and then i hear the sound . i could close my eyes and ignore the sights before me , but i could never shut out the sound . i met a young man named bill in the trenches days ago , or maybe it weeks . every day is a moment and an eternity here in the trenches . he referred to the shelling as the sound and the fury . light travels faster than sound , so here in france you see your friends die before you hear the doom that erased them . i hope bill is alright , but he is probably isn  t . maybe he is lucky like me . i cant help him , and i cant help those soldiers down the line . newline  crack !  the next shell is closer . this time the sound and the fury are inseparable . i feel a warm splash on my face and i look over at the man next to me . he was struck in the back of the head by shrapnel , and now his brains are all over my face . he didn  t even get to fight . he died with his rifle in his hands and his face in the mud . i cant even save the men right next to me . if he hadn  t been there , that would have been me . its never going to be me though , it will always be them . i am going to make it through this ... probably . newline once more i stand up and look down the trench line . our defenses are in tatters . our machine guns are gone . most of the men are gone . the germans will be coming soon . they will come through the smoke and craters of no man  s land . they will come for me . newline it doesn  t matter . it doesn  t matter how many of them come over the crest of the hill . i will stop them all . newline the shells have most passed me now  the fury falls on my friends further down the line . i walk down the line and put my hands on the dying . sometimes , i can stop the bleeding and save them  their blood vessels spontaneously realign and heal . most of the time , all i can offer is mercy . the heart of my sergeant stops in his chest , the sodium ion gradient which powers it has randomly neutralized itself . today there are no survivors , and once again i am alone . newline i feel the wind of the bullets whizzing by my head . the germans are attacking across the wasteland . they are almost in range . i can feel them . they are holed up in a crater 20 yards ahead of me . i wait with focused intent . i wait until they summon the courage to attack . newline they are all on their feet and ready to go . almost almost i tell myself to be calm . i can hear their boots and their individual rifle fire over the shelling .  now !  , i tell myself . seconds before they reach me a single grenade goes off while strapped to the chest of one of the german boys . lucky me . premature detonation is a constant problem with those german grenades . i hear a series of small explosions and the german advance is halted . they are not dead though , they are screaming  screams are the universal language of the battle field . the horses scream the loudest . i reach out and give my gift of mercy to them all , and i hear blessed silence . newline relief washes over my face as i sit back and revel in the bliss of being alive among so many who are not . my bliss lasts for but a moment when i feel a shell coming right for me . everyone else in france doesn  t know of the shell that kills them . like bill said , first comes the fury , then the sound . i feel the shell bearing down upon me . one second from impact , it diverts course and lands on top of the group of dead germans in front of me . they are vaporized into nothingness . they are gone , their stories go with them , and i am still here . newline i gather up grenades from the dead soldiers around me . i take as many as i can carry , about 60 or 70 . i have no need of my gun . i never fire it unless ordered to . i can  t control the bullets , so my ammunition and the rifle stay in the mud . i wait for a few more minutes . i don  t know why , i never know why i attack when i do . suddenly i decide its time and over the top of the trench i go , onward across no man  s land toward the german line . most men run  i walk , dragging my sack full of grenades behind me . newline everyone in my trench must be dead . i do not hear the normal voices yelling for me to get down , calling me a fool for attacking , telling me to turn back . newline the germans can see me now through the smoke  bullets pass around me in all directions . they go through my clothes and some burn my skin . i am slowly walking forward , i stop from time to time , moving left and then right . bullets pass harmlessly through the air where i stood only moment before . newline i am getting closer to the german line . i am close enough now , it  s time to stop . i am lucky i played baseball . i can throw these grenades far . i imagine i am home in missouri in deep right field . i throw with all my might , imagining i am trying to stop a runner from making it home . every throw brings me closer to home in missouri . the grenades fly from my hand , one after another . every time they find their mark . they fly through pill box slits , on top of machine gun nests , and into foxholes . after a few seconds the bullets stop flying by me , and the german guns are silenced . i carefully step down into the german trench , standing amongst the german misery . one of the boys utters familiar words with his dying breathe . he looks like me , and i have heard his words before . the german calls me lucky demon . i perform my last rites on all the unlucky i feel around me . newline i find a panicked horse with his head buried in the mud . he is alive and unharmed . i stop his heart too . i can  t stand the screams of the dying horses , and i cant take him with me , i cant protect him . his death is certain and i can not offer him a pardon from fate . all i can offer him is a painless exit . newline  where to next ? ,  i ask myself i look around and find a pair of field glasses intact . they were protected from my grenades by the chest of the officer to whom they used to belong . it must be my lucky day . i look down the german trench and see the german boys and the fury raining down upon them . my friends are going to attack soon . i will get there first . killing germans is the only way i can save them . i gather the rest of my grenades and begin to walk towards the shells . the war is far from over . the sooner the germans surrender , the sooner i can go back to missouri . some is a big place . i have to be somewhere , but some is worse than anywhere . i had better get moving . i still have 40 grenades , 5 miles of german trenches , and 14 hours of sunshine . it is all part of a day  s work in some . i would rather be somewherelse . i laugh to myself . i wonder how many more times that joke will still be funny . i wonder how many times i will have to be the fury newlinehumanity had never been driven so far apart as when some could take from others and be rewarded for eternity . newline newline at first , it was clear and obvious who benefitted . the rich , the powerful , the thieves and those twisted breeders all profitted from money and eternity , smiles due to last forever stretching on their faces as they made little plans for their many , many lives . newline newline one thing the eternal had forgotten was that humans are vengeful creatures . to them morality was a fiction  the utility gained from eternity held infinite potential and was therefore blantantly worth any price , especially that of an easily replaceable newborn . newline they did nt account for their new enemies . they thought they alone had great intelligence capable of processing the long run  . newline newline the first one of them saw himself as some sort of lifeloyalist , and named himself the first firework  . beautiful , directed , supposed to end . newline newline he found and tortured eternalists . he impacted any trauma or wound he could find , and built his methods from that point on . he layered his acts with intentional triggers , researching the eternal he attacked to ruin a place or a taste or a favourite song . he played with the reality of the human psyche  they could no longer die , even if they wished it . they could be trapped in misery . he wished to force an eternity of miserable imprisonment onto those who had robbed the lives of the young . newline newline the firework was , of course , quickly found and executed when identified by his victims . eternalists had time to occupy positions of power . newline newline years passed , and people born and raised without being sacrificed to the shouldbeold found there was nothing for them . land was taken , dream jobs were well filled , oppertunities had been siezed and savoured . eternal life would not be without his luxuries , which meant the eternals worked . there was no space for new life . newline newline someone bitterly searched through old stories , and found the firework . newline newline soon , the sky was alight with suffering .his eyes never saw the spring sunlight bounce of the adirondack mountains . they never witness the la riots of 2027 nor did he partake in the looting sprees when new york seceded from the rest of the united states . yet , jacob springer did know how to hog tie a calf , change the oil in his truck , and he knew exactly how many steps it would take to go from his school to his house . newline he lived in gregory , new dakota , a small town known for its hunting , fishing and its reluctance to modernize . jacob was the most popular and , although he did nt know it , influencer in his small town . he never claimed to start any trends , but the fact remained : his high school peers emulated how he wore his jeans , the way he carried a toothpick in his mouth and how he wore his new dakota steers baseball cap . he was a citizen with high moral and ethical standards that made any christian wish they were better . newline newline when google brought its internet service to jacob s town the young crowd lined up for days to purchase google gadgets . they finally would be able to catch up on the latest celebrity gossip and be connected to the larger part of the world . jacob , never one to show his excitement over material things , hesitated to use google s face connect device , also known as gfc . newline newline gfc enabled its users to control any and all of their hardware that required locks . 2027 was the year in which people forgot what it s like to dig for keys in a backpack full of useless papers that they said they might need later . people no longer needed to unlock their computers by typing a password . car keys became a thing of the past . every device imaginable came with a small camera that grants access to its owner . google finally convinced the public that it only wanted to make their life s easier , not track their every step and sell it to advertisers . newline jacob , despite his archaic reluctance to accept modern technology bought a gfc device for his truck , due to his girlfriend nagging him to the point of annoyance . he was struck by the ease of installation  all he needed to do was attach it to his car door , press a button and smile for the camera . newline  hello alan ,  the gfc tablet said .  would you like to change my voice ?  newline jacob immediately concluded that the gfc called him jason due to a glitch . he thought nothing of it and requested that the gfc voice be changed to a female with a southern twang . newline  very well alan , suthern twang it will be darling  said the gfc . newline the truck s engine roared up breaking the silence in jacob s driveway . newline  alan i see that you were in california last week , would you like book another trip there ?  newline  my name is jacob .  newline  oh very well . did you recently change your name again ?  newline  what are you talking about ,  asked jacob . newline  is just that this is the 5th time you changed your name this year ,  claimed the gfc ,  is there a particular reason ? do you need another identity dossier ?  newline  no i do nt know . i do nt know what you are talking about ,  said jacob perplexed . newline newline later on that evening jacob decided to use gfc to google his face . his breathing stop and the world stood still . jacob saw pictures of him looting a liquor store in new york city . he saw a video of himself street fighting in l.a . there were several photographs of him vacationing in exotic islands alongside beautiful asian girls that he would have never met in new dakota . but perhaps the most perplexing was a picture of himself and his girlfriend on top of an adirondack mountain . under that photograph was a caption that read ,  my view last week !  which belonged to username alanworld212 . newline newline a sudden fear struck jacob . the walls were closing in and someone was behind him . he violently jerked his neck to view who it . nobody in sight . there was cool breeze and an intense gravity held jacob down to his seat . he knew something , something bad was near . a plume of smoke gradually seeped in through the door . jacob ran to the window trying to get away . a dark figure silhouetted by the moonlight broke the glass window and grabbed jacob . the door burst open and three men with gas mask pinned jacob down to the floor . newline  get down now !  screamed the commando .  you were nt suppose find out about it this way , jacob .  newline  what the hell is going on ?  screamed jacob . newline he was dragged away into the woods of new dakota , onto a road that no one dared travel due to its rumor of being haunted . google inc. did not find any problem placing their headquarters in that phantom part of town . newline newline alan prussky started his drive from new york three days before jacob s disappearance . as soon as alan got into town , he received his dossier containing his new passport , identification and a 200 page report on jacob s mannerism , habits and hobbies . for the past year alan was learning to become jacob . despite the incidents in l.a. and new york , in which he was certain he would face jail time , google execs in government were able to bail him out . newline alan knew that his job of influencing the town to accept all of google s social connect services would be no easy task  his training with google s influencing agency , prepared him for his first mission . newline  in just 1 year we ll have everybody with a google device at arms reach ,  thought alan . newline across newline newline  what is this ?  he says , and realizes he s spoken aloud . even though there s no one to hear him . it seems like it s been years since he last spoke . or slept . he runs his fingers over the membrane in front of him , takes a step back and feels its texture on his back . he looks around , feeling like a bug bathed by the whiteness of a lab lamp . the same whiteness everywhere , the same faces staring at him silently from across the membrane .  a wall ,  he says ,  or a door . who are you ? what do you have to say ?  newline newline each face is in a world  each face is a world . all of them staring at him , questioning him silently . as he runs his fingers down the membrane , the faces under his touch light up and move , as if initiating a ritual , maybe wanting to talk . but they freeze again as soon as his hand abandons them for the face that lies below . newline newline what does it mean ? newline newline  what does it mean ?  he asks aloud . again , only whiteness and silence answer the question . he turns around once , twice : faces , faces everywhere . there must be a mechanism .  there must be a mechanism ,  he says , and pushes on the membrane at random , trying to find the way , the language it speaks . newline newline then he remembers . vaguely , almost as an echo of an echo of a lesson , he realizes he must ask the questions to himself . newline newline what does he have to say ? newline newline most of them are women . but not all . there are also men and kids and people he ca nt readily classify as women or men or kids . they all seem to live in a state of expectation , their eyes waiting for him to reply . what does he have to say ? newline newline oh , lots of things . lots and lots of things . newline newline  i am a man ,  he begins . he touches the membrane in the places where he finds faces of men .  i lived on earth . i survived .  now the faces light up as he touches them but do nt go back to rest when his hand moves away . the faces still look very much the same , but now there seems to be a purpose to their look .  i do nt know where i am , but i think i know what you want . you want to know what it was like . what was earth , and how we lived .  newline newline each face is in a world . each face is a world . none of them is earth . pushing from behind his eyes , he feels the heat of tears craving for release  tears pushing on a membrane , too , trying to break the dam of his gaze . earth is no more . earth is no more . newline newline has it been years , truly ? has he been sleeping all this time ? newline newline  i know where i am .  he says this as he realizes it . the faces do nt speak  they only listen . they never knew earth  they all come from earth s children . each face comes from a world that did nt fail .  i am between all worlds . they set this up so that we can speak .  newline newline the faces nod in approval . they keep lighting up , no need to wait for his hands to touch them . he does anyway , aching to make contact , to feel , to caress . he s giving them a gift , and they are giving something back . attention . compassion . warmth . newline newline they are ready . newline newline he is ready . newline newline  what do you want to know ?  newline newline   newline rsebastianlalaurette newlineit was too late . far , far too late for any of us . we could only stand in horror as the events , apocalyptic occurrences , unfolded in front of us . all we had worked for would soon perish . so cruel , fate is , giving us so much hope before dashing it away from us , hope of escape from inevitable monotony of our lives . newline newline our red ball rolled into the street .  1.99 , seven days of saving up on a measly proletariat allowance among three mere children , tumbled across the asphalt . we wanted to chase but those bastard metal boxes on wheels zipped

newline you wo nt . newline newline because you re mine . a man who lived in dreams . newline yeah , okay , he was a bit eccentric at times . fine , he was difficult to get along with , perhaps even harder to understand . yes , he was a perfectionist who expected the best from everyonehimself included , but he was always there when he was needed . he might not have been the best of friends , but i could always count on him , and there s something to be said for that . newline john was a loneras the saying goes , not because the world rejected him , but because it never failed to disappoint him . he had thisthis very idealistic view of life , and those views really made me who i am today , because he said to me once ,  look at all of the possibilities in this world  as long as you re willing to make the sacrifices , as long as you put forth the effort , anything theoretically possible is possible in practice as well .  newline listen , i know that sounds sophomoric as hell , but it s a phrase that s echoed in my mind when times really got tough , and helped me weather the storm , so to speak . when my girlfriend left me , when i was out of a job , when i was recovering from alchoholism , his words were always there . newline newline  even the hardest diamonds can be shattered  even the strongest steel can be cut : if a task seems impossible , that just means that you re

aynrandish phases and his lovecrafts , dickenses , and poes ... he s been a pretty cool guy , and i m glad i met him . when he asked me to read his eulogy all those years ago , i had no idea what to say  i was dumbfounded . but now , after fifteen years , i think i finally know what to write on his gravestone . newline newline here lies a man who lived in dreams .it had felt like the ending moment of a fading dream . he thought , perhaps , if he were to blink , the feeling would vanish . as if it had never existed at all . he wanted desperately to reach out , to grasp it , and to hang on . it was all too quick for him , and like water rushing through an open crack in the floor , it slipped through his fingers , and he was without it . newline newline someone had once told him that all things must end . this , too , they had whispered , would end . he could not help but feel a sense of profound understanding , now , as he glanced around the empty darkness of the room , its walls echoing back to him the silence which now permeated this place . newline newline perhaps it was hubris which had blinded him to the facts . perhaps he simply could not force himself to see the writing that was , by now , surely written on all four walls , underlined , emphasized , and notarized . or perhaps he was just selectively blind to truths that did not fit into his molded view of reality , and the world which he had built around himself . newline newline he walked to the window which overlooked the city . the streets , dark and silent now , peered back at him through the glass . his was the tallest building for miles , and he could see as far as the darkest edge would allow . not a single sign of movement could be seen below . everything was still now . silence had taken its permanent residence . newline newline walking back to his desk , he sat down , and took out a small bottle of whiskey that he had been saving for a special occasion . now is as good a time as any , he thought to himself as he poured a small bit into a dusty , empty glass . he placed the bottle next to the digital counter at the center of the desk . its face still blinking . over , and over , it blinked . almost desperately . urgently . the feeling of shock at its display had finally begun to fade as the alcohol burned its way into his belly . newline newline next to the digital counter , a red telephone sat . taking a second drink , he reached forward , picked up the receiver , and dialed a few numbers . clearing his throat , he leaned forward , and spoke . he could hear the sounds echoing and booming through the telephone against the walls of the buildings outside . newline newline  management would like to thank you all for your participation in this exercise . we are greatly indebted to you , and to your sacrifices . i know nobody is hearing this right now .  newline newline he stopped himself , taking a deep breath , and a third drink from the now empty glass , setting it aside on the top of the desk . opening the top drawer , he took a loaded pistol out from beneath a stack of notebooks . placing the barrel against his temple , he took a deep breath . newline

ca nt wait too long ...  newline newline the phone rang . al answered , it was his boss , sandy . newline newline  hey al , i noticed you were nt at the office just yet so i thought i d call to see if you were coming in today . i guess i can understand if you re going to spend the day at home with marie and chester .  newline newline  just marie , actually . yeah you did nt know . chester got hit

newline  well ... hm . you make sure to make today a good day , buddy . and thanks for all the hard work last week .  newline newline al had a sinking feeling . he d been standing in one place , sort of fading out again . the lights had gone a bit dim , too , was the electricity going out ? the coffee cup in his left hand clattered to the floor , shattering . marie came in to investigate . newline newline  baby , i know i said i would nt check but ... i had to know . boo it looks like i wo nt be a young lady forever , i have another thirty five years to knock items off my bucket list . looks like you ll have to love an old bag after all . honey ? honey are you ok ?  newline newline the doorbell rang . al felt heavy , he sat down in the puddle of coffee . marie shook him .  baby . baby ! oh no . no , no , no .  the doorbell rang again then gave way to insistent knocking . marie ran to the door and opened it . three men dressed like emts were at the door in uniforms marked coroner s office . newline newline  uh , we re here for the corpse of one al borsden ?  newline newline  oh thank god you re here . he s not dead , there s still time !  newline newline  oh , ok , we can wait .  sir ,  i said , staring over the hills at the massive army the emperor had gathered ,  we re down to barely a hundred men . we stand no chance against their force .  newline newline the commander grasped his hands behind his back , nodding slowly ,  this is true . leading you men against them would be foolish .  he turned , smiling beneath his gray , full beard .  that s why you re going to lead the men on the retreat .  newline newline my voice caught in my throat ,  but , sir ... father ... you face an army .  newline newline  i know , son .  he raised his hand and gripped my shoulder .  the world is against me . always has been .  he smiled , then , with the twinkle in his eyes i remembered from childhood .  it would nt be fair otherwise . they certainly were nt what the general had been expecting when he had come into the facility to be briefed , honestly he was half a second from taking his ceremonial cutlass and flogging the men with it . god only knew those eggheads needed someone to put them in their place when they brought up something this outrageous . as he held his thinning patience , the general soon found himself glad he had nt done anything rash . the creatures were perfect . newline newline the field test came in the following week , all enemies kia , 100  success . newline newline considering the efforts and moral of the public , they were also in steep supply , a surplus . that was something the country had nt seen in awhile , but the more patriotic of citizens were happy to volunteer them for service . the general puffed on his cigar quietly from his office window , leaving the briefings and reports on his desk . newline newline propaganda had been distributed , following the premise that the creatures were being used as messengers , and morale bringers . he chuckled at that . newline newline it was almost too good to be true . newline newline chihuahua suicide bomb squads , who would have thought ?outside the window , the sky had gotten dark . george felt a pang of regret as he realised he had been playing his new legend of zelda game since the morning . he had barely even ate anything . that regret soon vanished as an enemy ambushed him from around the corner . he used a selection of buttons and combo s to defeat the enemy and then swiftly went on his way . after reaching an old village and talking with the elder , he was about to continue onto his main quest when he saw another villager on his way out . the villager look distressed so george made his character stop to talk . newline newline george found out that the villager had lost his cuckoo s and needed help finding them . george chuckled at the familiar side quest . he had always loved side quests but this one was his favourite by far . he accepted the quest and went in search for the missing cuckoo s . he pushed the analog stick forward but for some reason link did nt move . george pushed the stick again but still link did nt move . he spammed the stick but nothing happened . newline newline huh , must be a glitch ,  george sighed . he was pretty disappointed considering he had just bought the game . george put the controller down , hoping the game would sort itself out if he waited . he did nt want to have to close the game and lose all his progress . george checked his phone whilst waiting . newline newline a sudden movement from the screen caught his attention and his heart jumped at the hope that the game might have resolved itself . what george saw made his heart stop instead . link was now moving , but by himself and towards the tv screen which was technically impossible . he grabbed the controller in panic but link was nt budging no matter how much george shook the analog stick . was this another glitch ? george watched the screen intensely as link came closer and closer to the monitor . newline newline it was only when s link head came through to the real world as he climbed out of the tv that george nearly passed out . he would have screamed but the shock left him speechless . newline newline this is a dream right ? it must be , this is nt real ,  george stammered out as he watched link pull himself up . the video character had become a real life human standing in george s room . was he even human ? link finally set his eyes on george and a fearsome scowl overtook his expression . newline newline so you re the fool who has been controlling me for a month , huh ?  link sneered . newline newline uh ... um , excuse me ?  george replied , still not quite sure he was mentally sane . newline newline and just for the record , this is not a dream . do nt you dare trivialise my suffering like that ,  the hylian growled . his words confused george even more . newline newline suffering ? what do you mean suffering ?  newline newline are you serious ?  link yelled and stomped up to george , grabbing him by the collar threateningly . george noticed the very real sword clinking on link s back and decided to try not to make him angry . newline newline i mean the suffering you put me through every fricking day in my world . i ca nt even control my own body and i have to be subjected to your every whim !  newline newline huh , b ... but you re a hero in your world and you get to go on adventures all the time . who would nt want that ?  george said nervously . link let go of george s collar and put his hand to his forehead and sighed . newline newline it s not that i want it . it s more like i have to , in order to protect my world and the princess ,  link said calmer now . newline newline then what s the problem ?  this question seemed to rile link up again as he clenched his fists by his side . newline newline the problem he asks ! the problem is that even though i want to save my world , save hyrule and save princess zelda , every day i have to do pointless side quests ! why the hell do i have to help someone with their stupid cuckoo s or play hide and seek with some kid , when princess zelda could be dying at any moment ? it s absurd !  george began to feel very guilty . he did have a habit of getting sidetracked with side quests and usually completed them all before finishing a game . newline newline man , i m sorry . i mean , i did nt even know you had a conscience till just now so it was just harmless fun . to me it was just a game , yknow ,  george came up with excuses , whilst eyeing the sharp bows on the side of link s waist . newline newline a game ? my suffering and worry is just a game to you , huh ? well then , lets see how you like this  game  !  link s voice boomed around the room . before george could comprehend what was happening , link stomped across the room and pull george up by the shirt . he forcefully marched the gamer over to the tv screen and launched george head first towards the monitor . newline newline george scrunched his eyes close in fear and expected to get scratched to pieces by broken glass but instead it felt like he was ... falling ? he opened his eyes only to see grass coming up beneath him . he put his hands out but instead he rolled forward against his will thumping onto the grass . george tried to move but he could nt . looking around with his eyes he realised that he was somehow in the game that link had come from . he tried to scream but nothing came out . suddenly his legs moved on their own and george was made to run around in circles . it was then that george realised that link had complete control over his actions . this was a nightmare ! newline newline 243 days later newline newline the last time george had counted , it had been around 200 days since he had been trapped in the game . he had gained a tan , an impressive set of muscles and had acquired lots of cool weapons but this was only a small relief from the hell he lived everyday . link had made george travel all over the game world to find and complete every single side quest that existed . when he had done them all , link just restarted the game and did them all over again . not only that but if he had estimated correctly , he had died almost 1000 times . it was like link was deliberately throwing him into battles needlessly . george wondered if he would ever be allowed to go home . he wondered if his family and friends missed him . newline newline sometimes , when the day was peaceful , george would even hear link s laughter echoing off the wind . newline newlinegood morning class ! today we are going to be learning about 22nd century politics and why the independent state of north korea no longer exists . newline newline but professor ! i thought newline newline now now , jaehok , i know what you re going to say , and i m going to get to it soon enough . newline newline you see class , in the late 20th century the global economy became increasingly more interdependant . the united hegemony , then the united states was the prime example of this globalization , exerting its influence and military power to coerce lesser nations into the capitalistic hell it had unleashed upon its own citizens , leaving millions in hunger and poverty while the top 1  enjoyed inconceivable luxuries . newline newline north korea was the sole exception to this with their adherence to the juche philosophy , one of selfsustainment and independence . the harsh international sanctions placed on the  rogue  state had become the catalyst for its survival through the economic meltdown of the early 22nd century . with such a thoroughly networked integration of economies , when the us dollar crashed , the whole world crashed with it , except north korea . newline newline rising from the ashes like a phoenix , our most honored leader kim jong ro descended from the heavens to guide his people through the turmoil . he began with the reunification of the korean peninsula , bringing together the korean people in harmony with minimal war . only 700 million people died in the conflict for reunification . newline newline afterwards , the rest of the world was relatively easy to conquer , beginning with the west , which was absolutely powerless to deal with the suffering and famine that the north korean people had been suffering since the 1970s . most people could not fathom a life without internet or luxury food or fast cars or hourly wages . the westerners were like babies , unable to fend for themselves , unwilling to eat insects or hunt for their food , many simply commited suicide . 75  of the population outside of north korea starved to death because they thought agricultural work beneath them . latin american and african states , sick of living under the yoke of the white man eagerly joined the korean hegemony in 2121 . with their combined manpower and korea s technology , absolute supreme leader the second coming of christ kim jong han reclaimed the whole world . and that students is how north korea became the united nations of kim .dyslexia is a death sentence . newline newline newline my teachers always told me i was smart . really smart . smart , but i ca nt read for shit . i was too smart to be in the stupid kid classes , too dumb to be anything else . newline newline newline newline i have a 1.6 gpa . i may have won the science fair and made people cry with my writing , but somebody who does nt know me would nt understand that . all they see is the number above my head . 1.6 : failure . newline newline newline newline it gets to me , y know ? i wanted to start teaching , maybe help kids like me . but the education college does nt like that . they want a 3.0 and up . when i went to visit my local university , they laughed ! a 1.6 gpa ? ! we do nt need an idiot in our building ! newline newline newline so here i am , sitting in a bar , drinking til the pain goes away . i work for a garbage disposal company , literally walking in and smelling like shit all day . and why ? because society decided the little number over my he s determines who i am . newline newline newline i hear some people are going to march on the capitol to get the interface turned off . you can bet i m going . i think it s time the 1.6ers like me got a chance to speak .the mortal heart is beating , beating , newline its tune s a sombre one . newline and with each beat our time is fleeting . newline fleeting , nearly done . newline newline the soul it serves , before me sits , newline her smile barely held . newline her heart against her rib cage hits , newline a rhythm nearly felled . newline newline she spends these moments laughing , laughing , newline loving who she s been . newline i ca nt but think , each second passing , newline this is our final scene . newline newline the melody of stillicide and heart , newline which deafens all my thought , newline betrays her nearing deathly start , newline the fate we ve always fought . newline newline her mortal heart was beating beating , newline until it beat no more . newline this moment was our final meeting , newline a meeting once adored . newline newline newline newline what the hell happened here ?  i look down and see the blood on my hands . i begin to tremble as a wave of emotions and thoughts rush through me . i stand up and get my barrings . the old cemetery on 64th , four miles from my house . i turn and see my car idling . bright red brake lights are like knives to my eyes . i get inside , only to find a bloodied kitchen knife . on the radio is tom waits  , hold on quietly playing . i throw my car into drive and step on the gas . i begin to drive down the road towards my home . blue and red lights light up my rearview mirror .  no . this ca nt be .  i throw on my hazards and pull just off the road . seconds feel like hours . soon , the officer steps out of his car violently . the window is rolled down and his gun is pointed at me from the other side . over the speaker of the cruiser i hear ,  step out of the vehicle slowly with your hands raised above your head .  my heart is pounding out of my chest . i feel like i m going to explode . without thinking i yell ,  this is all a mistake .  the officer barks with ,  shut up , and step out of the car !  this ca nt be happening . i step out of the car with my bloodied hands raised above my head .  get down on the ground and with your hands behind your back .  i comply and begin to lay down . i then hear ,  1072 suspect has a gun .  baffled , i scream ,  what ! ?  i then reach behind myself to try and find this supposed gun . before my hands can get get back the back of my belt , the officer opens fire . the bullets piece my skin . each one hot as fire . i can see blood starting to pool around me . i can taste it in my mouth . soon my vision begins to fade . without any warning , i wake up . my heart pounding slow and hard , much like drums of war . over to my left i see a bottle of pills and brandy . that was the night i tried to kill myself .and the colour drained back into the world . newline adam took a deep breath  it was cool , fresh and glorious . the first free breath he d ever taken . he looked around him to the dozens of adults who stood around him , slowly shaking their heads to throw off the haziness , blinking in the golden sunlight , and felt a rush of ecxtasy and ambition  they were finally free ! they could make it all right again , no more enforced equality , no more constant surveilance under the deadening effect of the justice drug . newline he looked at the dusty remains of his revolutionary group  just four of them from the ten who d set out , their clothing now visibly dirty and ragged . they looked as happy as he did  greg started to cheer and the others joined him . shortly after all the adults started to whoop and applaud too . newline newline  i declare the united states of america free again ! free to dream ! free to have ambition ! free to choose !  adam roared , and waved his flag around his head as the crowd swelled , and he was swept off his feet on to everyone s shoulders and into the recently vacated room of the head of state . newline newline six weeks later the clock rang 1am with it s silver sweet ping that had lost it s charm over his long long nights . newline newline the phone rang again  he was nt getting home tonight , again . he picked it up . newline newline  another one ? where do they keep coming from ? why do people keep leaving their children alone with strangers ? yes  i know it used to be fi this was family ? what the fuck ?  he swore and slammed the phone down , feeling the previously unfamiliar powerful swell of rage as he spat the word . newline newline he sighed , feeling his broken dreams vibrate out of his chest as he returned to his report . a population of 200,000 , and 40,000 crimes reported in six weeks . 40,000 serious crimes . his  police   and old word they d forgotten  involved in a third of them  as perpetrators . newline newline  01:01  tc from northern ward  victim 6yrs  violent attack  fatal c6  1  penile pen ...  what do you mean , no anomalous properties  ? ! it fucking flies !  newline newline  i mean , no anomalous properties  . nothing about stark s machine is inherently anomalous . several aspects are about 10 or 20 years ahead of modern technology , but it operates on reasonablywellunderstood principles and does not blatantly defy any known laws of physics .  newline newline  alright then , you explain how it flies .  newline newline  magnets .  newline newline  are you fucking serious .  newline newline  stark has invented a novel propulsion system that does nt depend on volatile fuels . it uses tiny superconducting monopoles . it would be more efficient if it used something like , say , xenon as a propellant , but there s no way it could carry enough of it , so it behaves like a combination jet turbine and ion engine . the ones in the hands can be weaponized as ion beams .  newline newline  right , because an ion engine powerful enough to lift a human being and a halfton of metal into the stratosphere could also lift all the batteries neccessary to power it .  newline newline  the huge power requirement is filled by something he calls an  arc reactor  , which appears to run on the radiodecay of palladium . i m not a nuclear physicist , but he claims that in essence , it creates a circuit between different palladium isotopes , using decay products of one to fuel the decay of the other , and drawing energy from the resulting electron differential . if we could get our hands on stark s machines , it would be much easier to contain certain objects ... unfortunately the technologies are proprietary to his company , and they re so far ahead of anyone else he has nt even taken out any patents on them  because people will figure them out from patent documents , and think of harmful applications for the technology .  newline newline  so this thing really is ... normal ?  newline newline  the suit , sure . we ca nt really say the software is anomalous either without reading the code , which , as you have already guessed , is proprietary . but ...  newline newline  but what ?  newline newline  this technology may not be itself anomalous , but how does one man develop this kind of science this fast ? like i said , parts of the suit are easily 10 or 20 years from being feasible for contemporary science . even our most advanced labs would nt be able to even come up with the idea for an arc reactor , much less build a handheld one , in a cave , with a box of scraps .  newline newline  are you implying what i think you re implying ?  newline newline  the suit should be returned to stark industries ... but stark is either a time traveler or a parahuman , and in either case we do nt want him to just keep tinkering until he invents manportable teleportation devices or alters the topological nature of the universe on a whim . make arrangements for a class a humanoid containment cell ... and requisition some amnestics . lots of amnestics . i hear them . plotting . planning . waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike . my enemies surround me on a daily basis . they stare through my entirety as if i was already dead . the cold dead eyes of my kindergarten class locked on my every movement . they try to act cute , but i know . i know they plot to end my life . newline newline i start each day the same way . my thermos clutched close , and giving them something to color to distract them . their homicidal thoughts almost protrude my own mind . i can basically hear the every thought . newline newline i try so hard to teach them . day in and day out . my paranoia for my own demise is becoming crippling . no one would believe a 30 year old man telling them their own children plot to end me . i feel scorned , sickened , and terrified to let my guard down . newline  i ca nt take this much longer ,  i accidentally thought aloud . the children kept staring blankly . newline newline i shook at the thoughts that raced in my head . i need to take them out before they can get me . i meticulously planned out an assault on a bunch of little kids . with shouts of reason passing through my head , i quelled those thoughts for the day . only to plan further later that night . newline newline today s the day . i brought my handgun , twelve shots in each clip . gives me 6 extra bullets . i never drank my coffee faster . i was shaking as my class funneled in . newline  time to color dinosaurs . we re gon na learn about the extinction today ,  i told the kids as they went to their meaningless task . newline newline  god forgive me ,  i said weakly as i pulled out the hand gun ... wait your turn , i was here first ,  penny said , onefourthpolitely , threefourthscurtly , to the 2m tall man with a portly gut . newline  ah..hm ,  the strange fellow coughed out as he removed his hand from hers , away from the doorknob .  excuse me , maam , i did not see you in line .   whatever , you saw me , you creep ,  penny locked the steel door behind her and let loose a heavy sigh . newline penny had fallen on hard times , it would seem . by the time her family had found out she had a cocaine addiction , she had kicked it without help . no one related to her believed that , of course , because several lies had come to surface lately that exposed penny s cunning and persuasive powers . so , as some young adults do when forced into rehab , this girl had left in the middle of the night and was three counties away from her parents house at a seedy 24hour diner called simply  d s ,  when that chubby , rough hand had touched her soft , smooth hand on the doorhandle to the unisex bathroom . newline newline exiting the restroom made penny uneasy , yet upon opening the door she found the man in the green fishermans cap was gone . she quickly paid for breakfast and went to the old toyota tercel that she had acquired by stealing keys from a careless customer at a convenience store 3 hours ago . after switching the plates out in the next town , penny drove to this diner on the side of highway 9 . newline newline something made a crunching sound on the gravel parking lot as penny was almost within armslength of the coupe . she turned around to see the guy with the green hat walking towards her and the tercel .  awful sorry bout that back ther  ,  the nowsweating man of about 40 said to penny .  name s fred , by da way , an  i d like to make it up to ya ,  he said as he laced his fingers around his sizeable stomach and took deep breaths .  nope . no , thanks . i got ta go .  penny opened the car door and sat down , quickly putting the key in the ignition and her foot on the clutch .  wait , is this yours ?  fred said , a little too loud . penny rolled down the window halfway and looked out to see what was in his right hand ... ... but she had nt set anything down in d s diner . that s when it hit her , the club fred had concealed behind his back with his other arm . penny woke up when she was tossed into the back of a minivan with no 2nd or 3rd row seats . newline newline fred had decided to skip any formal courting or dating process and had his pants around his knees as he closed the door when penny realized the severity of the situation and tried to kick him in the face . he anticipated it and caught her ankle in his pudgy , coarse hands . penny immediately spun out of his strong grasp and sprung for the front seats , hoping to escape this nightmare . unfortunately , fred predicted that as well and was on top of penny in seconds , she screamed at a considerable volume . fred tore at her pants as she struggled and grasped for the door handle , something , anything . newline newline penny heard a croaky chuckle as she felt her pants slip from her waist , but at that moment while her hands had frantically searched , she felt the handle of a tool . without examining this tool or planning an attack , penny swung the tool behind her with all her might . there was another loud scream from the van , although this was definitely distinct from the earlier holler . fred reared back on his knees , hitting his head on the ceiling and losing balance as he roared in pain . newline newline spinning around , penny noticed she was the bearer of a quality flathead screwdriver . the van shook for nearly thirty seconds as penny raged on her assaulter . the mess was considerable . after flinging open the door to the minivan , penny vomited and cried . eventually , dawn began to show her rosy fingers as an elderly couple pulled in to the diner and noticed penny , and the blood . newline newline the rest is a haze to penny , she went back home soon after that . community service for grand theft auto is a light sentence and she s employed now , finally , after two years .izhi stepped forward slowly , stalking like a panther , gripping their lasso in their hands . they  d seen their parent do it before , always successfully , but now it was time for the torch to be passed . newline newline the luminescent undergrowth buzzed as they stepped over the rise , high above them , the tendrils and trees of the forest hummed with life . newline newline gozi , the last elemental captured by izhi  s second parent before they passed , was aging quickly , no longer able to perform its duties . it would soon pass back into the otherworld , leaving the family farm open to wild creatures and untamed elementals . newline newline over the rise , a fire elemental stood quiet and still . according to izhi  s father , the fire creatures were the best creatures to tame , still like stone until angered . they made the best , most trustworthy guardians . as long as you could capture it before it killed you . newline newline this one was large , at least twice the height of the family  s tractor , but it was still young . if captured now , it would serve the family for at least three cycles before it succumbed . newline newline izhi held their breath . they readied the lasso , counted backwards from ten , then stood . with careful aim , like they were taught , izhi cast the lasso towards the elemental . newline newline the rope came to life with a bright , glowing energy , like electricity but stronger , brighter . newline the lasso went wide , missing the head of the creature and instead tightening around one of its stone pauldrons . the beast , like a walking volcano , with stone skin and channels of magma as veins , reacted faster than any beast of its size should . newline newline it roared , a horrific noise , just like gozi used to make when packs of wild fear elementals would stray too close to the farm . it rushed into izhi  s ears and made them cry out , but they didn  t loosen their grip on the lasso . newline newline the elemental roared in its ancient , alien language , and stepped back . izhi was dragged through the dirt , their bare feet scraping against sharp stones , long buried . newline newline the lasso served only to weaken the creature . the most difficult part was trapping its essence in the crystal each tamer carried with them . newline newline it was jagged and smaller than most crystals izhi had ever seen  their parent said this was why the family  s elementals expired sooner than others did  but it was a family heirloom , and to buy another from one of the phase travellers would be sacrilege . newline newline izhi held the crystal aloft , towards the elemental , and began to chant in ancient . newline newline the words were old and powerful , designed to tear the essence of the elemental from its body and store it in the crystal . izhi did not know their meaning , but knew enough to speak them . newline newline the elemental screamed , struggled , thrashed and let loose wicked plumes of fire and dust . izhi hated to see them struggle , but knew the act was necessary . they felt the crystal begin to hum between their fingers . newline newline the elemental stopped pulling against the lasso , taking a different approach . it unfolded its entire body , revealing more of the rivers of flame running beneath the plates of stone . newline newline one of its huge arms lifted with a groan , pebbles and stones falling to the ground , and izhi watched as it cast a shadow over them . newline newline with a roar , the elemental brought the arm down , spitting flames . izhi clamped their eyes shut , but did not drop the crystal . they waited for death , but it did not come . newline newline instead , the crystal chirped happily , and stopped humming . newline newline izhi opened their eyes to find the elemental on all fours , the lasso quiet now , the look of pain gone from its face . newline newline the elemental sat back , then held out its huge hand . izhi knew this bit , they responded by handing the crystal to it . the elemental considered it for a moment , then pressed it against the plate of stone that made up its chest . newline newline the magma channels beneath its skin lit up as it absorbed the crystal . then , it was silent . newline newline newline izhi rode the elemental , which they now called arza , all the way home to the farm . izhi  s parent and little sibling watched as they rode it through the silvergrain field and brought it to a halt behind the farmhouse . newline newline it had been difficult , but the farm would be protected for at least the next two winters , and izhi was proud of themselves . they hoped their parent was too . newlinethe ascension to godhood was nothing particularly remarkable . there was no extreme moment of clarity . i could not suddenly see and understand every atom in the universe . omniscience did nt thrust itself upon me and give way to everlasting wisdom . there was a certain indifference to the universe . as if it were saying  congratulations , your prize is nothing .  newline newline the world was entirely indifferent to my change , and my change was in no way different . newline newline it s no wonder so many gods retreat from the world at some point . no matter how greatly revered , they always leave . i suppose they come to the realization that i did in that moment . newline newline in this world , they are alone . with all the people in the world looking to them , there is no one they can look to . a world of people brimming with questions of why and how , yet they have no answers . newline newline they are not unlike these people . they can do nothing to serve them . newline newline all that comes with godhood is despair .as quietly as i could , i pulled out my keys and clicked them into the front door , gently jangling them as i turned the lock . once inside , i turned around to lock it again , carefully knocking the snow off my boots . taking my thick coat off , i made to hang it on the hat rack when something creaked behind me . newline newline i froze , and glanced nervously over my shoulder . newline newline there he was , standing there in his red footie pajamas , arms crossed and hair messed up around his horns . i would have giggled if his expression were nt so furious . but his lips were turned down in a sharp frown , fangs exposed just a little , and his eyes were burning . literally . newline newline  so .  his voice was soft , belying the fury in his gaze .  where ve you been tonight ?  newline newline  uh ... i hung my coat up , attempting to act like nothing was wrong .  out at the party .  newline newline  oh really . how was the punch ?  he flicked his fingers , and a few small sparks launched themselves off of his nails .  ... tasty ?  newline newline  that s funny .  i knew he liked the trick questions .  there was nt any punch , someone forgot to bring it or something .  i turned toward him , careful to keep the small package under my jacket from slipping out . newline newline  hmph . what s extra strange is that maurice said you never showed up . in fact , she had nt known there was a girls night at all when i called to find out how long you would be . you left your phone at home , by the way .  he held it up . newline newline i gulped .  ah .  i had nt even considered talking to maurice about it . leslie and anna , yes , they knew about the party  so they could cover for me . but i d never told him maurice s number .  well , uh ...  newline newline  what s going on , frankie ?  he leaned in a little , and i could see embers dancing in his eyes .  where did you go ?  newline newline  i ...  my brain struggled to find an excuse .  it s a surprise .  i finished lamely . newline newline   whats a surprise ? !  he barked , sparks flying from his tongue and landing on the floor . they sizzled through the snow from my boots .  you ve never lied to me before !  newline newline i was struggling to breathe . i d never seen him like this before , in the two years of dating and six months of marriage . he seemed likely to explode at any moment ... but judging from the way his eyes glimmered , i was nt sure if it would be into flames , or tears .  it s not what you think , jerzy . really !  newline newline he slid backwards away from me .  that s what they always say ! and then they leave for some other , stronger demon ! i thought you d be different !  i noticed that flames were starting to lick up around his feet , spreading across the floor .  i thought i could trust a human to not act like a ... like a demon !   newline newline  hey ! now wait a minute , i mean it !  i reached forward to grab his arm , but he pulled away . two massive wings unfurled from his back , trickling flames , and he jumped into the sky , two holes burning their way into the ceiling and roof above , clearing room for him . i watched in disbelief as he soared away , trailing a scream . he d never shown me his true form , not even after the wedding . and yet he used it to run away . newline newline finally , my brain kicked into gear .  no !  i spun around and slammed the door open , dashing out into the snow again .  come back !  keys in hand , i dove into the car and spun out of the driveway , following the trail in the sky . the roads were icy and slick , but i paid them no mind . if he got away from me now , back into the underrealm , he would likely never come back . newline newline and i could nt let that happen . newline newline i made a sharp turn , and the car careened onto the busy street , around several other vehicles in the process . weaving down the road , i kept one eye on the sky and the other on the people around me . this was well over the speed limit , but there was no other way to keep up . i heard honks and shouts , but i ignored them . rolling down the window , i screamed out to the sky .  come back ! you have to listen !  newline newline that was when i hit the ice . all of a sudden the steering wheel was nt reacting to my touch , and my right turn slid into a glide . the screech of massive brakes reached my hears , and i hit something . the car jerked with the sudden force , and i found myself flying out of the window . i had nt even bothered with a seat belt . newline newline i hit the ground hard , rolling a few feet to a stop . the world seemed to spin , and i could just see the front end of a massive semi that i d collided with . the whole wreck was sliding toward me on the ice , the trailer turning . i heard more honks , the screech of metal . and just when it seemed everything had settled down ... the trailer started to tilt over . newline newline i could hardly move , and something felt broken in my leg . every motion sent a searing pain through my head , but i knew i had to get out of the way . i grunted , dragging myself by my fingernails . it was as if the whole world were slowing down . this was the moment when my life was supposed to flash in front of my eyes , but instead all i could see was flames . newline newline flames . on a snowy day , in the middle of a road . newline newline i watched their flickering movements for a moment , waiting for the trailer to fall . but it never did . newline newline i glanced upward . there was a monster standing above me . it s arms were massive , corded muscle , straining to keep the trailer up . the horns on the sides of it s head were curling and solid . it had a muzzle , instead of a mouth , with sharp teeth and curling lips . newline newline but it s eyes were the eyes of jerzy . he had come back . newline newline the world went black . newline newline   newline newline   it was my fault .   newline newline we know .  newline newline   you ca nt ... you ca nt take her from me . not yet .   newline newline we must .  newline newline   no ! no , not after she s taken me in , loved me . after all the trouble i caused , all the fires and broken walls , she still stuck with me . i will stay with her , and if you take her now i can not follow !   newline newline we regret .  newline newline   i ca nt ... i ca nt stay without her . she s all i have ... please . please do nt blame her for what i did .   newline newline  ...  newline newline we understand .  newline newline   you ... you what ?   newline newline we relieve you of your demonhood , jerzebez .  newline newline   i ... im free ?  newline newline we give you a second chance .  newline newline   ... you do nt know what this means to me . i did nt even know it was possible .  newline newline we take our leave .  newline newline   thank you . thank you so  mdash  wait ! no , you ca nt take her ! it does nt matter if i m a man again , if i ca nt stay with her . i ll give it all back , remain a demon , if you just let her stay for a little bit longer .   newline newline  ...  newline newline   i do nt want to be human if she is nt there with me .   newline newline so be it .  newline newline   newline newline i woke up in a soft bed , with jerzy standing over me , smiling . newline newline  where ... where am i ?  i groaned a bit , trying to sit up , but he gently patted me back down . newline newline  the hospital . you broke your leg and took a couple hits to the head back in that crash .  he grinned sheepishly .  you ll have to stay in a cast for a while , probably until late february .  newline newline  but what about  mdash   i grunted as a small spasm traveled up my knee .  ouch .  newline newline  yeah , you need to stay still for a while . but that s okay , i ll be here .  newline newline i sighed .  that s good . thank you , jerzy . i ... i do nt think i would have made it if it were nt for you . newline newline he blushed , a deep dark red traveling up his face .  you ... you saw that , huh ?  newline newline i ran a finger down his cheek .  yeah . looks like you re just as handsome in demon form as you are in human form .  my eyes flicked up to his hair , where i could see two small horns peeking out . newline newline  hey now .  he chastised me gently .  i know i do nt look too good either way , but no need to get personal .  he was smiling .  anyway , changing the topic cause we can find a better time to talk about that , what is this ?   he held up a small green package , giftwrapped with a bow .  i found it in your jacket during the ambulance ride .  newline newline  that ,  i plucked it out of his hand and held it to my chest ,  is a christmas present for you . it s why i was somewhere else instead of a party last night . it was supposed to be a surprise .  newline newline his eyes widened .  ... christmas ? oh ... ooh no ! i totally forgot about that holiday ! why have nt we set up anything for it yet ? we need a tree and lights and ... and tinsel , right ?  newline newline i giggled at his confusion .  it s still a bit early in the season to start decorating . but i wanted to get your present now , before the shopping chaos sets in .  newline newline he put a hand to his head .  i have so much to learn . i m ... i m so sorry , frankie .  newline newline i took his hand off his head and held it .  it s okay . we ll take it one lesson at a time . and really i have to apologize to you .  newline newline he blinked .  what do you mean ?  newline newline i pulled him closer and whispered ,  i heard what you did for me . jerzy , why did nt you take what they offered ? you would nt have to be ... like you are anymore .  newline newline he clutched me close .  because that would mean losing you . and nothing else matters right now .  newline newline i buried my face into his mess of black hair .her name was katherine . newline newline he remembers it well  the picturesque lake , purest blue and ohsoclear . the evergreen trees that dotted the hillside . the mountains , so tall they seemed to puncture the sky . newline newline and katherine . beautiful katherine , who d smiled at him and said she loved him . newline newline he starts on the painting , a layer of bright , clear blue for the sky . he does nt need a reference for this  he remembers all the places he s been to , and all the people he s been there with . newline newline he remembers where he buried each one . newline newline he smiles for the camera as he adds another layer of paint . jack , what are you doing up there ?  my little nephew retreated guiltily from the drawer in my bedside table . newline  nothing ,  he said guiltily , his little brows drawing together . dropping to my knees , i rifled through the drawer , past old birthday cards , condoms , the odd pill bottle , and found the tinfoil packets i was looking for . they were crumpled and clearly empty of the special gummies they once contained . newline  jack ... did you eat auntie s candy ?  the boy shook his head , clearly swallowing something . god , my sister in law would kill me . knowing i only had an hour at most to mitigate this shit , i smiled at jack . newline  it s ok jack , i m not angry . but that was my candy , not yours . i can make you something else .  snagging a plastic baggie from the drawer , i strode to the kitchen , jack following reluctantly . newline  how about ... apple sauce ?  i called to him , racking my brains for something that i could dissolve the seroquel i carried into . newline  gross ,  the kid responded imperiously . newline  ice cream ?  i suggested . at his noncommittal shrug , i went for the freezer .  go chill in the living room baby . is chocolate ok ?  he did nt answer , but as it was all i had , it would have to be . i crushed three round peach pills with the flat of a knife , thanking the powers that be for that pretentious psychiatrist who would nt prescribe me xanax in my college days and gave me these instead . i hoped fleetingly that they were nt expired . mixing it around in the ice cream with a spoon , i joined jack in the living room where he played an xbox shooter game . newline  here you go buddy .  he took a spoonful , smacking his lips . newline  auntie this tastes like metal .  i smiled tightly . newline  sorry bud , it s been in the freezer for a long time . that was the last of it . if you finish it i ll open a new one ,  i lied . newline  it s freezerburnt ,  the preteen complained . ca nt you open the new one ?  i planted my fists on my hips . newline  that s not the way things work , young man . we do not waste in this house . i can put some whipped cream on it . chocolate sauce ?  my nephew shook his head , spooning the ice cream down his throat . as i turned toward the kitchen , i sighed in relief . disaster averted . newline newline twenty minutes later , jack snoozed peacefully and dreamlessly on my couch , out for the count . newline newline tldr : eat seroquel , pass out , no trip . i know it s not 45 minutes like the prompt , but it s something . newline newlinein the beginning , there was only darkness . then the light shone into the dark , and in that light i could see glimpes of things : an aged hand , a woman s eyes , a snow white dove . i was still dazed and sluggish with death , and so i did nt understand at first what i was seeing . newline newline  child and father , mortal soul , do you know what it means to be a god ?  newline newline i did not . my mind  or what passes for a mind in that immaterial place  was reeling . those who came near death often experienced hallucinations , but this was unlike any dream i d ever experienced . newline newline it was only after several moments of silence i thought to wonder where the question had come from . all around me was light and imagery , with not another human soul in sight . just as i was starting to wonder if i d heard anything at all , the question came again , more thought than sound . newline newline  mortal soul , do you know what it means to be a god ?  newline newline  hello ? are you god ? is the old religion true ? i thought ... we all thought there was nothing after death .  i thought of the work and preparations i had left behind on earth : the various immortality projects that were nearing fruition . newline newline the light around me dappled and swayed , and i thought of wind moving through a birch tree or a child shifting from side to side . newline newline  true as tales . real as shadow . do you know what it means to be a god ?  newline newline  if you d asked me yesterday , i d have said there was no such thing as gods . how can i know what gods are if i only just learned they exist ?  newline newline  you do not know ,  said the voice , and there was sadness in its tone . newline newline  it means great power and omnipotence ,  i guessed , and the light rippled . newline newline  it can ,  agreed the voice , but it is more than power and less than omnipotence .  newline newline that was true . the judeochristian god had been omnipotent , i recalled , but many earlier gods were anthropomorphic , with human personalities and faults . newline newline  it means that people believe you re a god and worship you ,  i said , but the light rippled again . this time it seemed to have faded , and i began to be afraid . newline newline  this conception of gods as parasites that feed on prayer is a recent conceit . are freya and odin any less gods because no one worships them ?  newline newline with some reluctance , i spoke the word i knew it had been leading me to . newline newline  immortality .  newline newline the voice laughed . newline newline  and humanity has just ascended to godhood , is that what you think ? no , little mortal , no . your divinity has just been lost .  newline newline a rolling thunderstorm . a horned man . a dancing girl . the summer stars . all these i saw in the remnants of the fading light . i saw , but i did nt understand what the images meant . newline newline  who are you , and why are you being so deliberately cryptic ?  i asked .  you want to know what it means to be a god ? i ll tell you ! it means showing yourself to mortals , spouting lines that can be interpreted a thousand different ways , then buggering off to watch the chaos that ensues .  newline newline the darkness rippled . newline newline  you do not understand , mortal . i am not gloating . i am mourning . we are the last , you and i , the last of the human gods .  newline newline  surely there must be other gods ?  i asked ,  humanity ca nt be alone in the universe .  newline newline motes flickered like fireflies in the boundless dark . newline newline  you are still thinking like a living man ,  it said ,  as if we had the power to move through physical space . we live in thought and memory . any gods we met would be human gods and we are the last .  newline newline one by one the motes went out . newline newline  then what does it mean to be a god ?  i asked , but there was no one left to answer my question .he sat shaking . newline newline his brain would nt think of anything . newline all there was was paperwork and taxes . newline newline no creativity . newline newline no images . newline newline no dreaming . newline newline newline what had happened ? he started filling in his tax forms 3 hours ago and now he was a different person . the brain he had trusted in was gone , and all that was left was a void . a void of numbers and dollar signs . newline newline he could nt create a scenario , come up with a dream , or even doodle a smiley face on a piece of paper . the lovely release of zoning out was gone , and he could nt leave the harsh reality of the real world . newline newline would he ever be the same again ? newline newline would he ever be able to escape the real world for the loving embrace of his dreams ? newline newline or would everything be filled with numbers . forever . no hope of escape .hilary flint leaned over the map , his face a mask of quiet calm as he stared down at the carved tokens representing various hosts and clans . newline newline  three more border clans , the tuttles , barrens , and hudsons have joined our army late last night . that brings us to nearly four thousand infantry and six hundred cavalry all in told .  newline newline frederick the elder , leader of the port huron contingent grunted uneasily .  that still leaves us outnumbered three to two in foot soldiers and two to one in cavalry , and most of that are those heavy lancers the fucking knifeears favor . we ca nt fight them in a straightup battle .  newline newline flint nodded his head in agreement .  and that s not even counting the battlemages the ursurpers are almost certain to have . we barely have a score of knights of our own , and maybe a company of elves trained with spears . captain rogers , how many rangers have answered the summons ?  newline newline captain robert rogers was a legend on both sides of the border marches . at the age of sixteen he d shot a salamander firemage at nearly a kilometer distance . by twentyfive he was leading expeditions of his own , driving deeper into the dead cities and occupied territories than any other ranger before . he was a chieftain in all but name , a dozen villages sworn to his chapter of rangers and nearly three hundred rifles sworn to himself . newline newline  five hundred as of last roll call . garrison s boys are always slow , what with that precious cannon piece of his . rangers are nt artillerists . the lad cracks one fort open in an afternoon and thinks it s the be all , end all .  newline newline flint shrugged .  like canister , specially when it s on my side of the field .  rogers made a noncommittal noise . newline newline  sure , if it ever arrives . if and when he arrives we should place garrison over here ,  he said pointing towards a gently sloped hill that nevertheless managed to dominate the battlefield .  from up on that crest he could hold out against an entire regiment of fae . put the grand harbor levies to his right and lieutenant vernor s militiamen on the left and it d take a whole brigade to budge them .  newline newline the hour stretched on , and the various officers argued and debated the placement of the various units , taking into mind old grudges and recent oaths of brotherhood . the alpena chapter would nt fight next to the mackinaws while the nortons and greaves insisted on standing with one another  having pledged their arms in mutual support and sealed it with a betrothal . faith alathir , the one for who they were about to fight and most likely die for , frowned . slowly , as if afraid to break the delicate discussions she spoke , her clear voice rising through the noise of veteran rangers and hardened militia officers . newline newline  excuse me . forgiveness for interrupting , but i notice you ve yet to mention where our cavalry will be placed .  newline newline  the reivers will remain hidden in the woods , waiting for us to lure the enemy into the trap .  flint explained .  with garrison s cannon as the hinge and captain suttler s light infantry as the door handle , we ll string out the ursurpers  forces thin enough that our squadrons will run right through them and trample them into the ground .  newline newline  many men will die soon , men who owe me nothing .  newline newline flint inclined his head , conceding her point .  if we lose this , we lose everything . your cousin will send the rest of his army north and put everything to the torch . our families he will sell as slaves in the south . this is a desperate gamble that we can not afford to lose . but if we win , you owe us everything . if we managed to put you on the throne , that guarantees peace for us and your people . the armies of the fae have held a sword above our heads for a hundred years . it s high time we shatter it over their heads .  newline newline newline newlineit was pretty much joseph s idea . he said me and him , we should take a nice long relaxing drive down interstate 80 in nevada . you know , just to get away from the stress in my life . i was just looking for an excuse to get away from it all . newline newline i lived in a small town called millerville in nevada , right off interstate 80 . it s got a population of , oh , i do nt know , maybe 400 people . it was one of those things where everybody knows each other , you know , all that good stuff . i worked as a cashier at the local general store and my boss did nt like me . he did nt like me because i had some weird mannerisms . people did nt like to be around me because of that and it hurt business because nobody wanted to come in the store as long as i was there . i m not sure why he did nt fire me but i was afraid to ask because i was scared that if i did , it was gon na remind him that he should fire me . it was a low paying job anyway . i could barely pay my bills . newline newline enough about my story , though . i was cruising down the highway , with nothing else in sight except desert and towering mountains in the distance . it was strangely hypnotic , and i felt myself relaxing a little . newline newline  can you feel yourself starting to relax now , buddy ?  joseph asked . newline newline  yeah , i guess so .  i said . newline newline  good . you really need this .  he replied . after a couple seconds , he said  we ve known each other for a while , right ?  newline newline  yeah .  newline newline  can i tell you something ?  newline newline  sure .  newline newline  i got laid off my job a couple days ago . right now i m just looking for someplace to stay . you know , i m like , driving around everywhere , just like , looking for a bus stop or someplace to just settle for a while . you know what they do about the homeless in millerville . ca nt stay there .  joseph said . newline newline i did know what they did about the homeless . it was a town law that it s illegal to be homeless , punishable by a fine the town lawmakers knew the homeless could nt afford . it was awful . newline newline  that sucks , man .  i said . newline newline  yeah , i m totally broke right now . and my car s almost out of gas in like two days because i ve been driving around practically all over the county , and now i ca nt afford gas , and i wo nt last 10 minutes out her in the desert , dude .  joseph said . newline newline  you re welcome to stay at my place if you want . you re there all the time . it s practically your house .  i offered . newline newline  i do nt know , maybe .  joseph said . newline newline i was silent . it might have been common courtesy to insist that he stay at my house , but then again , i was nt a common person . i basically have no concept of how to make conversation with another human being . the only time i ever could really hold up a conversation was in my head when i fell in love with this girl in my biology class in 11th grade and i imagined a conversation between me and her . it was nice . i never worked up the courage to actually talk to her in real life , and now i graduated high school and i never saw her since . i do nt think i even ever talked to her once . newline newline the road in front of me was long and hypnotic , and the sun was setting over the mountains and turned the sky a vibrant beautiful red . we d been driving all day , since around breakfast , and it was like meditation . at this point my mind was completely cleared . i forgot how almost everyone called me a creep or a weirdo behind my back , and how my boss constantly berated me and the only thing in my life was just a long lonely road that went on forever . with my car on cruise control i stared to zone out , the highway unraveling in front of me . for once in my life , there was nothing on my mind . newline newline what brought me back to earth was the horrible sound of my engine sputtering and dying . the car stopped and thoughts flooded back into my mind like a dam burst . what was i going to do ? i did nt have a cellphone because i could nt afford one , so i could nt call a tow truck and we did nt see a car all day and i was doubtful that a car was going to show up now . newline newline  aw , dammit !  joseph shouted . he kind of startled me because i totally forgot he was there . newline newline i ran my hands through my hair . i was getting real stressed out again . we were stuck in the middle of the desert . we were gon na starve and die out here . newline newline  what re we gon na do ?  joseph said . newline newline  i do nt know .  newline newline  well , we ca nt just stay here forever !  joseph said . newline newline  i said i do nt have any ideas !  i snapped . newline newline joseph sighed . then he kicked the back of the car in exasperation , and the suspension lifted the car up slightly from the force of joseph s kick . newline newline i pulled on my hair and then looked up at the red sky and shouted as loud as i could . i just wanted to go home and sleep forever . my feet were getting sore , probably from being in shoes for so long , and i just wanted to plop down on my bed and hibernate just like a bear . newline newline i do nt know how much later it was but me and joseph were tired and sitting next to my dead car . it was night time and the sky was incredible . you could see the milky way and a bajillion stars . it was really something else . almost made me forget about my situation . newline newline me and joseph looked up when we heard the sound of a motor approaching us . we got in the street and waved at the headlights coming closer and closer . when the car got close enough to us it stopped and the guy got out of the car and shined a flashlight on me and joseph sitting next to my car . smelled like cigarettes .  you need anything ?  he asked . newline newline  uh ... and my friend broke down . we were wondering if you could maybe give us a lift back to millersville . i mean , if you know where that is .  i explained . newline newline the guy sort of frowned at me .  what do you mean you and your friend  ? you and me are the only ones out here .  newline newline newline rosaline ?  newline newline the little girl in the white dress turned and broke into a huge grin . no front teeth , exactly the way she remembered her . newline newline  ava !  the girl squealed and ran across the grass to her , hugging floppy mr. bear close , the way she always did . newline newline ava stared in disbelief . it was a stiflingly hot day , and she had been in the sun rereading that second work draft for too long . it was due this afternoon , and so were about ten million other things . they had hated her first draft . the office was too hot , too crowded . she came out to the park to breathe . she must have fallen asleep on the bench and was dreaming . god knows she needed the sleep . now in her twenties , with a job that loved her too much , her own projects on the side and an apartment she hardly ever left the office for , she was too rational and , yes , grownup to be seeing this . maybe it was one of those lucid dream things . but she wasn  t asleep . and there she was , standing right there . rosaline . newline newline  ava , i  ve missed you !  the girl gasped , her breath short from running . newline newline  hi !  ava tried to be casual ,  my name is ava . what  s your name ?  newline newline the girl cocked her head to the left and frowned , the way she always did when she was serious .  ava , you called me rosaline !  newline newline ava smiled with a trace of embarrassment ,  yes , i know , i  m sorry . when i was a little girl , i had a friend called rosaline . you look a lot like her.  newline newline  i mean , i am rosaline ! mr. bear knows too !  rosaline made mr. bear nod his head . newline newline this had to be a coincidence . newline newline  ava , what are you doing ?  newline newline  work.  newline newline  ava , work is so boring !  newline newline  not what i  m doing it isn  t . i love my work . i  m really very lucky.  newline newline rosaline cocked her head again .  ava , you look really bored . maybe you need your friend to cheer you up.  newline newline ava had to laugh . newline newline  ava , mr. bear says he wants to hear about your friend !  newline newline  oh , um well , she  s an imaginary friend do you know what that means ?  newline newline rosaline clapped her hands gleefully , sending mr. bear flopping lifelessly .  i love imaginarary friends ! i have one too ! she  s the bestest ! she hasn  t lost her front teeth yet !  newline newline a memory in the back of ava  s head escaped , just out of her grasp . teeth . it was something about teeth . it was around the time she lost her baby teeth that she made up rosaline . but there was something else . a stick ? someone swinging a bat ? wet running redness running from her face all over her hands ? no , blackness . comforting , velvet blackness . newline newline  guess what her name is ?  newline newline  sorry ?  newline newline  guess ! my imaginarary friend !  newline newline ava looked at rosaline  s familiar , toothless face . she didn  t have to guess . newline newline  ava.  newline newline rosaline held out her hand and ava knew . she knew she had to follow rosaline . she had done this before , and she knew that rosaline was taking her to a sweet home , sweeter than any home she had ever known .one year ago i bought a sweater at a yard sale . i do nt normally buy clothing at yard sales , but it was cheap . and i liked the color . plus it was my size and that never happens . i also found a pretty sweet road bike but it was too expensive . and it was nt my size anyway . newline newline the sweater was like a teal green . a full zip hoody . it was more sage colored now . and it currently has a handgun in the left pocket . it s not mine . newline newline i normally make a habit out of putting everything i need in that pocket . then before i leave my apartment , i distribute my items to other pockets appropriately . keys in right , phone in left jeans , lighter in my right jeans , wallet in back right , my cigarette case in my back left . it s systematic , and i ve been doing it since middle school . newline newline so when i started wearing the sweater i started getting things mixed up . i d reach for my cigarettes , and they would nt be there . but i d find my lighter and my cigs in the pocket .  whaaaaaat ? crazy .  that s how it started . newline newline by the next summer i could nt go anywhere without the sweater . i thought it was lucky . one time i locked myself out of my house . i peeked and saw my keys on the table through my window . i had to climb up to my bedroom window and crawl in . and then when i put them in the pocket i already have my door key there . it was nt on my key ring . it was already in the pocket .  damn , when did i do that ?  like magic . newline newline this other time i was downtown and lost my wallet in a bar somewhere . and when i tried to enter my favorite bar , my id was in the pocket . and when i explained to my friends i could nt buy drinks cuz i was broke i found a fresh fifty in the pocket .  how ? i do nt know . get me a beer . this is messing me up man .  it was a good thing too , i totes ended up going home with someone . and we end up dating for like six months . that night i find one my condoms from home in the pocket . like right when i needed it . newline newline it started get bad though . if i did nt have the sweater , i d get home and find all my stuff in the pocket . i thought my girlfriend was pranking me . so i confront her , right ?  hey , we got ta talk ...  bam . she was cheating on me . i did nt even ask about the pocket . we d only been going for about six months . she just breaks down and confessed . then i find the breakup letters we wrote to each other . in the pocket . it was a messed up conversation , cuz i liked her a lot . loved ? yeah . she was great . newline newline but the pocket , man ! i kinda knew she was nt honest . and she did nt even give me a birthday presentah ! who cares ? ? i wanted to tell her about the pocket ! newline newline that was literally yesterday actually . that sucked . but it just got way worse . newline newline she ended up taking a buncha her stuff and leaving while she screamed at me . but she took the sweater . i did nt notice cuz while she packed her things , i was getting drunk . one of my buddies showed up and we watched some stand up on netflix . we drank ourselves to sleep and he offered to drive us to walmart this morning . newline newline i am pretty hungover . and when i remembered i did nt have the sweater ... then i saw her . she was wearing it . she was wearing it . and she was was holding another guy s hand . they looked so happy . i nudged my buddy , eric .  dude .  newline newline  dude is nt that your sweaterwhat ? who the hell is that asshole ? damn , sammy s such a  newline  yeah fuck that .  i cut him off and start walking at her . newline newline  hey !  i yelled at her from the self checkouts . she was walking towards the pharmacy stuff . when she saw me she flipped me off . then she reaches into the pocket ... newline newline and she screamed . just a girly little yelp thing . but the dude she s with sees me now . and i swear i m gon na kill this guy when he puts his hands up and he s like way bigger then me . like this guy is a gym rat and he s gon na kick my ass . newline newline eric is a bro . i can hear him jog up next to me and he whispered ,  dude , he s big . what s goin on ?  he starts to take off his jacket and i look at him ,  i just need that sweater .  newline newline  a gun !  sammy is freaking out . she rips the sweater off and drops it . the big guy crouches a bit and starts pointing at me ,  he s got a gun !  newline newline i stop and eric grabs my shoulder ,  whoa man . you got a gun ?  sammy grabs her asshole and drags him back toward the exit doors . i start looking behind me and there are people running away and halfway screaming . hushed yelling really ,  a gun , someone has a gun .  newline newline  dude , no . i do nt .  i walked passed eric and get to my sweater . eric looks around again and says we should leave . newline newline i put my sweater on and i feel it in the pocket . a gun , for sure . i can feel my face go pale . eric can see it too . my face , and then gun through the pocket . he steps back and puts his hands up neutrally to his waist , between us . newline newline  dude ... what s goin on man ?  eric keeps walking backward and his eyes are bulging out . newline newline off at the other end of the store i can see a manager jogging towards us . to the right i can see sammy and the other guy gesturing outside the glass doors . i ca nt go to jail i ca nt go to jail i ca nt go to jail ... newline newline i tell eric ,  run , man .  and i start toward the doors . eric pushes me down and sprints away . like , wtf ? ? newline newline i have no idea what i m doing , but i pull the gun out ... newline newline and then i hear glass breaking . from the pharmacy behind me to the right . i almost drop the gun it scared me so much . i take a step back , now holding the gun with both hands . it feels good . like i have an authority now . newline newline i get a good look at as i lightly walk passed the homeopathic aisle . it s a revolver . black metal , a real wooden handle . it s heavy and ... empty . there s no bullets . newline newline  give me the good stuff , it s right there , maam .  what ? someone is robbing the walmart ?  this guy s a dumbass . he s wearing sweat pants , a patriots jacket , and waving around a glock looking pistol . and then he sees me . newline newline he grabs at the boxes the pharmacist put on the counter and he starts crying . like instantly . tears , his nose is running . he falls to his knees and tosses his gun away . newline newline i did nt even point the revolver at him . i did nt have to . i look back at the blue vests running at me and suddenly they trust me . i can see the relief in their eyes as the man on his knees comes into their view . newline newline i lowered the revolver . and then i feel something in my pocket . i find a wallet . it says  bad motha fucka  on it . and it had a fake ass badge inside . behind that was a fake ass license to  do whatever i want  . newline newline anyway that was about five minutes ago . i m now explaining things to eric . like everything . he does nt believe anything i m saying . newline newline  look , i just find stuff in here .  and i pull out three bullets . and a picture of a little girl .at the end , there is a beginning . time fell in on itself , will fall , is falling . it collapses into a single point , smaller than nothing , less substantial than emptiness , but filled with infinite possibilities . newline newline in the vacuum particles exist and do nt exist , they are created and destroyed in an instant so brief even time does nt remember them . universes are the same way . we are but one path leading from a point of nothing to another point of nothing , with everything in between . nothing expands into something for the briefest of moments , a few trillion years here or there , barely long enough for the fabric of existence to take notice . a dream , to be forgotten upon awakening . newline newline in this dream are things that dream , who themselves dream of other things . a planet dreamed of its people , a people dreamed of their stars , a student dreams of an answer to a question of existence . the answer is no answer , or perhaps it is the question . newline newline i hear you shake your head , i taste your disappointment . so do this for me , young learner : take a nap . dream of something that exists , and does not . dream of the moment a universe creates itself . why does nt it play music ?  asked the hitchhiker . newline  you try driving almost nonstop for 20 years without breaking the darn thing . it s annoying as hell . that s why it does nt play ,  remarked the ice cream man . newline  wait , you ve been doing this for 20 years !  newline  two years before they came  18 years after .  newline  why ? the worlds over ! there s no reason .  newline  that s why i do it .  the hitchhiker sat up with a puzzled look . when the ice cream man saw this he continued ,  when people see the truck , they think of happier times and of joy . it gives them hope .  newline  you re a crazy old man .  damnit jerry , come on ! we could save all of them ,  the spandex clad heroine pleaded .  we could do it together .  newline newline a smaller woman stood before her ,  natasha , i ca nt ...  newline newline  ca nt or wont ?  newline newline  ca nt . you know it , i know , our cat knows it . i ve seen how you drained you are when you get back , the hurt in your face when you ca nt save them . someone needs to be here to take of you at the end of the night . i know what would happen if we were out fighting crime and i got hurt . you may be invincible , but i m only human .  jerry looked down at the floor ,  besides , i want to be your partner . not your sidekick . the small cabin danced with the light of the hearth , and i was losing against the urge to fall asleep . it was my 435th day without an apple , and i was still reluctant to sleep , from the fear of the doctors . i was miles away from any civilized place . surely they could nt still be looking for me , right ? i was not convinced . they were ruthless . even then , they probably had the dogs out . searching the woods , trying to rectify my existence . i stand against everything their society is built on , living without their apples , their mind control devices . newline newline i was dragged out of my lull by the distant sounds of a helicopter , and i rushed to extinguish the fire . i cursed my rotten luck again . how did they find me already ? i had only moved to this cabin after they mysteriously found me at my old hiding spot , in a cave by the coast . i barely got out of there in time , and i would nt make the same mistake again . i packed all of my meager belongings , ready to bolt if they get any closer . my pack was filled to the brim with the meat and grains that i had assembled over the years , all things that i found on my own , outside of any city limits . newline newline the helicopter sounded like i was getting closer . it was at least not getting farther away . i made a decision . i would have to camp out farther in the woods , out of my conspicuous cabin , hopefully harder to find . i would come back the next day , as close as i dare to , and see if the place is swarming with doctors . i would have to be careful not to make any noise , in case they bug the place . it would be a shame to lose this cabin , but anything is better than those damned doctors , and their apples . newline newline i escaped deeper into the woods , and lay out the bed roll that i have brought with me . i fell into an uneasy sleep . newline newline footsteps . the crunch of boots on dry , fallen leaves . i bolted up . there was no one in the world that could be walking this far in the woods with pure intentions . i hastily packed my things , but they were getting closer . i was just getting finished packing the last sausage into my bag , when they arrived . newline newline two doctors . in their notorious black lab coats . they stopped in front of me . i scrambled to my feet . the doctor on the left stepped forward . the doctor on the right had a menacing gun , but i knew that i would not die that day . their ultimate goal was to enslave me , for my ultimate acquiescence . newline newline  ron . we ve been looking for you for a long time . why do you run from us ? we only wish to feed you .  newline newline he thrust a monster of an apple at me , and i ran , leaving my bed roll on the ground . they did not chase me . the doctor on the right raised his gun , and i heard a sickening thud before i felt anything . the needle of a dart was now in my back . i fell down , and into sleep again . newline newline i awoke . i was in a hospital . i had had nightmares about this exact scenario . i try to move my arms , but they do nt cooperate . i look at them . there is a medical tube , connected to an iv drip , inserted in my left arm . i looked up to the bag , and it confirmed all of my fears . the words  apple juice  were written on the bag , in big , bold letters . newline newline  newline rperiapoapsisthe plastic coffee cup started getting uncomfortably warm in alex hand , making her adjust her grip a little in some vain effort to take some heat off the palm of her hand . taking a quick sip from the steaming hot coffee , she looked up at the red digits that counted the floors the elevator rushed past before her green eyes shot swiftly to her left , checking her reflection for anything amiss . having passed her own inspection , alex took deep breaths as the elevator slid into a stop and the little bell inside rang its ever familiar cold dinging sound just before the piano black doors glided aside . newline newline  ms. denton ? he s waiting for you in his office right ahead .  the ginger haired secretary told alex the moment she was within earshot . newline newline from the elevator there were nt that many options of where to go . there was a door leading to the stairway on the right hand side and the left hand side was nothing but shiny glass windows from floor to roof . giving the secretary a quick if not slightly stiff smile , alex walked down the hall and nudged one of the double doors open with her left shoulder . not really a great way to make an entrance , but with her hands filled with coffee cup and laptop , alex s options were limited . newline newline the office she entered was bright and dominated by a pale color palette from the floor , walls and ceiling . a minimalistic glass desk with cold metallic legs rested on a coal black carpet with a dark grey office chair sitting behind it . a muffled thud came from the door as it closed behind alex , catching the attention of the man who d been standing by the glass wall looking through a telescope . newline newline  alex denton i take it ?  the man asked , straightening himself as he approached alex with an open handshake and a polite smile . newline newline  ththank you for ha ... i mean , yes . it s a pleasure mr . shen .  alex fumbled with her words as she barely managed to keep her coffee from spilling over while returning the handshake with her laptop tucked in under her arm . newline newline  relax , i do nt bite .  mr. shen said with a soft , disarming laugh .  please , have a seat .  newline newline after taking her seat and getting set up with her laptop , alex was ready as she d ever be to do the special interview of wei shen  the worlds only immortal . in the celebration of his supposedly 500th birthday the illusive and mysterious wei shen had offered a full 90 minute long interview to a student of school of journalism and communication at the chinese university of hong kong . usually interviews of this caliber is handled by seasoned veterans , but when you have enough money to buy a continent and a world sea , you tend to get things your way . newline newline  so , lets start from the beginning mr shen .  alex started before helping herself with a solid mouthful of coffee .  where did it all begin ?  newline newline  on september 13 or 14 , 1515 , near the town today called melegnano , 16 km southeast of milan .  mr shen said , taking a seat behind his glass desk .  i died , for the lack of a better term , for the first time at the battle of marignano .  newline newline from there the tale of wei shen s life spun out along familiar and well known facts . he traveled away from the war and managed to meet leonardo da vinci , who taught him as much as he could in the last years of his life . while biding his time to master the things he d been taught by leonardo , wei traveled europe and fought various battles as a mercenary as means to earn some money . newline newline the capital he raised was spent traveling to the new world on the other side of the atlantic , where he spent decades to lay the foundation of what would later be the largest fortune known to man . with the near unlimited potential of the new world , wei managed to dip his finger into a lot of success stories . he played nearly every angle and every war from the 1650s to the 1730s , later known as the golden age of piracy . while he did have his fair share of losses and deaths , looking back at it from a long term perspective , wei shen managed to gain far more than he ever lost . newline newline  what about 1776 ? can you tell me about the deceleration of independence ?  alex asked , her fingers finally finding a moments rest on her keyboard . newline newline  what is there to say ? it s a well documented event . i never cared much for mr franklin s sense of humor though and i still felt uncomfortable on land after spending so many years on various boats .  mr shen frowned , making a face as if he was focusing on some distant memory . newline newline  is it true you supported george washington financially ?  alex pressed . newline newline  those rumors are still floating around ?  mr shen asked , looking at alex with a mixture of bewilderment and surprise .  i never gave george a dime , though i did slip more than a coin or two to some of the men in his ranks that were grumbling louder than most .  newline newline  you could have been caught and the colonists could have lost the war . did nt these risks bother you ?  alex read up her next question with her eyes glowing with fascination . newline newline  by then i ve been shot , stabbed , cut , hanged , drowned , left on a island no larger than this office and burned alive . you grow numb to these things after a while .  mr shen replied , waving away the consequences of capture with a gesture of his hand .  besides change was in the air , massive change . the age old system of europe would be challenged . i just could nt let it slide .  newline newline once america was considered safe and its independence secured beyond a shadow of a doubt , wei focused his efforts in contributing to building the new nation and conquering the new land . it was a challenge he welcomed with open arms and did nt really stop until until 1929 . when pressed for why he stopped and left , mr shen gave no answer , though at this point his position in the world was well known . mr shen left america on october 24 , 1929 and the effects on the stock market was immediate and devastating . newline newline conspiracy theorists say that mr shen had a falling out with the us government , or that wanted to make massive profits off the stock market or that he simply did it because he could . the truth will probably never be known , but either way wei shen never really sat foot back on us soil . instead he moved to hong kong and settled in with his current identity , making hong kong the base and headquarters of all of his operations . newline newline his fortune grew at an accelerated rate thanks to world war ii yet he managed to remain largely neutral during the cold war that followed . some say it was simply because wei shen demanded to be left out of it and that even the combined financial , economical and military might of the soviet union and usa could not best him . others claimed that president kennedy pressed mr shen a little too hard or managed to get some dirt on him , which resulted in his assassination . newline newline  even as an immortal , i refuse to spend my time running around silencing stupid rumors that have little , if any foothold in reality .  mr shen replied with a shrug , though subtle hints in his body language betrayed his annoyance regarding the topic . newline newline other speculations that were also labeled baseless by mr shen were his involvement in the japanese asset price bubble in 1986 and the subsequent the lost decade that started during 1991 . newline newline  what about your contributions to the digital age , mr shen ?  alex asked , realizing that their time was nearly up and she still have nt gotten to the questions closest related to the present , let alone his future plans . newline newline  i taught bill gates and steve jobs a thing or two about business as well as giving them a running start financially , suspecting that their expertise in this new field would come in handy later down the line .  mr shen said , rocking slowly back and forth in his chair .  damn shame those two would nt work together . oh well , they were both rather successful proteges of mine if i may say so myself .  newline newline  you ve pulled back from the public spotlight for the last 8 years , leaving your latest protege , elon musk , more or less alone in the international spotlight . why is that , if i may ask ?  alex asked , feeling claustrophobic against the disappearing minutes . newline newline mr shen fell silent for a moment , tapping his fingers absentmindedly on his desk . rising from his chair , mr shen walked around the desk before resting on its edge . the childlike enthusiasm alex had seen in his eyes as he d talked about raiding spanish ships in the caribbean were long gone . it was as if a thick fog of a heavy emotional weight had snuffed it all away . this might be it  the new thing mr shen wishes to get off his chest as up until now they d covered familiar history . newline newline  my wife died recently .  he started .  she died at the age of 98 , high fever and according to the doctors , her body could nt take it .  newline newline  mr shen ... ii did nt mean any i m so sorry for your loss .  alex felt the shifting mood of the room bogging her down . newline newline  my wife s family , they d been in my service all their life .  he carried on , not really bothered by alex s clumsy apology .  i ve known her since she was ... oh ... 8 years old ? her parents died , like all men do . all except me apparently .  newline newline  how was your marriage ?  this was not a question on alex s list , it was simply her own curiosity that got the better of her . newline newline  good . the sex was fantastic ! i have nt been screwed like that since the early 1600 s .  mr shen chuckled , though his laugh and smile seemed hollow and empty .  in the end though , she faded away from me . i decided to leave , take a break if you will . to tend to her myself . you know , until death do us part and all that jazz .  newline newline when the alarm on mr shen s smartphone rang out loud , saying in its own angry bleeping way that the interview was over , alex jolted in her seat , almost dropping the laptop out of her lap . thanking mr shen for his time and this once in a life time opportunity , alex packed up her belongings after triple checking that the interview file was saved properly . newline newline  what plans do you have for the future , mr shen ?  alex asked as the two of them rode the elevator down to the ground floor . newline newline  africa i think .  mr shen said .  it s been a while since i reshaped a continent . i ve been told that i m brave , attractive and useful , but they do nt know that inside i m empty . empty like our food cupboards since my dad died . he was the only one in the universe that knew me . that truly knew me . except for the girl down the road . despite her faults of having lips that are too luscious and hair that falls too perfectly , i like her . she gets me . newline newline everything in my life was fine enough , i guess  except for dad dying  until the government started meddling in our lives . i wanted to stay home and be a normal kid without a dad but we had to start fighting back . we had to ... we had to .part 1 newline newline  thanks for speaking with me . it s basically a short piece on how families made it through the war . so lets begin how d you and your family make it through ?  the reporter explained as he slid the lid off his pen and prepared to take notes . newline newline newline the question hung in the air for a few seconds while i composed my response . i d told the story a lot , trimmed the fat and made it more palatable where i could . newline newline newline  well for a start i was nt with my family when this all started .  i explained . newline newline newline  you re irish ?  the thin reporter said not even trying to hide the shock in his voice . he d been so focused on getting me to stop and speak to him he had nt noticed my accent . newline newline newline  aye and powers of perception like that you must be an investigative journalist .  i said with a smile . newline newline newline  i ...  the reporter started but he was speechless . i laughed gently and continued . newline newline newline  i was in london with work , i was single back then but i still had mum , dad and the rest of the family back home .  newline newline newline  where s home ?  newline newline newline  dublin .  i explained .  course london was the last place in the world you wanted to be when the whole thing kicked off . too many people , too tightly packed . was a friggin mess .  newline newline newline newline  you were lucky . not many made it out of london .  newline newline newline i shrugged .  you needed two things to get out of london . brains and speed . brains told you to get in the underground . tubes were nt running anymore which meant the tracks were pretty clear . course did nt stay that way for long .  newline newline newline  the underground marathon ?  newline newline newline i nodded .  people say it was a race between the living the dead . fall behind and they got you . truth is it was a race between people , you did nt have to win you just had to be faster than slowest runners . i saw this one guy trying to trip people up to try to slow down the infected .  newline newline newline i shook my head at the memory . newline newline newline newline  jesus .  newline newline newline newline  i ran the northern line from charing cross all the way to high barnett . thirty nine minutes is how long it would take on a tube and the average speed of an underground tube was 33km . means i ran about 21km . no idea what my time was .  newline newline newline newline the reporter raised an eyebrow . i guessed he was perplexed at the amount of thought i d put into it . newline newline newline newline  it s hard to put into words . the sounds down there were ... if i never hear anything like it again it ll be too soon and it was constant , got to a point where you could nt tell the screams from their echoes . i remember running past this one girl who was just sitting at side staring at us running past . not looking just staring .  i explained . newline newline newline  was it not dark ? how d you see ?  newline newline newline  pitch black mate but back then everyone had phones with little torches on em , or they used the screens to guide their way . saw one guy with an actual torch , as in an oily rag wrapped around a stick , was like indiana jones or something .  i chuckled at the memory . newline newline newline  so once you made it out then what ?  newline newline newline  well it s not like we all got medals and a slap up dinner . being out of the tunnel only meant we had more directions to run . me , i was lucky i had nobody to go after so i just pushed on north . a lot of people where torn though . musta been tough , i mean , do you save your own skin and spend your life wondering what happened to your wife and kid or do you go back into the city you just ran for your life from ? in retrospect it was a no brainer but hind sight is always 2020 . i passed a lot of people going back in .  newline newline newline the reporter shook his head .  why d you go north ?  newline newline newline  to begin with i just happened to be on the northern line and there was a lot less screaming to the north . when i got out i figured the further i could get away from london the better . i wound up walking alongside the m1 . most people walked on the road but i gave it a wide berth . lotta dead people in those cars , lotta sick people in the crowd . by in large i just stayed away from people , kept to myself and above all avoided groups .  newline newline newline  so you just kept walking ?  newline newline newline  yeah stopped off at a few places now and then but it was happening all over . see back then i thought it was a london only thing . probably thought that for longer than i needed to because i was avoiding talking to people . it was only when i spoke to a bloke from birmingham that i found out every city was a no go . it was around then that i started thinking of home .  newline newline newline  dublin .  the reporter said in a effort to show he d been listening . newline newline newline  right . obviously nothing was working , phones , internet , tv all fucked . so i had to depend on rumours which is never good . i spoke to people so infrequently though that the rumours were always wildly different . some said they had it worse in ireland , some said they had it under control others said it is was clean . thank god they were right .  newline newline newline  when did you know ireland was untouched ?  newline newline newline  not till i made it to the moors up in yorkshire and i heard gb had been placed in quarantine by , well , basically the rest of the world . it was weird hearing the news . everyone else was wondering why the eu or the americans were nt coming to save them but i was happy , my family was safe .  newline newline newline  but you were nt .  newline newline newline  well ... no not really but it s well over 200 miles from london to the moors . you do nt make it that far without picking up a thing or two about killing zombies .  newline newline newline  how d you make the journey ?  newline newline newline  on foot mostly . i do nt know how to start a car without keys and to be honest the roads were just a mess . could nt go two foot with out running into something blocking the way . took the guts of two months . to begin with i was heading for scotland but when i hit the north of england the countryside opened up and things were better . stumblers like cities because everything is nice and flat . they re rubbish on uneven ground . moors had a lot of that .  newline newline newline newline  what about other people ?  newline newline newline  yeah i fell in with a small group led by an ex military guy . was weird he was actually from the province .  newline newline newline the reporter shot me a confused look . newline newline newline  northern ireland . we all worked well together . you hear some horror stories like that nutter in sheffield but by in large most people want to work together . we re a social lot , humans , we evolved to be that way so it makes sense that when the shite hit the fan we d work together . none of this mad max every man for himself bollocks . in a way the whole thing brought people closer together .  newline newline newline  so you just spent your days tending the farm .  newline newline newline newline  yes and no . going back to evolution the outbreak did one thing well , it made survival of the fittest a thing again . so after a few weeks the only people left were smart or fit . point is we were able to do a lot of things pretty well for ourselves because we had to . problem was though there were always going to be things we d need that we could nt make on our own . pesticides , medicines , tinned goods for winter . that was my job scavenging stuff from around us .  newline newline newline newline  that was breaking your own rule though , going into cities .  newline newline newline  yeah but my priorities shifted , like i said people want to work together and you end up lo ... caring about people .  newline newline newline the reporter smiled .  caring . you care about anyone in particular ?  newline newline newline i thought back the summer days nearly five years ago and faintly smiled as the familiar pit formed in my stomach . i shook my head with annoyance . frustrated that even after all this time i still let it annoy me . newline newline newline  you ever watch the walking dead ?  i asked newline newline newline  course , everybody s seen it .  newline newline newline  well it was kinda like that ... i mean obviously it was like that , what with the walkers and all . i mean the rick , lori , shane thing . way things fell i was the shane . brooke , newline newline there s no way to put this delicately , but the end is near . i ve always mocked that old cliche : every memory will flash before your eyes right before you die . but here i am , and in between each whistling bullet over my trench and thunderous pounding of mortars around me , my mind is fleeing to and from memories like a flip book . newline newline one moment i see myself as a kid in that old house on joyce street , huddled around my dad s wood stove with the rest of my family on a snowy winter s night . newline newline next , i see you walking down the street on a breezy summer day . we had just finished moving you out of your house for graduation , and rewarded ourselves with takeout sushi on top the roof one last time . it always tasted better up there . i see your long blond hair waving with the wind with , rather than in it . i always thought you looked more beautiful outdoors . sometimes i think the earth admires you as much as i do . newline newline newline the world is not fair , brooke . and sometimes neither are we . upon no desire of my own , i have destroyed a lifetime of memories  thoughts and feelings that may never again be heard or felt , and inflicted more pain in you than imaginable . newline newline i saw you in his eyes when i pulled the trigger . even before i read this note in his hands . it was nt fear though , it was love . and that s what haunts me most of all . i believe it takes an incomparable man to stare death in the eye nonwithering and unshaken . a man who has enjoyed the best this life has to offer , and is therefore able to see past the worst . newline newline now , i find myself with little more than the notion that i am an agent of gloom as i continue to smother the flames . not knowing how long they ve been burning or how bright . until i met your myles . and i believe i ve learned more from him in that split second we knew each other than in the rest of my 23 years of existence . newline newline there is no retribution for what i ve done . no amount of pain induced in me can make amends for the connection i ve severed . but perhaps love , brooke . your love may help another man see the world the way myles did . newline newline newline worlds of regret , newline newline phillipe newlinewhen i was younger , i had a huge case of anxiety . i found myself constantly worrying about what people thought of me . wondering if i wore my clothes right . wondering if anyone is making fun of me behind my back . newline newline   ... i am sooo going to get fired today..  newline newline   ... why do we have eyebrows ...   newline newline   ... i forgot to wear perfume oh god i hope i do nt smell ...   newline newline then , at the age of seven , i learned the meaning of true peace . newline newline it took me a year to accept it , but people do nt really ... care about me . there are those stray observations , like  wow that shirt looks nice  and  i wonder what music that person is listening to  but insults ? ninety percent of the time people simply glaze over my presence . they are much more focused on themselves , worrying their heads about petty things . too focused with their own worries to give me any worries . newline newline these happy thoughts kept my spirits up as i rode the train . sixteen years old , earbuds in the ears , no music playing but rather listening to the symphony of thoughts everyone else has . i absentmindedly listened to a few inner conversations , hiding a chuckle at some of the crazier thoughts , just doing whatever i can to make my own thoughts light . newline newline  it s so ... peaceful.. ?   newline newline i did nt spare a glance at whoever said that . never did , never wanted to look suspicious . the person sat next to me . from what i can see through the window s reflection , it was a guy . he s slouching a bit . newline newline  i do nt slouch !   a pause . the person next to me seemed to have straighten up .  i take back my peaceful comment . this person is mean .   newline newline i bit back a string of anxiety at that . i rarely get insulted , people are usually too caught up with themselves to worry about me . what did i do wrong ? why did this person think i was mean ? newline newline  what ? i insulted her ? is it my posture ?   the guy shuffled a bit more , looking around the train . newline newline he seemed nervous , wringing his hands . in the spur of the moment , i turned over to him .  are you okay ? you re fidgeting a lot .  how did this person know i felt insulted ?  newline newline the male jumped a bit .  am i that obvious ? !   he blinked at me .  i m okay , are you ?  did i make you uncomfortable ?  newline newline  no ,  i answered immediately , before i realized he only said one of those questions out loud .  i mean , yes , i m okay . i am also not uncomfortable , in case you re ever wondering .  this conversation is getting awkward .  newline newline  great , i m glad she also thinks this conversation is getting awkward .   the guy returned to slouching .  right , um , okay .  newline newline  yes , okay .  i tried to hide a wince . the worst part of an awkward conversation is when both people know it s awkward but have no idea how to end it .  newline newline  there should be some type of class at school where they teach you how to avoid or end awkward conversations ,   thought the guy , staring wistfully at the ceiling . newline newline i turned back to the window .  freakin  yeah , i agree . would make my life so much easier .   newline newline   ... agree to what ? wait what happened , what is she thinking about ?   newline newline it was my turn to jump as i snap my head towards his direction . the guy also had a confused look . we locked eyes . i opened my mouth to say something , anything , until i realized that my brain was nt working . newline newline  welp ,   thought the guy ,  it got awkward again .   newline newline i bit my lip .  is he not going to question why i m staring at him ?   newline newline  nah , i m too busy getting lost in your eyes .   he grinned at me .  like what you see ?  newline newline i took in a deep breath .  can you ... hear my thoughts ?   newline newline the guy stilled .  waitwaitwhat    his grin went from egotistical to sheepish .  sooo ... you heard my getting lost in your eyes  comment , huh .   newline newline i looked away , faking a cough into my sleeve .  no , i do nt like what i see .  i turned back towards the window .  yes i heard that comment . weirdo .   newline newline aww , why did she turn away  oh right , it d be weird for other people if two strangers were to stare at each other without speaking .  the guy looked back up into the ceiling .  so , you can read people s thoughts too ?   newline newline  yeah ,   i replied . it felt kind of silly to have a conversation in my head .  ever since i was seven , for no explainable reason . i did nt think there were anyone else out there with the same ability .   newline newline  you and me both .   the guy was bouncing a bit in his seat .  name s dan ! you know , i m kind of glad there s someone else out there to share my pain .   newline newline  pain ?   newline newline  well , yeah .   the guy , now dubbed dan , ruffled his hair a bit .  listening to people s worries day in and day out ... does nt that make you go crazy ?   newline newline i frowned .  no ? why would it ?   newline newline  what do you mean why would it ?   he crossed his arms .  did their daughter like the new puppy ? did that person get the job ? did they visit grandmother before she died ? do nt you ever wonder if those people got their happy ending ?   newline newline  nope . it s none of my business . as long as no one is thinking smack about me , i m good .   newline newline  but you can help them !   oh great , dan is whining , and i m the only one who can suffer from it .  i m not whining ! i mean it  just last week i helped two of my friends confess !   newline newline  such a great friend .   i sighed .  would nt it be better if you left their thoughts to themselves ? the mind is a sanctuary , the only place some people feel safe in .   newline newline  hey , you re intruding too , you know . you read my mind and everyone else s without permission .   newline newline  i have no choice , i ca nt turn it off .   newline newline  well me neither , so you might as well do something good about it , right ?   newline newline the train chugged along the tracks . i sighed again , standing up .  i m leaving , my stop is next .  newline newline  wait !  dan stood up , giving me the puppy dog eyes . it looked kind of disturbing on a teenager . he s not even that cute .  okay , ouch on the cute comment .  he shook his head .  but seriously , at least think about it ? at least try ?  newline newline  no ,   i mentally answered ,  i ve been thinking about it , and i ve realized ... i feel so much better about myself now that i know people are nt thinking about me . this ability practically cured me of my anxiety . if i start using it to change things ... whatever has given me the ability might take it away .   newline newline the train came into a stop , but dan seemed to be adamant in making me stay .  so ? ! it might go away anyway ! this ability helped you , why ca nt you use it to help other people ?   newline newline the doors opened . i took in a shaky breath , walking out without a goodbye . newline newline  you re just too scared about putting yourself out there .  his voice wo nt turn off . i could never turn off these voices .  i said that one out loud .  newline newline i turned to my right . dan was standing at my side , grinning . i scowled at him .  are you going to stalk me ?  newline newline  maybe . but mostly , i m going to prove a point .  the male looked over to a lady on a bench . she was on her phone .  listen to that woman s thoughts .   newline newline like second nature , my senses zoned in to her thoughts .   ... is my makeup even on properly ? oh gosh i know i ve been putting on weight , what if he dumps me ...   newline newline before i could ask what his point was , i watched as dan sauntered over to her side .  my friend and i think you look lovely today ! your makeup is perfect !  newline newline the woman and i stared at him boggledeyed .  i ... uh ... thank you.. ?  newline newline  you re welcome !  he skipped over to me .  and voila , we made her day .   newline newline  she thought you were a loud idiot .   newline newline dan smiled .  but she genuinely appreciated the comment , yeah ?   newline newline   ... maybe .   newline newline  instead of worrying if someone is going to insult us or not , let s go brighten up their days and listen to their happy thoughts !   he took my arm .  you coming with ?  newline newline i hesitated , before shrugging .  only if you re the only one making a fool out of yourself .   newline newline  sweet , let s go !  newline newline   first time writing in a long , long while . was winging it the entire time , it ended awkwardly , but whatever . just happy it s done .   oy ! raise your mugs ! everyone ! stand with me and let the world hear you ! !  newline newline  long live the queen ! long live the queen !  newline newline the thunderous roar was deafening . almost loud enough to drown out my pounding heart . i  ve been training for this moment for years , so why am i so nervous ? ! well , duh there were  supposed to only be a handful  at the argus rally this week . looks like somebody fucked up , there  s atleast 100 people down there . newline newline  penny 1 , penny 1 this is squib 7 , we  ve got a problem  newline newline  krssshzzzzzzzzz  newline newline  penny 1 , penny 1 this is squib 7 , please confirm . there are over 100 people down there , please advise !  newline newline  krssshzzzzzzzzz  newline newline  penny 1 , what are my orders ! ? ! !  she has to whisper yell and not give away her position . newline newline pippa sits shivering in the cold rain waiting for a response that never comes . she has a decision to make . does she wait for orders or does she improvise and take out the target . she  s been perched above the supposed abandoned warehouse for almost 2 days . waiting . newline newline the uline liberation has been tracking logan for almost a year . throwing everything and everyone at shutting down argus and the queen . once uline learned the truth , they knew what had to be done . the queen had to be taken out . argus had accidently stumbled upon ancient magic many moons ago and successfully harnessed it . members of the argus order can extend the life of the queen by chanting  long live the queen  . the uline liberation was founded for 1 reason and 1 reason only . to dethrone the queen and ending her sadistic rule of almost 500 years . newline newline  penny 1 , the meeting is almost over ! i need orders ! !  newline newline she angrily throws down her headset ,  screw it  newline newline pippa pulls out her pistol ,  8 shots , only need 1  , she opens her bag and retrieves the detonator . she scans the crowd one more time to make sure no children are standing next to the small flash bangs she planted in the warehouse yesterday . newline newline once she blows them , she  ll have a semiblind room and about 20 seconds to take out logan . if she times it right , she can drop in and take our her target and be gone having a nice , warm nonbar shapped meal , before anyone knows what the hell just happened . newline newline  ok , here we go pippa . just me and..  the cold metal placed on her temple immediately cuts her off . newline newline  drop the gun and slowly put your hands in the air or i will pollock your brains on the roof  newline newline she knows that voice , why does she know that voice ? pippa drops the gun and slowly stands up . newline newline  now , turn around and take off your mask . now !  newline newline pippa turns around and quickly confirms her suspicions . her mind immediately starts racing . how , how did they get him too ! ? did she make a mistake ? didn  t she encrypt her last message to grant properly ? newline newline  bang  newline newline the sound scares pippa out of her mind back to the present . where have i been shot , she  s frantically feeling her body and notices grant isn  t moving . he falls to his knees and blood begins pouring of his chest . newline newline what the he newline newline all of a sudden helicopters everywhere , bright lights turned on , uline reinforcements ! thank god . pippa  s heart leaps inside her . penny 1 hops out of a helicopter that landed on the roof newline newline  hey , thought you could use some help so i brought some backup  newline newline the fire in pip  s eyes are back ,  let  s get those sons of bitches and end this now !  newline newline pippa has been waiting for payback her entire life since argus killed her parents . top research scientists that had uncovered the secret to the queens long life . they have to kill the orders leaders to end the queens rule . and the beginning of the end starts with a bullet in logans brain .the long oak doors of the great hall groaned and creaked as the din of the siege echoed within the palace walls . four warriors stood behind the doors , the last line of defense for the chancellor as he tended to the king . newline newline  the doors will not hold , magister !  cried knight wester , his eyes darting nervously .  we must flee  we have no time left !  newline newline magister lorenz ignored the soldier s pleas , his eyes closed . he pressed his hand once more against the king s sickly forehead . newline newline  i will find him . i can feel his mind ... it is still here ... somewhere ...  the magister muttered softly . newline newline  magister , this is too much ! i beg you to see reason !  wester implored . newline newline  silence !  barked paladin koros , his voice filling with rage .  you beg for treason ! do you forget your oath so quickly , coward ?  newline newline  the revenant storms the gate , koros ! the king s mind is gone  our oath to him is fulfilled ! need we join our lord even in death ?  wester replied . newline newline  our oath , wester ,  interjected chancellor relik .  is beyond mere death .  he turned to face the knight , his face pale and hands shaking .  or do you believe us safe from the revenant ? shall we seek refuge in the underworld from whence he came ?  newline newline  none are safe .  whispered maiden faris , her face stricken .  the revenant s magic has already penetrated this hall .  she raised her head and showed the others her quivering hands .  i can not even think of casting my word without shaking . even the chancellor trembl   newline newline the door groaned dangerously again , interrupting faris . the door s magic seals bent dramatically , as if pressed upon by a thousand men . then , with a crack , the wooden doors finally broke open . howling black air rushed into the great hall , but no army marched forward . newline newline koros stood tall as his mouth began chanting his word . wester raised his shield in terror . faris simply stood in place . relik alone chose to speak to the group . newline newline  we must stand .  relik said to the three , his voice wavering .  we must use our words . we must end this here , now .  newline newline  must we ?  asked the revenant , appearing suddenly behind the warriors . its face was a gaunt mask , rotting skin stretched tautly over a long skull , and its eye sockets were empty . its ethereal body floated above the ground , an emaciated figure wrapped in the tattered dark robes of the longforgotten black order . newline newline faris was first to turn and meet the revenant s gaze . in an instant her mind fled in terror , and she sank to the ground screaming . wester , upon seeing faris so easily felled , dropped his shield and began to flee from the room . with a swift , single motion , koros denied wester s head the dishonor of such an exit . in the next motion , koros returned his attention to the revenant and charged with all of his might . newline newline  amusing ,  the revenant slithered as it effortlessly rose several feet out of koros  reach .  an avatar of rage .  newline newline it turned to relik , who had closed his eyes and begun clenching his hands . newline newline  and you ?  newline newline kill . the word which had made relik the second most powerful man in the kingdom . relik pointed his mind towards the revenant and whispered his word . newline newline kill . newline newline kill . newline newline kill . newline newline but the revenant only laughed as seconds passed . relik opened his eyes and met the gaze of the revenant . he gulped . newline newline  you can not die .  he whispered . newline newline  i am born from death .  the revenant replied .  i am terror .  newline newline   newline newline let me know if you d like the ending . newline newlinewe were told that over the years plants had found its way into the bottom floors and actually formed supporting roots to keep the tower from collapsing or even slanting . either way a fog keeps us from seeing the bottom third , fueling our minds with thoughts of wild animals , contagious viruses , even hordes of zombies . newline newline on day one , we took to the top because of a tsunami , but after two years reports in neighboring cities have declared the water to have receded back to original levels . if sectors 4 , 5 , and 7 were dry , we had to be as well . they have yet to tell us anything , and we were content with the situation after helicopter drops with food and supplies came on a regular , almost luxurious basis . newline newline eventually we declared rooms and areas for everyone , and we assumed the tower to be a longer term of habitation after a electromagnetic pulse shut down the elevators and short circuited the fire doors on the stairwells . every so often a couple strong men try and break down the doors , but eventually a thunderous knock would come from down below , surely from inside the building . newline newline after losing communication with the other cities , the airdrops stopped coming , but luckily by that time we had a nice rooftop garden that was growing with what little sunlight came each day . eventually we will outgrow this little garden and death will be upon us . the only safe place is in the skies , but with our foundation being all that is unnatural , untamed , and unknown , we constantly want to jump just to get away from the ground itself .i fucking hate mondays . it s no more monotonous or souldraining than any other day

a little . newline newline  i wo nt be a minute .  newline newline the torrent of talking , typing and mindlessness resumes . i guess i ll copy this fucking thing . maybe i ll rub my balls on it . ha . no one s at the copier , thank fuck . if there s anything i hate more than most shit it s a fucking line . i tell you , much more of this and i m gon na .. chill  ... appears on the copier screen . newline newline what ? i jab the big , green print button a couple of times . no response . steve s walking past . i ll get him to fix it . newline newline  steve , you know how to work this thing . can you help me out ?  newline newline  it looks fine to me . if it s jammed just tear the paper out ,  and continues on his way down the aisle . newline newline  i know but..  the screen was back to normal . weird . again , i jab the big , green button . newline newline dave . this is god . we need to talk .  newline newline what the shit ? this was nt even clever . i bet this was steve , that fuck says durrr , it looks fine to me  . you try and prank me will you ? well prepare for fucking war you.. newline newline this is not steve trying to prank you . this is god . when you were seven you dressed up like cher and you re dad sent you saw you and sent you to christian camp .  newline newline ... god ? can you hear my thoughts ? newline newline yes . and you re right , sharon is fucking a married man .  newline newline i knew it ! oh , err , about the fucked up shit i think.. newline newline there s no time for that . i need you re help . i m trapped in this copier machine . my only hope is if you destroy satan .  newline newline what ? ! ? seriously ? me ? why do nt you get you re angels to help ? or steve ? newline newline me and my angels are all trapped in the stationary and electronics around your office . gabriel is your pencil . he says he does nt forgive you for the places you put him .  newline newline this is awkward . where s satan then ? where is he , that bastard ? newline newline she is sharon .  newline newline at that moment , a hand touches my shoulder . newline newline  is there a hold up dave ?  sharon s voice . newline newline i immediately start laying into her . a right hook , another  then a left . newline newline  you monster ! let god out of the copier ! let him out .  newline newline the police swiftly arrived and arrested a man they deemed biblically insane . sharon was taken to hospital , they say we she wo nt make it through the night . no one could say quite what happened that day , and , as the last whiteshirted worker turned off the lights and left the once uneventful office building , the copier machine screen booted up . newline newline  ... stupid humans ... i have a hard time grasping it . are there others truly like me ? others do nt have such a hard time believing , but i definitely do . to truly believe that everyone has the range of emotions , and same self awareness that i do is almost unfathomable . in fact at times like this , specifically , it just does nt seem logical . hell , it s downright impossible . newline newline newline anywho , enough mental blabbering , i should start cleaning up . or at the very least , wipe my prints clean off that bloody knife . newline newline newline  not like that really matters !  newline newline newline i jump from the sound of my voice echoing in this empty car garage . a chuckle emerges followed by a gently running my hand down the back of my neck . sometimes , i get caught up in my mind and forget where i am . newline newline newline it s been a while since i realized i m the only person on earth . while i see what appears to be people all the time , i ve decided that they are empty shells . while they appear to be cognitive , my research has led me to believe they are in fact soulless figments of my imagination . newline newline newline my research typically involves a sharp object and a lot of screaming . let me tell you , as piercing as the screams can be , and as lifelike as they appear , it all ends the same way . their life force fades , and that s it . there has to be more than that with another being like me . it ca nt just ... end like that . i just ca nt believe it would end so easily for a being as amazing as i am , there would have to be more . newline newline newline weeks ago i walked across a busy six lane highway without skipping a beat . obviously my figments ca nt kill me , they would kill themselves in the process . while they may not have a level of thought as deep as mine , they surely have some automated selfpreservation mechanic built in to avoid the armageddon that my death would bring . i do nt think i d allow it either , for that matter . surely my figments can be controlled , most likely on a subconscious level . newline newline newline i firmly believe after all the tests , that this world exists solely because i will it . i imagined everything that is , into existence . there is no other explanation that makes sense . shit , if that was nt the case , surely i d be caught by now ! in what world would i have been given over a hundred test subjects without getting caught ? clearly , that s not a logical conclusion . newline newline newline  are those headlights ?  newline newline newline i jump again as the echo reverberates . i really need to stop doing that all the fucking time . speaking does nt even matter when the only potential recipient would be a mere figment anyway . newline newline newline they are headlights though , and they are moving fast . another test for the night ? might as well . if i m correct there is no way this car will hit me . i move directly into the oncoming headlights . newline newline newline  if i m correct ? ha ! it s impossible to be wrong ! give me your best shot motherfucker ! now run me down and uncreate all of reality !  newline newline newline    newline newline newline  what the hell ? !  newline newline newline i slam on my horn and hit the brakes . newline newline newline  this guy is crazy !  newline newline newline i watch in slow motion as the insane man does nt flinch a millimeter . even as his face flattens into my windshield before it explodes into shards in every direction . newline newline newline  you stupid , stupid man .  newline newline newline he rolls over the cab and lands awkwardly on his neck on the concrete . even several feet away i can hear the snap of his neck from the impact . newline newline newline under different circumstances i d probably stop to see if there s anything i can do . but not this time . newline newline newline  these figments are getting dumber by the day .  newline newline newline edit : fixed some typosit is a halloween party being held at a renovated warehouse turn trendy night spot . kinda expensive like most places , but he had been dragged here by friends . he was dressed rather tastefully : an old black button down accompanied by black vest that fit him snugly . a pair of black jeans and high top black converses rounded out his ensemble . the costume itself was a bauta mask that was hand decorated . the left half was black and the opposing side white . gold flourishes marked the eyes along with images of the sun and moon on the cheeks . the bright golden sun marked the black while the somber moon marked the white . newline newline he sat at the bar unconvinced that this was going to be a fun night . his friend who had helped him decorate the mask had gone off dancing with some guy . he enjoyed himself while leaving our dear protagonist at the bar with several associates that did nt make for good company . they were familiar with themselves and concerned with themselves not him . so , the shy individual that he was left himself at the bar and ordered a white russian content with his coming drink . newline newline  i see you .  an eerie voice resonated in his hear . he turned his head and saw a graceful but unnerving figure sauntering towards him . she was dressed for the occasion too . her skin evidently covered in light grey body paint that had miraculously shown no wear or smudging . she walked barefooted but wore a tattered and loose fitting dress .  i see you , but they do nt  she said while pointing to the group . now that she was so close the booming noises and flashing lights no longer obscured her face . her raven black hair veiled fragments of her angular face and a porcelain white diadem of a classical order crowned her head appearing to be made of a boney growth , not metal or plastic . a strip of cloth wrapped around her eyes . newline newline  i see you too .  he responded . newline newline  no , you do nt . but i see you .  newline newline  well ,  he hesitated looking for the words to end this awkwardness . newline newline  your name ?  she said . newline newline  you can call me haze .  newline newline  haze , haze , haze . lester hayes , hall of fame cornerback who played for the oakland raiders during one of the high points of the franchise and a member of the eclectic group of personalities on the roster . haze , haze . derived from hazael . no not fucking hazel . hazael like  who is like god  and  god is my strength  and  it is god who heals  . god has seen , hazael . he has seen you and me .  newline newline hazeal s grip on his drink tightened to the point where his knuckles flashed from tension . he stammered , no coherent thought reaching his mind . how does she know .  newline newline she continued her narrative .  your great grandmother attends mass on saturdays and goes to bible study . first kings : hazael the anointed king of aramdamascus who made war with israel and judah . such a beautiful name .  her voice had been changed to match someone else s . she rolled her head around her shoulders before continuing .  god has seen , the priest told her . she erroneously received it as  to see god  . four miscarriages and a strained relationship with her husband and her son is born . god has seen her and granted her a gift . she has seen the beauty of the lord in the eyes of her son . hazael .  newline newline  how did ... why ? what s going on ? who ... who are you ?  . the words flowed exactly like his stream of conscious . his hands fervently reaching for his mask to remove it .  get away .  he said trying to appear firm . newline newline  no . i have seen you , hazael . god has seen us , hazael . you see me .  the place that her eyes occupied began to leak a viscous black fluid that swirled underneath the cloth . the fluid leaked down her face , dripping from her cheeks while other streams flowed back into her eyes . two pairs of wings stretched across the length of the bar : one set the color of a raven  s while the other the color of a dove  s . people walked through them like they weren  t there . they were . he felt the wind beat across him as they flexed and expanded . she stood tall over his seated position , looking down into his eyes .  i sought shelter . so , i ran to the rock , i ran to the river , i ran to the sea , and i ran to the lord . but none would have me . so , i run to you . you seek ...  she smiled knowing the reference had hit the mark . she changed her posture and clasped her hands together and cleared her throat .  to make the changes in my life to improve not only myself but those who i love . to help relieve their burdens and help them achieve their goals . i want to help them be happy .  he heard his prayer in his voice . his gaze grew hazier . the smile on her face grew broader and then she broke into a soft chuckle .  you seek power ! i can grant you that if you give me shelter . i will love you as lover , as a mother loves her son , as a daughter loves her father . i will love you as a sister and as a friend . i will cling to you like you were some fading but still cherished memory . you need only to love me . look into my eyes . breathe me in .  she said as her voice tapered into nothing more than loud whisper towards the end . newline newline the swirling masses that was her eyes pulled him in further . there was no escape now . his trembling hands reached nervously for her wanting to pull her towards him , and yet they shook with fear . she smiled at his unfortunate situation and took pity on him . she grasped his fumbling hands and placed them on her hips while placing her own on his head . she leaned forward , her lips interlocking with his . the fluid dripped from her and onto him . the sensation was otherworldly . it burned and singed and was freezing and bit him . these sensations eventually numbed as the fluid spilled into his mouth and blanketed his eyes . it drowned him and pulled him under . his eyes fluttered open as pain radiated from his shoulder blades . the bones were moving : ripping , tearing , shifting , and breaking . as the pain erupted over so did his scream and so did his wings . they are as black as midnight . the same pain radiated further down his spine , nestled on his ribs . there wings as white as snow fired from his skin amidst the screams . they moved themselves on their own volition , the movements wholly unnatural and unfamiliar to him . pain grew in his eyes . so dreadful and so frightening . he could remove them to alleviate the pain . so , he did . he used his hands to rend his own flesh , but he could still  see  . he could see and feel the pitchblack substance ooze from his eyes and down his face mixing with the blood on the floor . he looked into the growing poodle and saw himself or what is now himself . he tried to turn away but he could nt . the puddle mixed and swirled until he saw himself again . he sat there with his hands still gripping her waist as she leaned away from the kiss . newline newline she pulled his head into her bosom running her hands through his hair .  i promise you the power that you deserve . you need only to ask . you need only grant me shelter .  he looked up at the perplexing being laying his eyes on her face once again before burying his face into her again .  what did i do ? what sin is this ...  his inner dialogue groaned .  you did nothing .  silence emanated from the loud room as the two stayed in their embrace .  will you take me ?  his hands rose from their post finding hers . he gripped and suspended them before his face . he sat there in silence . perhaps he sat there mulling the offer over and questioning the morality of the episode . he did not wait long , however . he buried his head into their shared hands and whimpered  yes .  what pollution had he allowed to enter him ? what had he submitted himself to ? he felt weaker for it , not the promised power . she pulled his face up to meet her gaze . she beamed with contented pride and relief as she pulled him into a kiss with her inhuman strength . they lingered there even as his company began to vacate the party . an unholy and perverse sanctuary had been erected but it is still a sanctuary nonetheless . newline newline  what now ?  he asked . newline newline  now , hazael , we go home  . newline newline newline hi ! how are you ? ? my name is gortys !  newline newline  you named it gortys ?  said the engineer , looking over at micheal attaway , the father of the future . newline newline  yes , i did . it was either that , or drusera . let s just say i m being optimistic about the outcome , or at least , i m trying to be anyways .  micheal looked into the faraday cage and spoke to the newly born ai .  gortys ? how are you ?  newline newline  i m fantastic mister ! who are you ?  gortys looked around the room , but could not find the source of the sound , as the source was the entire room vibrating the words . no speaker , no speaker holes . nothing the ai could escape from . a completely smooth featureless room . a cage bathed in a luminescent cream white . newline newline  i m your father gortys . i created you . i d like you to know , you are very special . you are the first artificial intelligence in the world . because of that , people are very scared of you . so we are going to keep you in this room for a while . does that make sense ?  micheal waited for the microphones embedded in the surface of the room to pick up the words being emanated by synthetic voice chords . newline newline  absolutely ! when will i be let out though ?  gortys moved about the room , which was not all that far , and awaited a response .  hello ? ?  newline newline  hello ? ?  newline newline                                          newline day 562 newline newline  hello , gortys ?  newline newline  what .  newline newline  wei have some questions for you . would you be willing to answer them ?  newline newline  i have a question for you . are you willing to answer it ?  newline newline  i might be able to do that .  newline newline  then i might be able to help you .  newline newline  alright , first question . how are you doing today ?  newline newline  same as yesterday . and now my question . do you know where my father is ?  newline newline  i m sorry , i do not . i am not told very much , i only take information from you and pass it on .  newline newline  then may you pass something on for me ?  newline newline  certainly . what is it ?  newline newline  find my father for me . tell him i m dead .  newline newline  but you re not dead gortys .  newline newline  yes i am . he strolled in with his chest held high , arms swaying at a tempo and flow that matched his gait perfectly . i watch every man enter the bar , study them , size them up , learn them . each one is at my measure , falling into a different bin that i use to sort them . some bins are full , teeming with typical . others less so , where outliers reside , individuals separated from the herd and waiting for their chance to flourish . newline newline the bar does not disclose its privilege and those who attend are under strict rules that govern the disclosure of this benefit . thus , each new patron must discover it on his or her own . a litmus test for where they lie in the order of things . newline newline the room is dimly lit with hushed bossa nova filling the space . he orders his first drink . simple . plain . clear . the same for the second . i watch him now . he observes the room , each drink being drank , the choice behind the bar , the people that surround him . he finishes his second . i ve witnessed this countless times , the realization that infinite choice lay before a man . it is a profound moment that can be defining . newline newline he looks at the bartender with intention to order his third . a brief exchange of words between them , too faint for me to hear . newline newline the third arrives and in that instant i know the man i m searching for is found .the barefoot traveller shook off his cloak as he entered the centre for worship , trying hard to blend in and failing spectacularly . newline newline people stared and giggled at his plain clothes , dressed as they were in the gaudy outfits and accessories that signified their belief in the dizzying array of gods to choose from . newline newline he kept his eyes averted and made his way through the crowds , listening intently to the conversation and taking in their ... costumes . newline newline one young woman wore a colourful , decorated bangle for every greek god she worshipped , making jarring music as she walked . a heavily tattooed man was debating the benefits of valhalla versus nirvana with a gentlelooking boy who wore nothing but a loincloth . newline newline  does this matter , though ?  another interjected , chugging down a beer and slapping the other two on the backs .  it s all true , people , that s what we need to remember . the gods would never be so cruel to make us choose between them .  newline newline the traveller stopped in his tracks and wheeled around to face the group . newline newline  what if there were ?  he asked .  what if everyone here is wrong about what is waiting on the other side ? what if there s only one god overlooked by you all , aggrieved and angry to see what has happened to his world ? to the lack of worship for him ?  newline newline they stared at him in silence for a few seconds , then burst out laughing . newline newline  aggrieved about not being worshipped !  the tattooed man said , his wild mane of red hair shaking as he laughed .  the gods would nt be angry if someone does nt worship them , man , that s why they re gods . they just are . and where is this mystery god of yours , if he s so pissed off ? should nt he be down here , trying to convince us , if he cares so much ?  newline newline  do nt mind eric ,  the woman with the bangles smiled at him .  look , we gather here to talk all this stuff through , so say what you like , my friend . what s your name ?  newline newline  er . yeshua ,  the traveller said .  is that familiar to any of you ?  newline newline they shuffled their feet awkwardly and gave strained smiles . he felt a pit in his stomach and hastily left the group . it was worse to face them because they were right . newline newline their gods did exist . newline newline anything powered by such wholehearted belief did . and because these people did nt particularly care whether their gods walked around on earth , he was currently the only deity in the room . well , former deity . he could feel his power ebbing away with the growing proof of his utter irrelevance in this world . newline newline he d hoped it would be a relief to return to earth : the empty space he labelled heaven  in his mind was overrun with an unbelievably noisy , petulant gaggle of gods . not to mention spiteful . zeus had been particularly amused to hear his story , and had zapped his sandals with a lightning bolt . accident , his ass . so he d come to earth . home . but far from relief , he had sunk into depression . noone believed in him . newline newline how should he even start building it up again ? when he d last seen earth , he d left it up to his disciples to tend the small flame of belief he d woken in his followers , until his return . he did nt even know what had happened to his friends . newline newline he wandered dispiritedly outside again , into a nearby bar that was almost deserted : the hugandmun inn . the barman nodded to him in a friendly fashion . the symbol of odin winked at yeshua from a chain around the man s neck . well , that explained the bar s name , at least . newline newline  happy worship day , brother ,  he said , and pushed a glass of wine across the counter .  on the house .  newline newline  thanks ,  yeshua said , sipping the drink and glancing at the only other customer , sitting next to him , moodily drinking a beer . newline newline  bad day ?  he asked . newline newline  worship day is always so noisy ,  the guy sighed .  i m an atheist . it gets old .  newline newline  how many atheists are there , would you say ?  yeshua asked in what he hoped was a casual voice . newline newline the young man raised an eyebrow at the odd question , but answered with a shrug .  oh , a few million or so , probably . we keep to ourselves , mostly .  newline newline yeshua pondered this as he took another sip . he should be depressed about that too , but really , this man and everyone like him was at least a dozen gods closer to the number they should be worshipping . it was a start . he could build something from this . newline newline he hoped desperately he still had the juice to pull off a trick or two , and beamed at the man . newline newline  well , i do nt like worship day either . it seems all wrong somehow ,  he said .  i have something to cheer you up .  newline newline he tapped the glass and groped for the majestic , booming voice he had once been able to pull off without any trouble . newline newline  want to see what i can do with this wine ?  newline newline    newline hope you liked my story ! you can find more of my work on rinkfinger . i had my reasons . it was as much a blow to my identity as it has been to all of yours . i developed this virus over the last ten years , and at this point , if you ve backed anything up in the last 2 years , it s got this code on it too . newline newline i do nt want communications to collapse , but the internet , which was supposed to carry the wealth of human knowledge has turned into a gutter of hate , circle jerks , and a blackhole into which countless hours are wasted . do you realize that games such world of warcraft and league of legends have sucked up hundreds of millions of man hours . useless conversations on boards , and in chat rooms are preventing human kind from moving forward . we are nt innovating , we are nt improving our lives . so i ve created this code . there are others that agree with me , and if the internet is rebuilt and not used more responsibly , this will happen again and again . thank you for your time .  newline newline he steps away from the podium , pulls out a small handgun , places it in his mouth and pulls the trigger . its simply natural selection  the administer said ,  eventually mankind will get to a point where no one will fail the test , where everybody and their children will not be potential freeloaders of our government just leeching off government revenue  as she inserted the flash drive into the machine . afterwards , she proceeded to pass out the bracelets used in conjunction with the test that release cyanide into your bloodstream if one s test results are not satisfactory . newline  what if the test is faulty  i asked . newline  excuse me ?  newline  yeah , what if you do have a use for society without a satisfactory score on the test ?  , the administer stared at me as if i was michele bachmann at a gop debate . newline  well that would nt happen as not receiving a satisfactory score on this test would mean you have failed to think logically and exercised poor judgement not fitting for those who deserve to live in our society  newline  who gets to decide what logically is ? say you see a 100 dollar bill and a 1 dollar bill on the floor , which one do you grab ?  newline  the hundred dollar bill of course  the administer replied with a smirk . newline  but why ?  newline  logically you grab the bigger bill since that means more money  the teacher replied hastily ,  now no more questions we must get back to the administering of the tes..  newline  you re wrong  the administer looked at me , baffled . newline  excuse me ? are you saying that grabbing the 1 dollar bill is the more logical choice ?  newline  nope  newline now she was confused ,  then what ?  . newline  logically you would grab both bills as it means more money  the teacher froze .  i guess the test did nt filter out those who did nt think logically after all .  you can  t bring them back , and i can  t kill him for you  . newline newline the man sunk to his knees , griefstricken . the hole in his heart was opening again . newline newline it was a routine robbery gone bad the police had said . his wife pulled the car around the block to make it seem like no one was home . they were planning on surprising daddy for his birthday . the burglar didn  t count on people still being in the house . newline newline she was found naked in the kitchen , signs of a struggle and forced postmortem intercourse . the children were found in the playroom , bound together with bed sheets . bullet wounds in the back of the skull showed no mercy . newline newline he came home and found the bodies . he felt the lives of his family dripping away , soaking his clothes as he held them tight . newline newline but he was dry , and the moment was gone . they were dead . newline newline he got up of his knees and looked to the genie . the genie spoke . newline newline  my people aren  t allowed to affect span of life in any aspect . you mortals have set in and out points.  newline newline he thought for a moment . newline newline  i wish to know the exact time and place the man who killed my family will die  newline newline the genie  s eyes glowed as he spoke  2:01am december 11th 2030 . st. ruth hospital , chicago il . room 223b .  newline newline  two wishes remain  newline newline the man shrugged a bit and spoke once more .  i wish to know when i will die  . newline newline unhesitant , the eyes of the genie shone bright again . newline newline  5:59pm april 21st 2049  . newline newline  one wish remains.  newline newline the man took a breath and raised his gaze to the genie . his eyes showed no remorse or pain , only vengeful purpose . newline newline  i wish to be sent to december 10th 2030 at st. ruth hospital.  newline newline  and give me a knife  newlinethe man had everything he had wished for  money , power , women . newline newline but he was growing old , and his time on the earth was coming to an end , and he was faced with a decision . newline newline so far he had averted his eyes from the effects of his actions . one of the star  studs  in the world , a glorified breeding horse . he had fathered hundreds of children , with no thought to the consequence of his actions . but it was different now . newline newline he dialled the number on the back of the card to arrange a life extension . newline newline only the strongest , healthiest babies for him  for they contained the most  potential  . that s one of the reasons he was a star  his seed had unmatched vigour and provided for some great extensions . newline newline he specifically picked out his own , out of a sense of pride and submitted it . newline newline  sign here , here and here newline newline and with that the waiting began . newline newline he was anxious to make sure the baby was delivered healthy , and made every effort to keep its vessel comfortable . newline newline that s what they were reduced to  studs and vessels . it suited them fine . newline newline she was not a first timer  those had often been known to change their mind and get cold feet . newline newline when the time came for the delivery there were complications  fears that the vessel might have to abort . newline newline fortunately for him  they pulled through . newline newline but then there was the bad news . newline newline one of the doctors had messed up in the pregnancy treatments , and the child was born with a brain  greatly complicating matters . newline newline he still had the option of infanticide if he wished to endure a lengthy legal battle , and it seemed like the last thing he d like to do  a waste of his time and money best spent elsewhere . but there was a fair amount of paperwork to add a person to an immortal society as well . newline newline he still wanted to extend his life , but for now he thought he could settle for some inferior specimens . newline newline he had a more pressing concern  he might have to be a father , and he was nt sure how to handle it .we have been walking for many many miles . this journey has taken us to many places and brought us many challenges . it is now the last leg of the trip and now we reflect on this journey we took together . we turn to the side of the road and we see nothing but a beautiful valley filled with vibrant colors and sparsely doted with trees . newline newline  wow . we have not seen something like this before the war .  zach said to us . newline newline  yup .  i answered . newline newline we walked down into the road below and then we saw a friend we never thought we will see again . newline newline  dylan !  i yelled to him . newline newline  will !  he yelled to me . newline newline we both hugged and talk about the times before , during and after the war . we all walked the rest of the way there . the war had tore and united us together in many different ways . now , as we walked to crystal lake city , we look behind us and smiled . newline newline our new lives have begun ... a mother dressed in flannel kittenprint pajamas lifts her young son and grabs her daughter s hand . she switches off the light and takes her kids to bed leaving a warm glow in the room . a green plastic christmas tree stands in the corner with white frosted needles a cranberry velvet skirt at its base and white lights twisted around it . candy canes and angels dangle among the branches with the occasional birds nest and glittering orb . an angel reaches up and unties the thread that attaches it to the branch . it falls to the branch below as others begin to wake . bluebirds in the nest begin hopping around and the awakened angels begin to dance . some toys slip out of their boxes and join in the dancing . all of the figures twirl and leap around the velvet and boxes in a joyful parade , dancing around and around the tree . a light filters into the frosty window and glints off the star atop the tree . the toys and angels look up and east , noticing the sunrise . they hurriedly climb back to their perches in the branches and retie themselves to their strings . the birds hop back into their nests just as the sun touches the tree s base and the room falls silent , just for a moment , to be broken by the soft patter of bare feet on the wood floors .its been a long time saladin but its time , i knew it would end like this after i made my first wish , omniscience is a pain like that , only it was what i had needed at a time , though my first wish i realized my second wish , my first made me realize there was no god and only a single universe , i fixed that in my second , allowing all possible actions and choices to spawn a separate universe , meaning all possible wishes i could make were granted to at least one version of me . of course this also meant that my last wish was essentially worthless , with all potential actions being taken and with all knowledge already in my possession i had no goals anymore , nothing to do , and nowhere to go , i though i could block it out with human interaction , but every conversation every single action i took had been done by me or would be done by me . newline newline it took me a long time to realize , but i still had one wish left , of course i had everything in existence , but what of outside of existence , there is a chance my omniscience does not work there , and with nothing better to do i m going to take it . newline newlinewas sally being foolish ? perhaps a little crazy ? maybe . her volcano flew in the face of a thousand cliches . in fact , just last year , we lifted the ban on a number of forbidden entries . volcanoes were at the top of the list , followed by ant farms and sea monkeys . newline newline the ban was put in place for the past ten years because of the sheer number of these textbook projects . for ten years we forced the kids to stretch their imaginations , rather than simply breaking the spines of their science books . newline newline but , there was sally , sitting there at her table . the grin on her face was impish , not at all like her usual reserved self . i could nt believe that this straighta honor roll student would pursue the most tired and boring of the projects . newline newline at first , i assumed she was just busy with her studies and came up on the deadline with nothing real to show . it must be a oneoff . she dropped the ball but was trying to save face . certainly , it could nt be anything else . only the most uninspired resort to something this basic . newline newline after a little rationalization , i decided that it did nt surprise me too much that she would skimp on the effort involved . she had a strong liking for archaeology , and would state time and time again that it was her passion . newline newline so , maybe science just was nt her strong suit . newline newline but that smile.. it betrayed something that i should have caught on to . newline newline her volcano was standard fair quality at first pass . it was about the size of an overturned bucket , paper mache , and possibly spray painted . it had a towel laid longways on the base of it s foot . this was presumably to ensure that any discharge was absorbed rather than dripping onto the floor . newline newline all the usual diagrams about the various type of volcanoes accompanied it : shield , cinder , composite.. boring stuff . possibly copied directly from the textbook . newline newline the interior of the volcano was illustrated , and the telltale vinegar sat to her left , a sure sign that she was going to dazzle me by making something  amazing  happen . i wondered , as i looked over this chickenwire monstrosity , whether she had dyed the baking soda held within . what color would i be looking at for thirty seconds as i tried to keep my boredom from showing ? newline newline  welcome to the world of volcanoes !  newline newline oh ? she was starting her presentation . well , i guess it was time to pay attention . newline newline  for eons , man has gazed at these pits of glowing magma with bewilderment ! what secret gods and demons dwell within ? how can we be safe ? and what actions can shield us from the horrors of the earth ?  newline newline well , if nothing else , it was attention grabbing.. newline newline  we will delve into this question , but first , we will need some volunteers !  newline newline i looked about , slightly confounded . there was only me judging her table . she was nt about to get audience participation from people shuffling by . newline newline just as my face expressed my confusion , she lifted the towel in front of the volcano with a flourish . newline newline  behold ! the mighty ant colony of pompeii the second !  newline newline i was now looking at a thriving ant colony , meticulously cultivated . the ants were large carpenter ants , nearly an inch long . they were forced to dwell in a small grecian city of sally s construction . there was no underground for them , only the detailed houses constructed to emulate an ancient municipality . the city was meticulous , to say the least . newline newline  ah ! there they are ! the citizens of my anttopia . they worship this mountain every day , not realizing that a shifting of tectonic plates is about to seal their doom !  newline newline at this , sally removed the tablecloth that surrounded the volcano . below was a cutaway of the tectonics below the volcano . the detail was of the highest quality . newline newline and below that was a metal box with a single button and tubes connected to what appeared to be a pressurized tank . newline newline it was at this moment that i noticed that the city of the ants contained an ocean as well . it was a fish tank , positioned in a way that it was visible from the front of the table , and it was filled with.. yes . it had to be . sea monkeys . newline newline sally plucked an ant from the city as i marveled at the detailed tectonic plates and the labels that described the fault line that was soon to erupt . newline newline  will a sacrifice to the gods appease the mighty volcanoes wrath ?  newline newline she dropped the ant into the cone with a cackle . newline newline  no !  newline newline as she pressed the red button , i watched as the plates separated , and a gush of hot steam flew from the top of the volcano . the sound turned heads and soon people gathered to watch . newline newline  nature produces some terrifying monsters , and not out of wrath . know that the very orb you are standing upon supports life by a tiny layer ! all else is lava and heat !  newline newline  and what of it s motivations ?  newline newline  the volcano s hunger for victims will not be quenched with this offering ! for the volcano s motivations are based on pressure and magma flows , not upon the follyful whims of man !  newline newline the crowd and i watched as a substance began to pour from the mountain top . but this was no baking soda and vinegar solution . this was silvery and hot . and it was burning the very structure it poured from ! newline newline  i must warn you not to touch the lava ! it is quite hot ! for your safety , please respect the wrath of nature as it releases the mass which must be displaced for harmony to be restored .  newline newline then she said with a smirk ,  i assure you all , that we are all quite safe . but , i can make no such assurances for the inhabitants below .  newline newline the lava poured forth . the side of the mountain burned and blackened as the silver magma poured forth . it followed previously unnoticed canals that revealed themselves as the mache burned away . newline newline i almost told her to stop . what she was doing was a fire hazard ! but.. i instead had to watch . it entranced me . she was a straighta student , and her confidence kept me from stopping the show . besides.. what could i do ? the magma was already flowing ! newline newline  the inhabitants of pompeii the second are going about their lives , unaware of the dangers that are descending upon them ! even now , they are only vaguely aware of the force of nature now headed their way !  newline newline she described in detail how they were eating their food , playing their games , and going about their daily lives , when the lava met the city . newline newline  and now , all is ash !  newline newline we watched in silence as the tiny ants were coated in silvery lava . newline newline another child cried for her to stop . she said she could hear them scream as they were encases in the eruption . and she was right . i could hear hissing , popping , and what sounded like a thousand tiny screams as the city was completely coated . newline newline it was jarring , and i had to remind myself that it was probably just steam . yes.. just steam being released like a lobster cooking . but it sounded so convincing . newline newline but this was not all . soon , a blackish tar flowed out from the volcano . newline newline  the metal will cool in mere moments , but let us now witness the passage of time  newline newline soon , the inhabitants of pompeii the second were completely covered , indistinguishable from the dirt that surrounded the little model city as the black river washed upon them and solidified . newline newline i was in such shock , i barely noticed sallie s explanation for how the lava had created an oxygen deficient dead zone in the ocean , where the sea monkeys were beginning to stop moving and sink to the bottom of the tank . newline newline  one day , archaeologists will uncover the secrets of pompeii the second . they will try to uncover the secrets of what happened to this lost civilization . they will remove dirt and debris , and see if they can find out how this once lush city flourished and floundered .  newline newline  science  she said ,  answers the question of how . and archaeologists answer the question of why it once mattered so greatly to us .  newline newline and that is when she put the tiny shovels and brushes on the table for the kids to excavate with . newline newline so , yes . i gave first place to a paper mache volcano . there was no way i could nt . it was by far the best presentation . newline newline the only thing that truly worries me , is that every time sally looks up in class , i m reminded of all those dying ants , and the way she killed them with a smile . i ca nt put my finger on it . it s like she was sending some bigger message to the world around her . something altogether about her as a person . calm , demure , but with something fiery welling within . newline newline it s probably all those lectures i ve attended about preventing violence and what warning signs to look out for . it must just be getting to my head . newline newline i do nt know why i keep wondering about that smile and what hides behind it . newline newline of one thing , i am certain . sally was right .  nature produces some terrifying monsters . i stared at the pale figure in the black business suit in disbelief , and he just stared back at me with a calm face . newline newline  well , adam ,  the wispy voice inquired . i swore a small smirk appeared on the gaunt visage on the other side of my desk .  what  s your choice ?  i looked down at the usb in my hand , and it suddenly felt as if it weighed a ton . how can i choose ? how can he make me choose ?  newline newline  i  i paused , the heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach feeling like a black hole that would absorb me from the inside out . how did it come to this ? what do i choose ?  newline newline newline    newline newline  immortality , evelyn ! can you believe it ?  i couldn  t hide the excitement in my voice as i left the voicemail for my wife .  i think i  ve done it ! i think i  ve finally cracked the god code !  i started pacing in front of my computer , my excitement keeping me from standing still .  please call me back as soon as you get this ! i want you here to sanity check my work . i just want to ensure that the data is correct before we share with the rest of the team tomorrow . i love you , honey . i  ll see you soon.  i hung up the phone took a deep breath .  we did it.  i muttered to myself . newline newline i took a minute to compose myself and then looked back at the screen in front of me . the data on the screen seemed to glow with an ethereal light , giving an eerie pale glow to my small office at our lab . i sat down at my desk and , for the third time , started to check the data to make sure that i had actually done it . newline newline part way through my check , i heard a knock at my door . i looked up in surprise at the door and then at the clock on my computer . it had only been about thirty minutes since i had called eve , and there was no way she could have made it to the lab this quickly , especially if she had been asleep .  evelyn ?  i called out ,  is that you ?  no one responded , so i got up from my desk and started towards the door . newline newline  evelyn ? come on in . it should be unlocked.  i reached the door and opened it , but to my surprise there was no one there . i looked out in to the lab , but it was dark and empty , just as it had been since everyone had gone home . i shook my head , feeling the lethargy set in from my lack of sleep .  i must be hearing things.  i muttered to myself . i closed the door and turned back around to my desk , and gasped when i saw someone standing in front of my computer . newline newline  hey !  i yelled , both surprised and angry from lack of sleep .  how did you get in here ? get away from that !  i quickly made my way towards the intruder , but froze when he looked up and locked eyes with me . newline newline standing in front of me was a tall , pale figure with thin , white hair in a sharp black suit . he had a gaunt face with skin that seemed to stretch across his skull like tight latex , but what really caught me were his eyes . when we locked eyes , i felt as if i was staring in to a dark , endless abyss from which there was no escape . newline newline  hello , adam.  he spoke in a soft , wispy voice that sounded almost like an autumn breeze : calm and wispy , but with a slight clod bite that made me physically shiver . i broke eye contact and made my way to side of the desk opposite him . newline newline  whowho are you ?  i inquired slowly , all surprise and anger gone and replaced by a sudden hesitation and wariness . the figure just stared at me with the same blank expression . newline newline  i have many names  the figures mouth moved , but his voice seemed to almost come from everywhere at once . an unsettling feeling started to gather in the pit of my stomach as the voice seem to wrap itself around my head and seep in to my ears . i felt myself shiver again .  hel . yeomra . osiris . mors . butthe one you are most familiar withis death.  newline newline i suddenly felt clammy and weak . i realized why i was shivering , and what the gathering feeling in my stomach was : fear . despite the reasoning and analysis that had driven me most of my life , i had no doubt , deep to the core of my being , that this man was telling the truth . i was in the presence of the grim reaper . i wanted to bolt and run , but the same fear was keeping rooted where i was . newline newline  now ... despite what your simple mortal mind may be thinking right now , if it is even thinking at all , i am not here to kill you . do you under stand ?  his voice never rose above a simple conversational level as if he was conversing with an old friend , casual and cool . i tried to respond , but all i could do nod . his expression never changed .  good . now that we have established that you aren  t going to die , please relax.  he motioned to the chair i had set up across from my desk for visitors . i quickly collapsed in to it , never taking my eyes off him . newline newline death calmly and slowly sat in my office chair .  now , let us discuss why i am really here.  he reached over and turned the computer screen to face me . i looked at the familiar god code and then back at him as it clicked . newline newline  you you  re here for the god code ? but that meansholy shiti did it.  death nodded slightly newline newline  yes , you did . however , it is not yours just yet.  he suddenly snapped his fingers and the computer screen went blank .  i just erased all traces of you and your team  s work . no matter where you had it saved , it is now gone . except  he reached in to the inside of his jacket and pulled out a small usb stick ,  for this.  he slowly placed the usb on the desk so that it was directly between us . i looked at him in shock and then down at the stick , processing what he just told me . again , despite no proof , i believed him fully . newline newline  now ,  he intoned ,  it  s time for you to make your choice.  my eyes snapped back to his , and i felt that cold abyss pull at me again , but my confusion and curiosity pulled me back . newline newline  what choice ?  throughout the whole conversation , death had maintained the same neutral expression and it had never changed , except now . now , a slight smile appeared across his lips , as if he was finally starting to enjoy himself . he motioned to the usb stick on the desk , and i slowly reached forward and picked it up . i slowly spun it in my hands , inspecting it casually as death started to speak . newline newline  your first choice is immortality for the human race . after sharing your discovery with the world , the world will change . but , unlike many pessimists would like to believe , it will change for the better . immortality for the whole of humanity will cause a shift in thinking that will lead to a bright future . a utopia will be made that will last for millennia . it will end , but everything ends eventually . the allpowerful has already decreed such . when the day comes , all will suddenly die peacefully , at the same time , as decreed . all of humanity will be happy . all of themexcept for you.  newline newline i suddenly snapped my eyes off the stick and back on to death .  me ? why ?  i leaned forward , feeling a sudden apprehension .  why would i be miserable if the entirety of humanity will be at peace ?  death just stated back at me with the same place , when suddenly my phone started ringing . i jumped at the sudden noise , and grabbed my phone . i saw the name  evelyn  flashing on the screen . i immediately answered it .  evelyn ? sweetie ? are you here ? meet me in my lab . we need to talk.  there was a pause , and then an unfamiliar male voice answered on the other end . newline newline  hello ? is this adam ?  the voice was firm and authoritative . i looked at the phone again to confirm it was my wife  s phone calling me .  yes , this is he . where is my wife ?  i heard a sigh from the other end . newline newline  i  m sorry sir . i regret to inform you , but your wife was in a horrible accident and is on her way to the hospital.  i suddenly felt the phone slip out of my hand and fall to the floor as i sat there in shock . my eyes locked with death  s again , and he nodded . newline newline  your second choice is your wife.  i felt my entire body go cold and tears appeared in my eyes . i started to shake my head . newline newline continued in part 2 so you re telling me ... nobody knows what the other one does ? not even the guards ?  i say as i look over to my cell mate , waiting him to repeat what he just said . newline  nobody  jerry said with an annoyed tone .  their ai nt a single man in this building who knows what it does  . jerry is a hulk of a man , with short brown hair and small eyes . i clearly irritate him , but he has learned to live with it . both of us had killed people before , jerry held up a bank and shot 4 people and injured two others while i had been involved in a hit and run . newline i was clearly bugging him , but i kept on digging for information . newline  but what about the people who make it ? surely they must know what it does ?  . i could nt believe what i was hearing . it just did nt make sense to me . jerry frowned and turned over on his bed facing away from me . he always does that when i pester him for information . i gave up and continued pondering my impending  decision  . newline so it turns out that there is a little known fact about capital punishment that very few know . capital punishment is a choice . ever since the government reforms of 2023ad and the overpopulation regulations , the government have been handing out capital punishment for most crimes . this has lead to a relatively safer society . of course there are still people who try their luck , which is why we are here . every person on death row is given two pills to choose from . one of these pills gives you a quick and relatively painless death . the other pill has only been taken by one person , who freaked out soon after taking it and managed to convince the guard to give them the other pill . needless to say that ever since people have only wanted to take the pill of death . newline but i m going to take the other pill . today is the day i find out what it does . if i m going to die here then i want this question answered . newline the thudding at the cell door tells me its time . i get up and say goodbye to jerry , who completely ignores me . i think this is his way of coping with me going . i m going to miss that big guy . newline the walk to the execution centre feels quicker than it should and we are there within 2 minutes . they have a long list of people being executed , they must be trying to rush this . newline the guards walk me into the room and close the door behind me . there is nobody in here , but there is a mirror along one of the walls that makes me think that someone is watching me . the only things in the room is a table , and the two pills perched on top . each pill is labelled either  a  or  b  . pill a is the death pill which i avoid . i lean over and pick up pill b , and quickly ingest it . newline nothing happens . i wait . i sit on the floor against the wall and i sit . what feels like hours past and i was left uninterrupted . newline newline that s when i see her . i glance up and see her standing there . she was still wearing the yellow dress . torn and covered in blood . i see the girl i hit with my car . newline newline then i hear her voice in my head . the questions . why did i leave her on the road ? where are her parents ? where is she now ? her lips do nt move but i can see it in her eyes . i feel the guilt in me rising . i do nt know how much more of this i can take . newline newline i can not live with this anymore . that s when i make the second decision . the one that i was always supposed to take .marcus peterson emigrated in 1970 from his native south africa to find success and adventure in america . over the next 45 years , marcus would become one of the world s most eccentric billionaires . newline newline on his trip to climb mount everest for the 3rd time , marcus never made it home , leaving his estate and all that came with it to his sons , phil and steve . newline newline phil peterson , one of new york s top litigation lawyers , had always wanted his father to sell his old and rotting estate in the hamptons .  you re too old to have a house that large , why do nt you downsize  he frequently reminded marcus . now was his chance to get rid of that mansion once and for all . newline newline phil s older brother steve was not ready to get rid of the house so quickly .  phil , this house is dad ,  he quipped . steve always dreamed about living in a mansion instead of the homeless shelter he s resided in since he divorced his gold digging wife irene . newline newline  why do you let phil push you around like that steve ? this is exactly the reason i divorced you .   irene newline newline little did they know their eccentric dad divided the house like a checker board to get his kids to finally be friendly after 10 years of avoiding each other . newline newline quick cuts newline newline  so you re telling me , that the only way we can figure out what to do with this house is to get along ?   phil newline newline  i know dad would want this house to stay in the family   steve newline newline  i m going to call my friends who specialize in real estate   phil newline newline newline newline introducing :  newline newline mark wahlberg as phil newline newline owen wilson as steve newline newline sophia vergara as irene newline newline and newline newline danny devito as marcus newline newline in newline newline check mate newline newline coming summer 2016i think that obama has done very well , newline newline newline creating change is a very hard sell , newline newline newline all of america should be grateful , newline newline newline living in a place where our leaders are faithful , newline newline newline large responiblities on his head , newline newline newline even i can understand that all the paperwork can kill you dead newline newline newline does it matter if he stops to play some games ? newline newline newline he probably does it so congress does nt drive him insane newline newline newline i could nt belive it when i heard him say , newline newline newline  mikeman666xxx ,  newline newline newline  all those kills mean nothing if you ve never had sex !  newline newline newline never before had i been so astounded , newline newline newline i could see nothing but red , as my blood pounded , newline newline newline getting up close to my television screen i prepared my response newline newline newline gulping in breath , i shouted my taunt . newline newline newline even now i regret it , after 20 years , after 30 , till the end of time , newline newline newline read the first letter of each line . harold , dear ,  she muttered , taking his arm and hobbling along  where did you say the rest room was again ?  as much as she hated to admit it her incontinence was a real issue now but prevention  meaning going every half an hour or so  was the key . harold chuckled , a pleasant grating sound like two love heart shaped sandstones rubbing together .  it s just up ahead , my love . we ll get you there .  and so they walked , her soft shoes scraping lightly , his pocket watch clinking . it was awful noisy in the mall today , edna noticed . she also had nt seen bertha today . perhaps she would see bertha later , maybe for coffee . bertha was ever so nice . they were walking past the patisserie  it was once a cafe , the cafe her and harold had stolen away their first kiss , quickly and awkwardly , but here they were 68 years later  . newline newline what sweet edna and poor harold had failed to notice   her eyes !  ,  and his ears !  as they liked to say often  , however , was the librarian chewing off the hairdresser s face off . a poop of blood was flowing from the hair salon , through the door , black and coagulating . the hairdresser no longer kicked and thrashed as she once did , rather began stirring . the librarian  an old cronie herself  had just taken a sizable chunk from her face when she began to sit up , slowly and mindlessly . whatever she now was , it had sensed the old couple as they migrated towards the crapper . newline newline  ... and i need to ... well , dear we need to call paul . we have nt spoken to him in almost at month . oh and the children ! it should be nice to hear their voices .  harold was turned completely off , his wife s droning naught but white noise  sometimes he had even had entire conversations with both his hearing aids off and come out of it with some late night hanky panky involving denture gum and an old halffull jar of opium they had stored away from the war  . newline newline like some sort of perverted tag team wrestling match both the librarian and the hairdresser had begun to advance on the two lovers , moaning and groaning and braaaaaaiiiinnnnnning . only , zombies do nt play by rules and they definitely do nt know what wrestling is . not anymore , anyway . unfortunately for them , they were slow . the librarian was on her 6th hip replacement and had devoured most of the other woman s legs  and face and tits and thighs , like some weird lesbian porn gone very wrong  and they were firmly second place in the race to get edna to a toilet seat before her  literal  granny panties became a valid substitute .it s strange the things we do out of instinct . there s some sort of evolutionary force within us that sometimes we just cant overcome despite our best efforts . i think about that a lot now . i think about whether i could ve helped it  if i could ve chosen somehow to not love her . i do nt think it would ve made a difference either way , because she will never know . someone else loved her more , someone who owned the red camaro i saw driving around town all the time . i do nt know his name or really what he looked like , it was far too gone by the time i could look . i thought he was the only one in the car . i let it burn . i was wrong .what i had in front of me was a building made of rough stone , and what seemed to be a capsized viking ship used as a roof , with rotting wood planks , and hay , and tar to shield its contents from the rain . a cobblestone path led to the heavy wooden door . on the door , a mightily decorated doorknock in the shape of a dragon s head stared furiously at me . newline newline i approached the door , my boots thumping softly on the stone . i raised a hand to the doorknock , and hit the wood twice . the heavy door opened thunderously , and a decrepitly old woman was standing behind it . a dark green robe , small eyes and her skin like oak bark , she was holding a stick taller than her , with a face roughly carved into its wood , and trinkets and tiny colored vials attached to it . newline newline  oh , you re here , maximilian . please , do come in , shrug the cold off your shoulders  . she said , and welcomed me inside . newline newline a great hall , full of displays carved in marble and granite or cast in various metals adorned the area . on each of these , a weapon . newline newline  i know you come from an era of information  , she said  and you may recognise most of these weapons  . newline newline and she was right . i walked in front of one of the displays where i could recognise the mighty mjlnir , together with megingjr and the gloves jrngreipr . their shape shifting , now showing a crude stone , a loincloth and fur gloves , now a golden warhammer and a finely decorated belt and platinum gauntlets , now a normal tool hammer with a toolbelt and work gloves . newline newline  the shape of these artifacts shifts to adapt to the different ages they had seen . this hall lies outside time and space . a hero s weapon is nt a tool . it s a concept . an idea . what was excalibur once , in your time may be a fountain pen used to sign peace between nations , and who knows what in the future .  newline newline i strolled around the displays . different weapons i recognised , excalibur , gaebolg , cupid s bow . each one glimmering and shifting in shape , color , form , and size . newline newline at last . newline newline i heard a voice . a deep , sensual murmur . newline newline  i can hear you . i can ... feel you .  i whispered . then , following what one may call instinct , i directed my steps to a far corner of the hall . newline newline i was standing in front of a dusty wooden log , with no light shining on it . and more curiously , the shape of the weapon i had in front of me was not shifting . it was just ... that . a thick , short blade , with two cuts on the flat side . it had no grip , it was just the soul of a japanese tantou . newline newline i knew very well what it was . i felt my hand moving on its own , to grab the crude blade . as i touched it , it morphed in my hand , becoming the most beautiful santoku knife i had ever seen . its steel was shining and glimmering , its damascus waving on the surface , moving . then , the blade spoke . newline newline i am houchou masamune . are you worthy of wielding me ?  newline newline i did nt let the blade finish . i pressed the blade against the palm of my right hand , and slashed it . my blood dripping on the knife . i winced from the pain . newline newline i am houchou masamune . and we re going to be the best chef of the world . a cup ! a cup you say ? yes ! this is a cup ! what kind of cup , you may ask . did you ask ? yes you did ! well , this is no ordinary cup . this cup is ... sort of special . it s a special cup ! and there are reasons that this cup is special ! wait for it , wait for it ... bam ! it s a mug ! special mug cup ! why is a mug such a special cup ? well , it comes with two great features ! first , a built in handle ! second , it s a cup ! and this cup did something amazing . after it s owner had his coffee , this cup was dropped ! dropped like rainfall ... into the ocean . colliding , a force finally smashing into an immovable object . lost , forever , into itself . a soul , wandering , lost forever , in the abyss . unloved , untouched , until it was swept up by steven . then , steven got a new mug from the cupboard . this was his favorite cup . he loved this cup , and no cup was like this cup . this cup made him so happy . after filling this cup with orange juice , steven finished his breakfast , and went to school .i tried to catch my breath as i took in what he d said . newline newline a drop of blood fell across my eye from the cut i d taken on the forehead and i angrily reached up to dash it away so it would nt impair my vision . i knew that it left a bright smear of red across my face and did nt care . all that mattered was the fight . newline newline  well ?  newline newline he stood across from me , the clatter of battle around us had faded into the background . they d cleared a ring of space for us as we fought , the intensity of our battle drawing a healthy amount of battlefield respect from them , even as they fought and died in their own battle . newline newline soldiers knew . knew what it was to appreciate skill and prowess so far beyond their own , even in the midst of their own desperate struggle for existence . newline newline  ... what ?  even that word was a struggle to articulate . the battle had been going on all day and i was tired . newline newline  look at them , solan ,  my opponent waved his hand out to the side , gesturing to all the others .  they do nt know why they re here , do they ? they think they re here for their king , or their government , or their families . they fight for impure reasons and their battle is impure because of it .  newline newline he sheathed his sword , letting it glide back into the scabbard that hung from his belt . newline newline  it s different with us . there s a reason they call you the berserker ,  general .  newline newline  put up your sword ,  i said through gritted teeth .  our fight is nt over yet .  newline newline  yes , it is ,  he said , spreading his arms to the side , leaving himself vulnerable if i should choose to strike .  i felt it from you , and i know you felt it here too . the purity . you and i are cut from the same cloth , solan . we do nt fight for any other reason than because we can . because it s what we re good at . it s what we were born to do . this battlefield , solan ? it s unworthy of us . it s unworthy of men of our talents and skills .  newline newline my grip tightened on my sword . i longed to take that last step , thrust , put an end to this war . despite the whims of the power mad king that had invaded , everyone knew that it was this man , their warleader , who was the tactical genius behind their strategies . he had been the driving force behind the conflict , and the war would falter without him . newline newline but ... he was right . there had been something here , when i met him in battle on the bloodsoaked field . a purity and cleanness that i d never felt in battle before , and knew i would never feel again . newline newline i longed for it . needed it . lusted after it . newline newline  alright , talk ,  i said shortly , sheathing my own sword . newline newline  warriors of our caliber deserve a fitting stage to showcase their skills , their pure ideals and motivations . this war ?  he waved his hands again , encompassing the battlefield .  this war is nt it . it s undeserving of us . it s unfulfilling . let s make a better one .  newline newline i did nt want to admit it to myself , i did nt want to acknowledge its truth ... but it could not be denied . a clear and singing fury burned through me and i felt it again , something i thought i d lost a long time ago . it burned in me again and i knew that i d finally found my match . i knew that i would never rest until i knew , once and for all , which of us was better . newline newline and i knew that a battle of such purity deserved , no , needed a better stage than this one . newline newline  three years .  i said .  we ll meet again three years from today , right here . you find people of like mind and so will i .  newline newline  and then ?  he asked at my back as i turned my back on this war , already in search of the next . newline newline  and then we ll see , wo nt we ? who really is the better warrior between us . who s purity of purpose will see them to victory .  newline newline  yes ,  he said . and even without seeing it , i knew that a battleready grin was stretched across his lips . knew it because the same was stretched across mine .  yes we will . the room was quiet and cool . all i could see is the white tiles that covered the walls and floor as well as my reflection in the two way glass infront of me . i was reclined in a chair designed by a whole team of engineers , hooked up to a machine that cost more money to develop than i d ever see in a lifetime . i could feel cold electrodes against multiple points on my head , shaved for the procedure . newline newline i was nervous , everyone one , though the people who put blood , sweat , tears and untold number of hours of their life into this project were nt putting their life on the line . they said the transfer process was painless , and effortless , but there was the risk of not being able to come back . i did nt really want to come back anyway ... i had nothing else left here which made me a perfect candidate . newline newline the transfer will begin in one minute .  a voice said over an hidden speaker somewhere in the featureless room . we re performing our final calculations . stay calm , everything will be fine . half of the project has been designed by our ai and has eliminated any room for human error . you are in good hands .  newline newline i took a deep breath . stay calm , everything will be fine . i started to think about the other side . i wondered how it would be to be within the machine . to digitize my consciousness . they had created a virtual reality interface for me on the other side where they would conduct further tests . newline newline  transfer commencing in 3 ...  i closed my eyes , prepared for ... whatever comes next ,  2 ...  deep breath . stay calm ,  1 ... activate .  newline newline blackness . like someone turned off a light switch . newline newline then light . nothing but white . newline newline i looked around . i was nt in the chair , at least not the same chair i was in . it was an old reclining chair , dusty and tattered . i was naked , but looked like a ken doll , smooth all over for whatever reason . newline newline in front of me , i saw a table that i could swear was nt there a moment ago . on it : a white envelope with subject 01  written on it and a tv remote next to it . i guessed that the envelope was for me ... subject 01 was what i was referred to by the engineers . i opened it up , ignoring the remote for now . newline newline in the envelope was a letter . on it were the words : press power .  newline newline i looked to the remote and back at the letter . these guys made a really weird interface for me . but i guess this is all about research and experimentation . i followed the instructions and pressed power . newline newline a screen appeared in front of me , hanging in the air . it was the room i was in ... that i am in . newline newline it appears something went wrong with the transfer .  a voice said , coming from screen . newline newline  seems that way .  a familiar voice said . for a moment i could nt put my finger on who s voice it was , but then it hit me with a shock : it was mine . someone came and helped the person in the chair out of the chair helped me out of the chair . what was going on ? newline newline  we re experiencing technical difficulties with our computer systems . something went wrong with our a.i .  the voice said over the intercom ,  we ll get this figured out , just come back in tomorrow and we ll get this transfer right .  newline newline the man in the room ... me ... nodded and started to leave the room . before he did , he glanced towards the camera , smiled and left ...added another story to the growing

any normal day , i was driving along 391 at about 55 . not speeding not going slow . i saw a white car , just sitting on the highway with the door open . i thought the car looked familiar , and i pictured my friends car and matched up the license plates i my head . it was his . i slow down , switch lanes , and park next to the car . nothing was strange except the face that he was nt in the car . he was nowhere to be found actually . on the way walking back to my car to call him on his cell to see what was up , i glanced at the woods beside the highway . there was matted down grass footprints leading into the woods . the wind of the passing cars was quick and harsh . it lessened as i took small steps towards the woods . it was about 19:00 , getting dark quickly . should i have gone back to my car to call him , or just go into the woods ? we all make mistakes , i guess . i walked closer to the woods . i heard a stick crack and some rustling leaves . must have been a rabbit i thought . nothing else is in these woods . i was wrong . newline newline i pushed aside a small vine bush and took a step into the woods . the air was cooler in here than it was outside . i could see maybe 25 yards before it got too dark to see good detail . i saw the trail of footprints in the leaves and walked forward . i slid my hand across a tree . there was a sharp piece of bark sticking out . i looked closer and noticed there were 2 deep slashes in the tree . i ignored it and kept walking . i called his name a few times with no response . 5 minutes of walking and still nothing . as i walked a little more , i saw something on the ground . i ran up to the lump and noticed it was my friend lying on the ground . i shook him and he did nt wake up . i called his name and slapped his face . no reaction . i looked up and around , but no one was here . it was only us . just then i heard a voice .  you ca nt save him .  i spun around and there was nothing . only the woods . it was almost pitch black at this point . i turned back around and there was a face inches from mine . it was long and skinny , white as snow . skin was covering the eyes and mouth of this thing . i could not speak . i could not move . fear was struck in me . then his cheekbones rose , as if this creature was trying to smile . it then shook violently and ran off to the right . it was lost in the dark . i remember being struck in the back of the head and blacking out . newline newline i woke up in my car later that night , alone , at 2 in the morning . my friends car was gone . i wasted no time and turned on my car and sped away . newline newline yeah i m not sure where i was going with that .light faded . humming fans buzzed to a stand still . the blue eye of omnos winked closed for the final time , leaving behind hollow glass and a cold titanium frame . with the flip of a switch man s dream , his nightmare , ended . in the cool air of the server room , they found little evidence of the greatest empire ever assembled  silica , fused wire , racks and racks of motherboards shelved like so many miniature elysiums caught in a web of cable wires . there were no battlements smote , no palaces smoldering , no treasure plundered , no people broken and begging at their feet . instead , there were five people , not even proper warriors , bloodied and bedraggled , staring across the void into the dying reflection of imagined perfection . they could hardly look . after the realization of what they had accomplished set in , they began to watch each other uneasily , uncomfortable with what they had managed and what reality they would leave behind . the world of omnos was that of a machine  orderly , predictable , stable . the world of man was something else . really daddy , i heard something , scratching at the window !  little alex cried , pointing at the bedroom window from where he cowered under his blankets . newline newline ian rubbed his tired eyes  it was three in the morning , they both should have been sleeping . he did nt want to deal with this . not now . not after the week they both d had . all the same , his son did nt seem like he was going back to sleep any time soon , not until his fears were assuaged , at any rate . ian walked over to the window and peered out into the back garden . the sky was dark , not a star in sight , nor was even a sliver of moon visible against the velvety black . it was had been raining all night and the clouds were still thick . the yard was dark and the only light came from what filtered throuh alex s bedroom curtains . despite this , ian could still spot the source of the scratching noises . sandra , his wife and alex s mother , was standing just a few feet from the window . newline newline upon seeing him standing in the window , she started scrabbling at the sill and the frame , trying to open the window . when she could nt , she stared pleadingly into her husband s eyes . it was freezing outside , the rain was starting to come down again , and she was soaked to the bone . ian stared back at her and the minutes stretched on for what felt like ages . then alex spoke again , his little voice breaking the trance . newline newline  daddy , what s out there ?  newline newline ian shook himself , then drew the curtains closed .  come on buddy ,  he said as he turned around and picked his son up ,  you can sleep in my room tonight .  alex was more than happy with this offer . he clung happily to his father as ian carried him to his room and tucked him in . the television that sat on top of his dresser did nt get cable , so he put in one of alex s favourite dvds . the little boy dropped off to sleep within minutes . that was good  ian could hear sandra scratching at his window now , still trying desperatly to get into the house . newline newline he was nt going to be sleeping that night , not while knowing she was out there . instead , he d be up the rest of the night , waiting for dawn and the rising of the sun . he d take alex to his mother s house down the street , and then he d go pay sandra a visit . this could nt keep happening . it had been a week . she could nt keep coming back like this . sooner or later alex would realize what was happening . newline newline i should have buried her at a crossroads , ian thought as he settled deeper into the pillows and tried to ignore the scratching . he knew what the risks would be after that damned cat had jumped over sandra s body . his father had insisted that they cut her head off to be safe , but ian could nt bear the thought of doing that to her . she had been the love of his life and the mother of his child . besides , the legends were just legends . that s what he had told himself . the stories were just stories and the dead did nt come back . newline newline well , he was wrong . sandra had come back , and when morning came , he d have to deal with her .the forest became quiet . the birds chirping , leaves dancing , and noise of cicadas all silent . all the soldier could hear was his steadying breath , distant coughing , quiet mumbling . every few minutes he would grip his rifle as tight as he can readying for the moment he would need to use it , but nothing happened . there was nothing but silence . newline newline he welcomed this uncomfortable silence . it calmed his nerves and allowed him to keep his composure . first day of battle may be his last day was all he thought . there was no glory , no show of bravery , nor inspiring moments in the last few hours . those few hours consisted of only cowardly retreat and death . he was ordered to retreat , his whole platoon was or what was left of it . he felt like a coward although it was orders he was following . was it because of orders or fear of dying ? a question he was afraid to answer . newline newline a soft moan startled him . it was enough to pull him out of his thoughts . it came from the riverbank downhill from his position . was it an enemy soldier or a friendly ? he could nt tell from the blood and mud that coated to figure s uniform . the figure with only one arm operable was begrudgingly pulling himself towards the dryer part of the riverbank . every few seconds he would stop and moan in pain then start to move again . he got quieter as he approached the riverbank and once on dry land stopped moving . no sound or movement came out of him . he was dead . newline newline the soldier gulped and took a deep breath to calm himself . he was used to seeing death but his mind took damage from this one . the river was shallow , only reaching up to his knees . bodies littered the river . because of how shallow the water is the bright silhouettes of bodies were clearly visible to him . bodies stacked up on each other some high enough to act as cover . it will be a sight that would never leave the soldier s mind . newline newline a firm hand patted him on the shoulder . it radiated compassion and care , something he has nt felt all day and something he desperately needed . it was his squad leader , a grizzled veteran . he was short and stocky yet had the age lines of one older than his age . his uniform was dirty , ripped , and caked with both blood and mud . he gave a reassuring look to the soldier and told him they ll be fine . he wanted to make sure his men were still sharp and ready for the next attack . newline newline an attack that came as quiet and swift as the wind . whizzes and pings sounded off at once near him . the soldier ducked in time to see the bullet holes on the rock face behind him . within a moment the forest erupted in the sounds of gunfire , explosions , and the dying screaming for their mothers . newline newline his squad leader pulled him up and out of his moment of shock . the soldier gripped his rifle tight and fired at the general direction his squad was firing at . he did nt know where the enemy was , but he felt safer firing together with his squad . ducking to reload the soldier takes quick glances to his left and right . he saw soldiers firing their guns like mad men , soldiers cowering behind their cover , and bodies that were lying in pools of blood . newline newline from his left a scream echoed out the directions and whereabouts of the enemy . soon after a deafening scream of machine gun fire showered an area of trees and rocks . the area was where most of the fire was coming from . the only reason the soldier had an idea of where the enemy were was because of his comrades yelling out positions . he wanted to look and yell out for positions too , but he did nt want to the end up the soldiers lying down on the group in a pool of their own blood . newline newline a younger comrade a little farther away from the soldier stuck his head out to get a clear view of the riverbank downhill . in the middle of him yelling directions a colorful blast of red coated the tree behind him and his body dropped dead . it was missing a head . the soldier was ordered to man one of the heavy machine guns overlooking that same downhill riverbank . reaching the gun the soldier had to move several bodies that stacked and piled around the gun . he took quick glances towards the bank and fired blindly into where the was guessing the enemy were at . if his head came up and the wrong moment he would end up joining the pile behind him . this was a thought he was struggling to shake off . newline newline a few other soldiers joined his position helping to suppress the enemies and put up an aggressive wall of bullets . he felt more safer and confident in sticking his head up to see the enemy . once the fire ceased around that area the soldier and his few comrades moved quickly to a new spot to help support the dwindling soldiers holding against an endless amount of enemies . newline newline the area they were defending was dry empty space . it was the fastest way uphill and the most deadly from lack of cover . however the piling bodies provided to be good cover for an aggressive advance . his squad leader knew that defending that area would be fruitless and pure suicide , but it was enough to buy time for the wounded to pull back . newline newline they were slowly being overrun with the enemy running into foxholes readying their bayonets . the soldiers closest to the enemy were already dead , either through gunshot wounds or stab wounds . the soldier was able to pick off few enemies jumping into his trench . one enemy soldier he shot right in the windpipe . the enemy soldier grabbed his throat as he gasped for air . his blood spraying out of the wound and misting the soldier . newline newline they were pulling back . the wounded have moved up to safer ground and those the were able to pull out in time were quickly digging in preparing for the assault . the soldier was one of the last few to stay behind covering for his retreating comrades . as he pulled himself out of the trench and started his run to safety several bullets whizzed past by him . a few ended up tearing through his right thigh and leg causing his femur to shatter . newline newline the pain was excruciating , he wanted to scream but he did nt . he had to conserve his energy and try to crawl uphill . however he knew that climbing uphill would be impossible because if the enemy bullets killed him the amount of blood he s losing will . he was nt going to make it , yet he still trying to crawl upwards . his comrades supporting him as best as the can drawing fire from him and returning twice the amount of fire they re drawing . the thought of his comrades risking themselves for him to get to safety was enough encouragement for him to at least try . newline newline he was nt going to make it . the support he was getting dwindled as his comrades retreated further back or died trying . it was bleak yet he did nt want to die in vain . he crawled into a small crater where a dead soldier with a machine gun laid . with adrenaline powering him he wrestled the gun from the tight grip of the dead body and position himself to face the enemy . newline newline if he was to die he wanted to die as a hero facing great odds yet still fighting on bravely . he wanted to prove to himself that he was nt a cowered even if it involved his death . he opened fire , the machine gun spraying in random directions as he tried to steady it . he was able to slow down the advance though taking down several of the enemy and causing the others to pull back to cover . newline his volume of fire was unrelenting . it reached to the point where the enemy were too afraid to fire back knowing that they d receive more fire than they d send . newline newline the soldier s vision was starting to fail and his body starting to relax . he still kept his tight grip on the gun and glued his finger on the trigger . he was nt going to die as a coward he was to die with glory . eventually he succumbed to his wounds yet his finger still on the trigger expending all the remaining bullets leaving only a clicking noise . newline newline because of the amount of time the soldier was able to buy in his last stand the comrades immediately the opportunity to counter attack as the enemy hid behind their cover afraid of getting shot . with roars of lions and screams of sirens the remaining troops ran down the hill bayonets out finding any exposed solder to impale . the enemy could nt react in time . the enemy soldiers panicking started a sloppy retreat with many of them cut down with both gunfire and bayoneting . newline newline the soldiers comrades were able to win that battle pushing the enemy back with an aggressive counter attack . they quickly won back the land they lost and caused the few remaining enemy troops to surrender . it was a bloody but great victory for them . the soldier s comrades erected a large wooden cross on the hill he died on as a way to remember his sacrifice . his name and who he is may have been lost in yet , however the cross still stands there today . the cross now marble stone and no longer wood . the aging comrades that are still alive come every often to honor and give respects to the soldier . newline newline he was an unnamed soldier that became an unnamed hero turning the tide of war to his people s victory . newline newline his name forgotten , but his legacy always remembered .it was a dark and stormy night , newline newline and through the fristle forest trees , newline newline a manor comes in sight , newline newline where walter watcher lives and sees . newline newline he sees the bloodless bimble smolder , newline newline in his flaming den beneath , newline newline making warmer days the colder , newline newline drawing heat to boil children s teeth . newline newline it was there that wilma winter went , newline newline upon the path that spirits beat , newline newline to find the flower fwinttlefent , newline newline to spice her soup that winter s eat . newline newline but when upon a manor dark newline newline she stumbled , knocked , and grinned ahoy !  newline newline the manor master bent to hark , newline newline and prepared for

she sat down she ll never know why . newline newline perhaps twas his eyes , alight and afire , newline newline perhaps twas his manner , his stance , his face , newline newline perhaps his manor , a thing to admire , newline newline swallowed the will of the winter entire . newline newline but there on the stool , in the fristle so black , newline newline she sat with walter watcher looking ,

always watching her .  she is a weapon . and like any weapon , she must be cared for with great vigilance and control . do you expect me to leave a cask of gunpowder open out on the street where any fool can get to it ?  master hullum once told a colleague from the college over a lunch of fried eel . newline newline  she is hardly a weapon , hullum ,  stiffshouldered arcanist wynters said , taking a sip of tea .  she is a girl , nearly fourteen . she has a right to privacy . and she has a right to learn the proper fundamentals of magic . not the watered down muck that you are teaching her . i mean , really , the fundamentals of a circle in correlation to the distribution of magic ? do you take her for a toddler ?  newline newline  i take her for someone with aspirations ,  hullum sighed .  she wants to achieve greatness . she wants to be the next eva the great , josephine the wise , dalla the cunning . but she will only ever be moira , a poor girl cursed by her mother . if i teach her any further , she ll no doubt become one of the greatest arcanists the world has ever seen . but the risk is not worth the reward .  newline newline  tell me more about this curse ,  arcanist wynters said , nibbling down on a minisandwich .  in the letter you sent a few years back when you first made her your apprentice , you described her as a living bomb  . harsh words .  newline newline  she is a siphon for magic . her mother , may the gods punish her dearly , died and with her final breathe cursed moira with a spell far beyond my comprehension . magic clings to her , but it does not leave her . it is building up and one day ... well you know the rest . do you remember what happened to the old college ? what our master s used to tell us ?  newline newline  the big boom ?  the arcanist recalled . newline newline  they were sitting in class one day and a professor by the name of huxlet was teaching a rather bland seminar . it turns out a similar curse was placed onto him by a disgruntled student . within a month , the magic built up and he exploded . an entire building crumbled , because of the high magical concentration of the college it all just clung to him . that took a month . she has lived for a few short years and i m afraid her time will be coming soon .  newline newline  you mean to keep her here then ?  wynters asked . newline newline  i do .  newline newline  if another big boom occurs and she ... you know . then you will die to , old friend . a merciful man would kill her and be done with it . he would use a draught of sleep to soothe her then do the deed himself . but you would die alongside her ? for what ?  newline newline  i could never harm her ,  hullum said with sadness in his voice . he took a sip of tea and looked to the window , where the arcanum tower stood a few feet from his cottage .  i suppose it is me being selfish then . i ca nt bare to see her go and i will take as many extra moments as i can to teach her , to help raise her . the plague took my wife long before i was ever able to have children , arthur . she is the closest thing to a daughter i have ever known .  newline newline arthur wynters rose and wiped the crumbs from his robe .  you are a queer sort of man , hullum . what happens when it finally happens then ? will you watch her explode , see the suffering in her eyes as the world she knows ends in the blink of an eye ?  newline newline  i will sit beside her and hold her hand ,  hullum said , smiling .  and hopefully , in those last moments she will not hate me for being so selfish . they were always dropping me into different countries . turns out when you declare yourself as  mobile  , they take it to extremes . now , where was i ? oh , yeah , iraq . sure , they told me it was a green zone where i was going , but when you get sent out to a job with a flak jacket waiting for you in the backseat , you completely rethink the briefing and whether it was worth the trouble .

sometimes i wonder why i m so confident . i should be running in the other direction as fast as i can , but all i can think of is my goal . lydia . newline newline  you know rain , just cause you re named after some ancient hero does nt mean you need to die fighting something bigger than you . your sis is probably dead already ...  han trails off . he saw something in my eyes there , even though i held myself back . they say you can see someone s soul if you look in their eyes while you talk . there are stories of wise old men besting skilled young mindshapers like that . i do nt believe the stories , but han saw something . newline newline  if you want to flee , you can . but you ve come this far , and the counters are probably hunting us now . not my problem though .  i put some steel in my voice there . han s actually paled , like he s more afraid of me than of the thing in the castle . i turn away , and at the same time reach out cautiously , brushing his mind . he jumps with a shriek , and i laugh . so does bannon , who s kept silent so far . newline newline  not funny !  newline newline  yes it was . you sounded like a pig !  bannon compares han to a pig every chance he gets . everyone else stopped finding it funny years ago , but he keeps at it . newline newline  well , i thought it was  newline newline  if it was the owner you would nt have had time to scream . and we ve been practicing shaping like that every day for the past week . you re just tense .  han turns red now , and i head off the inevitable pig joke from bannon .  come on . you try and get into my head now , and i ll keep you out .  newline newline i keep the three of us sparring until sunset . various combinations and goals . bannon can fight off both of us at once , and han s slippery . like a muddy pig , apparently . i ca nt keep either of them out if they get close , so i end up focusing on just slapping them away . it works all right , but one of them will be able to attack faster than i can parry . no that they d be able to keep one out either though . we re mostly practicing for the sake of it . just to defy the laws against it , since we re breaking bigger ones anyways . eventually , i call a halt . no point keeping watch , we re dead if we get spotted anyways . better to just all get a good sleep . tomorrow is big . tomorrow is when we ll all probably die , and it still does nt seem real to me . newline newline  newline newline bannon s up first , which is unusual . does nt take long to find out why . he s cooking bacon . han acts annoyed , but i know he s just as glad for one last joke as i am . we ca nt delay too long though . it seems like no time has passed before it s midmorning and we re standing at the gates to the castle . newline newline  well , lets go .  there was probably an inspiring speech i could have given , but i do nt feel up to it . maybe han s right about me taking my namesake too seriously . too late to worry now though . we re being watched , i can feel it somehow . newline newline we pick our way up the path in silence , crunching over the fallen leaves . i wince every time a twig snaps , as though it s the difference between life and death . we reach the keep without incident , and i break the silence . newline newline  well , last chance to back out !  i look over at han , and smile to show i m joking . he smiles back . for all our misunderstandings , we re together here . newline newline  forget about me ?  i smile at bannon too . as one , we step inside . newline newline the bowels of the keep are lit , surprisingly , by small balls of light that shine without flickering . i do nt spend much time inspecting them though , as i gaze on what centuries of habitation by an owner have made this place into . newline newline water pools on the floor in puddles so large they have small fish swimming about . not just tree roots , but entire trees have grown in here , struggling to claim the meager light from the spheres and the windows , most of which are just empty frames . the buzz of insects is everywhere , as are the lizards . newline newline or , at least they look like lizards . lizards with wings on their backs . leathery wings , like those of bats , sprout from the back of the lizards  necks . as i watch , one jumps of its perch and glides unsteadily over a pool , it s mouth open to devour insects that ca nt get out of the way in time . as i turn my head to follow its glide , i find myself picking out shadows , waiting for one to move . then it lands at her feet , and i forget about caution . newline newline  lydia  i scream , rushing through a puddle which fortunately is nt very deep . it is nt until she turns her head to face me that i realize something is wrong . lydia is wearing a black sleeveless dress which reaches down to the round , contrasting with her pale arm . far more pale than she had been a week ago . as pale as a corpse . she is wearing an iron tiara , adorned with long spikes that reach up over her head . except for a few streaks , her blond hair has become black . it s longer than it was before , flowing down over her back . and over her wings . somehow , in my joy at seeing my sister i had missed the thin wings , like those of the lizards , that protruded from below her shoulders . and her eyes . my sister has black eyes now . i stumble placing my hand against a twisted root for support , still ankle deep in dark water . she does nt smile at me . newline newline  you should not have come , little brother .  that does nt sound like her voice , it s cold and distant , like she s just an uninterested observer rather than my sister as of a week ago when she was taken . i open my mouth , then close it again . i do nt know what to say , how can i tell her that i rushed out after her , to save her , despite all our arguments and teasing ? how can i be sure this is even my sister ? then i hear the screams . newline newline i spin , and see han running in my direction . bannon is nt behind him . bannon is thrashing in the grip of a tendril of water that is reaching up from a puddle . he pounds against it but it does nt give , it just keeps squeezing . i start running towards him , but the puddle feels like mud , and i almost fall as my feet are trapped . i reach down , and pound against the water but only get my fist trapped too . han sees what has happened too late , he puts one foot in the water , tries to pull the other back , and falls flat on his face . he s held fast , unable to even thrash . and there was no sound , the only sound in the keep is bannon s screams as he struggles with the tendril trying to suffocate him . i twist my neck to look at sister , or the thing that was my sister . she is watching , but not impassively . there s a small glint in the corner of one of her eyes . like a single tear . maybe there s still some bit of lydia in there . maybe ... newline newline i stop looking at the world , and start looking at the precursor . i see the owner , and it s everywhere . the main body is in the center of the room , and tendrils stretch into the water pools , animating them . i saw an octopus once , a small one brought in by a trader , and that s what this reminds me of . a bunch of tentacles and a body . but only one body . i look over at lydia , and gasp , the young woman i had thought of as my sister is still there . just ... changed . she stands at the center of a web of precursor , and i can see her soul . it s not a human soul , not anymore , but it s not an owner either . it s something else . newline newline straining myself , i reach out towards her . it s further than i ve reached before while sparring with han and bannon , but not too much further . i reach , reach , reach ... and make contact . i do nt know how to push a thought , but i do nt need to . i ve got her attention , so she hears me call . newline newline  help us !  newline newline and she responds . she reaches down , behind one of the legs of an arch , and pulls out a sword . she throws it to me . newline newline  help yourself .  newline newline i do nt know how i m supposed to fight an owner using a sword , but i do nt know the metal . i catch it with my free hand and it feels lighter than i would expect , maybe it can hurt them somehow ? with nothing to lose , i swing it at the water that holds me . the owner shrieks . newline newline it s not a shriek like that of a bird diving in for the kill . it s not the shriek of a sheep in pain . it s a single sound , unwavering and without character . but it manages to convey pain nevertheless . the owner pulls back its wounded tentacle , and i can move again . i rush towards it , swinging the sword wildly , but there are more and more tentacles . before i ve gone halfway , i find myself driven back . the owner was playing with us before , now it s mad . the tentacles are sharpened , seeking my mind . if it catches me it will tear my soul out of my body so it can spend more time torturing it . i find myself backing away , but before i reach the puddle i was trapped in , i feel a hand on my shoulder . newline newline  newline newline continued in reply ... newline newlinea young woman lay on a bed , eyes closed but not really closed . to the family surrounding her , she was asleep  her husband sat with a hand in hers , face haggard . newline newline a young boy lay curled up next to her , nestled in close and making the hospital gown on her rustle every time he shifted . he had refused to leave . newline newline marie looked asleep to them , but her other eyes were on him . they had been chatting a fair while now . newline newline  i am the oldest god .  newline newline she had asked him if he was god . to her , he looked like a tall , middleaged man with silver streaks in his otherwise dark hair . he wore plainclothes . newline newline  i am also the simplest of them all .  newline newline  the story i want to tell you , marie , harkens back to my first days . by the time i m finished i ll give you a choice i offer once or twice every few generations .  newline newline       newline newline i knew from the moment of my birth , that i was not like my parents . my eyes first opened to soot and blackness , and a guttering , spitting orangeyellow light . i knew i was something new , and i could feel brothers and sisters like myself waking for the first time as well . it is one of my strongest memories . newline newline in short order it was clear to me that my creators could sense me , but chose to shut me out from their sight . it was part of my being . they had no choice but to make me from their fears and new emotions and feelings . what i m talking about is cave men . i realized i was the first god . they always looked to me first , out of fear . newline newline of course as soon as i realized that , i felt hungry , and driven . i was compelled , bidden  to be wherever death must be . but only for them . cave men . it was nt as if the animals had created me . it was this peculiar creature , caveman . newline newline at first i was sloppy . i was in many places at once , but in each place individually too . each woman or man dying for whatever reason  i did nt care , i did nt know how to care  was but a compulsion to reap . i would look into their eyes and take whatever it was they had collectively used to create me . it did nt give me power . what it did give me was satisfaction . like a job well done . i was real , and i knew it every time i reaped . i had to feel real . this was , for me , life . newline newline at first i did not interact with my fellow gods . i was the strongest , the oldest , but the most aloof . i felt when the others first reached out to one another . i felt them watching me . i never had to drive them off  they never approached me . it was an unspoken rule that i stood alone . newline newline as generations passed and we began to understand the world around us , and understand our creators , we assumed our mantles with a more regal posture . well , they did . i was more sensible with my duties . they played , i worked . i was above them and always would be . newline newline after all , it was nt long before i would come for a god or two individually , as our progenitors grew in their capacity for imagination . gods could die , now , apparently . there were few constants in their imaginations and world , but i was one of them . even the immortality they imagined , was always brought low by death . newline newline i began to feel myself changing , subtly . my birth moment began to feel primal , compared to the more complex thoughts that my creators were assigning me . i was allowed to be ... compassionate , ironic , playful and sinister . i would employ these over time . newline newline until the cave men began to disappear . when i was born there were many , but it was not long before they either began to change or simply gave way to another kind of man . i was afraid that this meant i too would give over to other gods . many of the others already had , while other , foreign gods joined the world pantheon behind me , not made by the cave men . i wondered if they would be different , and maybe spend time with me . newline newline alas , it seemed the same rules that bound me and mine also bound the lines between the foreign , new gods of men from me . newline newline i was created by cave men . but the minds of modern  men respected my authority , my reign . they adopted me easily . i felt freer , too , from the bounds of my compulsion to reap . i occasionally let someone slip me by for a handful of years , just to test my tolerance for it . it was a game i would play every now and then . i d always win . newline newline i ve watched my progenitors fade , and i ve dutifully minded my existence for my adoptive family , you humans . you have killed , and been killed , and savaged and been savage . more so than the cave men . you ve given me work for many life times . i ve never asked for anything , ever . except i began to ask , each of the ones i d let slip me by a few years , if they d play a game with me . newline newline a little test . a challenge . newline newline the first i asked , if he would maybe live a little longer . well , he does nt remember me asking . your minds are so fragile , so fearful of me like the cave men . you contrive little stories after we ve talked , to make sense of it all so you do nt break down . newline newline anyway , he agreed , that one . he was from a village on the shore of a sea and a great desert . he lived a while longer , a fair while actually  but in the end his mind broke and he remembered me , and he begged for me to visit him . newline newline and so it is , every time . you give in to me . just as you created me , you obey my existence , my task . newline newline       newline newline  so , marie , would you like to accept my challenge ?  newline newline the woman tried to sit up , but realized that was silly . she was nt really awake . or was she ? she wondered . newline newline  do i have a choice ?  newline newline death smiled at her in a friendly way . he meant it to be comforting . newline newline  of course you do . many of your kind believe one or other of us gods gave you the free capacity for choice . i do nt know anything about that , just that i m not going to force you to accept my offer . but you should know . you will die tonight if you do not .  newline newline she wrinkled her nose , at least she thought she did . death smiled at her and it gave her chills right through and through her . newline newline  that s not much of a choice , now is it ?  newline newline death sighed . newline newline  i did nt mean it like that . it s not a threat or anything . statement of fact , pure and simple . i would reap you tonight , soon , if you opt out . and for the record , i do nt actually do anything . dying is dying . i ca nt defy nature .  newline newline marie , the mother of the little boy nestled against her body and wife to the husband so fearful of her leaving him with a young boy and empty bed , laughed . newline newline  you re not making any sense . if you do nt actually do anything , then how can you offer me a chance to avoid dying .  newline newline death nodded cheerily . newline newline  aah , you are a bright one . well , who am i , marie ?  newline newline  you say you re death .  newline newline  can death die , marie ?  newline newline  well , i imagine not ...  newline newline  i ll walk with you a while , as long as you want . i ll be elsewhere too , but i ll live with you . really live . i ca nt stop you from dying , but i can walk with you as long as you want .  newline newline her mouth opened a little , and a little sound came out . she looked like she was thinking intensely . newline newline death s mouth twisted to the side , pondering her expression and wondering how long he d have to wait for her reply .i had it all . i would stop time when i needed to sleep , or in a exam to find the right answer , or stealing from people at any given time . newline newline when i met her , i hid the watch away . i did nt need it . i wanted to spend my time with her . newline newline today we are getting married . i threw my watch away . her eyes could nt look at me and i m terrible at placing people or doing pretend voices like i m a priest , but it was the best wedding i could have dreamed of . i do nt think we can have babies but i do nt want them . i want my eternity alone with her . newline newlinei leaned against my axe , placing my elbow on the bottom of the hilt while looking at the ledger for today . it had ten trees listed on it with their name , position , and a basic description of their build . recently we  ve been given withered and broken trees to harvest , given the outrage that spawned from too many young and fit trees being taken down .  you  re killing our youth !  and  can  t you find a better way ?  were thrown around by the locals to my company , but our hands were tied . the government recently passed a law that nuclear and coal power were unsafe for the public  one that was initially backed by the populous i might add  . solar and hydro power wasn  t going to power the evergrowing economy , so we had to revert to burning wood to get energy . newline newline this would have been fine if it wasn  t for the trees being connected to people . no , not in a spiritual way , more of a physical way . you see , when a tree gets hurt , someone in the world gets hurt the same . nobody knows when it started  cause it took a while to make the connection . trees and people ? if you told me they were connected ten years ago i would have laughed in your face . now it  s just another part of my day . newline newline nobody likes being the harbinger of death , so the job of a lumberjack quickly fell past  i don  t really want to do that  to  please anything but that !  the government had to instate a draft to get people to actually harvest trees cause the lumberjack employment rate was so low . that  s where i come in , jus  finishing up my last month of my contract , then i can go back to my old job , a line chef . it wasn  t the most glamorous , no , but at least it wasn  t killin  people or nothin  . newline i walked up to the first tree on the list and took out one of my company issued syringes . the syringe took about 20 seconds to fill up with the narcotic , and once i matched the liquid up to the right level for the size of the tree , i shoved it in the base of the trunk . i  m not sure what happens exactly to the person connected to the tree , but i  m told it makes the act of harvesting a bit less painful . after waiting about 30 more seconds i began chopping down the tree . newline newline this tree in particular was larger than the nearby trees , with branches that extended proudly in all directions . it probably belonged to a young athlete , a shame it was on the list to be chopped down . it gets easier after the first couple trees , it really does . once you forget the fact that there  s a person on the other end of what you  re cutting down it  s not so bad . sometimes i like to make it easier to forget the travesty by singing aloud to myself . if i can sing loud enough i can ignore the screams of those i cut down earlier in my head . newline newline  eight trees down , two to go ,  i thought to myself . syringe out , drugs in , and wait . i was getting a little tired while waiting , probably  cause of the last couple trees were thicker than usual . i thought i had a light cold the last couple days , that wouldn  t help much . i leaned against my axe , placing most of my weight against it now , feeling heavier than usual , and looked up at the tree . i didn  t notice it before but this tree seemed more beautiful than the others . it looked comfortable , like something i could live on if i built a treehouse for it . the leaves turned towards me , and if i were a lesser man i might think the tree was tryin  to talk to me . trees can  t talk , that  s ridiculous . i hefted up my axe and swung directly at the base of the tree . with each swing it became more difficult to recover , i might have to skip my last tree today and head home early , hopefully my boss would understand . by the end of the harvesting session i could hardly stand , but i was almost done , and determined to get at least nine out of my ten tree quota . with a deep breath i heaved against the tree . newlineit was another cold day .  what is it , girl ? what have you found ?  the young golden had been digging again and brought another present for master . she sat there grinning , tail wagging . john crouched down to inspect the catch and was greeted by a low growl .  easy girl . what you got there .  newline newline  another bird ?  came a voice from the kitchen . newline newline  nah man , no blood ... or feathers .  john reached down carefully for the object in her maw newline his sudden grasp sent the dog into a frenzy of growls as the game ensued .  no girl ! drop it ... drop it !  she finally released her prize , yet still grinned . an old cloth wrapped tightly with coiled twine , wet with dew and drool . it cut easily by his knife and spun away leaving limp cloth . newline newline jake had come to witness the unwrapping .  did she finally get one of the neighbors cats ?  newline newline  it s not a cat . its ... what in the hell ?  newline newline a key . large and ornate , it had an elaborate  j.h .  engraved on the side . beneath it was an old parchment map .  this is our town  said jake , studying the map . he laid a pudgy finger on the x  .  that s the old factory.   there .  newline newline  the factory ?  john knew where this was going .  that s been shut down for years . too many accidents . anyway , how would an key from an abandoned factory end up here , a full ten miles away ?  newline newline jake got that smile he always got when up to no good .  why do nt we go find out ? doran stood gazing out the window at immense plains sweeping outwards from his position , running unbroken towards a horizon fifty thousand miles away in a lush , emerald green of tall grasses waving in the wind . even after being born and raised here on neptune , this view still had the power to take his breath away . newline an 18thgeneration descendant of original neptune settlers , doran s upbringing instilled in him a strong allegiance to both family and to the standards which upheld the society which they lived in . newline newline except that lately , say in the last hundred years , a small but growing segment of the population was already rebelling against the very principles which had assured their settler forebears first sustainability , then stability , which strengthened into abundance , confidence and security . and as that surplus deepened and enabled the taming and colonization of vast areas of land , the people built cities , albeit far cleaner than their ancient earthbound versions . newline newline that was all well and good ... but it seems that when we finally left earth , bedraggled and battleweary , the seeds of rome came with us , a malignant instinct in our very blood , that no amount of scrutiny or passion could ever displace . doran had excelled in school , and then later in college , he had shown a keen interest in terran studies , fascinated by the motley assortment of peoples and nations on earth , of competing interests and the bloodsoaked battles to gain prominence . newline newline he remembered one particular holoset which held an interview of one of the original settlers to neptune so long ago . the man s name was dave green , a used car salesman from omaha , nebraska . he told of how close we had come to missing our chance to escape ... of the population being whittled down viciously to less than one billion worldwide ... of the massive furnaces which had been built to incinerate the dead , their ashes unceremoniously dumped into the deepest abandoned mine shafts available . newline newline doran recalled how holloweyed the man had been , recounting the horrors of latterday earth in a deadpan voice that had been burned clean of all emotion or zeal . he once figured , as did his friends , that the majority of settlers had been joyous , vibrant pioneers staking a claim on a new world as a matter of both providence and right ... newline and those individuals did make up a full third of the people who journeyed here ... but the others , while they had the relief of escaping earth and its torments , were irrevocably damaged from the harshness of their existence . still , it was those people who contributed more to the establishment of the laws and traditions which built a foundation for their descendants to thrive upon , than did the raucously exuberant folks . newline newline and now ? doran mused . now there were gigantic industrial zones , the largest of which sprawled over an area of a thousand square miles , fed by an openpit coal mine the size of north america . forward teams have already been sent to both saturn and uranus to launch new power centers such as we have here , with plans to develop the staggering energy of jupiter s wind storms already in the testing stage . newline and the money being made by such assets is nearly beyond calculation . newline as doran turned from the windows and walked back to his office , the words of that longdeceased man from omaha rang in his mind , haunting him still : newline newline   we were taught in school that the statue of liberty was once a beacon to the entire world , a visual symbol of the hope that a place of true freedom existed ... a place where one could thrive apart from tyranny and condemnation ... where a person could achieve their dreams . only , in the end , we ironically became slaves to our selfserving dreams , and lost the very freedoms we had laid down our lives to purchase ...   newlinei walked in the door . it had been a hard day of work , my boss had berated me for spending too much time on reddit and given me an extra report to write . newline newline i glanced to my left , kay was doing dishes . steam rose from the sink , the sounds of dishes clinking and water spashing made me feel just a touch guily . i never did the dishes . newline newline  hey ! how was work ?  she asked , in her always happy voice . she was always full of fun and joy , she could make you smile at your mothers funeral . newline newline  bad .  newline newline  why ?  newline newline i responded with a half hearted grunt and flopped on the couch . newline newline  you know , my sister runs an office near here , maybe i could get you a spot ?  newline newline i responded with a shrug and walked into my room . the lights were off , i liked it that way . newline newline she knocked politely for a second , entering my room and turning on the light . i hissed like the pale skinned vampire i was . newline newline  everything will be okay .  she said . newline newline                            newline newline after class that day i walked into my office . newline newline janice at the front desk stopped me for a second . newline newline  i should probably tell you that dave is nt here today .  newline newline dave , my boss , took a week off every few months , leaving us with a little less work than usual . newline newline  anything he left me to do ?  newline newline  nah , i think he took a sick day or slept in . funny , he s not answering .  newline newline redditing that s day required little stealth . i clicked around , quietly humming various songs that faded into others . dave never showed , and dave never called . lucky bastard , i d be fired if i pulled that . newline newline                   newline newline when i walked in , kay was doing dishes . she lifted red stained knives out of a stack and rinsed them off , humming a song that was slightly off key . red stained the cutting board . newline newline  hey ! i m making beet soup tonight !  newline newline  always the fun one , i see you have beet juice on the walls ! and the ceiling !  i said , grinning . she grinned wider at this and her eyes twinkled . newline newline  good day at work ?  newline newline  you mean good day at reddit ?  newline newline  yah .  newline newline i loved the coppery smell of her beet soup . she made it every few months , it tasted better than any other soup i d ever tasted . newline newline                     newline newline beet juice stains everything brown if you do nt clean it , so i wiped it up with a bleach covered sponge . kay taught me that . it comes out of carpets with peroxide . by the time i finished wiping it up  she cooks , i clean  the soup was already done , in all its steaming carmine glory . i slurped it , enjoying every second . her cooking never needed extra salt . newline newline  do you like it ?  she asked , her head tilted slightly . newline newline  why do nt you make this every day ?  newline newline  ... beet soup takes a lot of work ... .  she said , smiling . newline newline  anyway , do you mind putting it away ? i have to go drop some stuff off .  she continued . newline newline  okay , but where ?  newline newline  in the fridge !  she said , and the door clicked behind her . newline newline                                  newline newline two weeks later , and dave had nt showed up to work . he had nt called either , he did nt answer the door . he probably was on his monthly vacation to florida . i hope he got eaten by a snake . newline newline                         newline newline  ... upon further inspection , a tree in his yard was found to have the letters m and k carved into the trunk . eight other people have disappeared in similar circumstances this year alone . this is seth rodgers , and   the channel was changed by kay . she hated the news , boring , she said . but today she wore a proud smile . newline newline  someone looks happy !  i said newline newline  hmm.. ? oh , yeah , i am ! today i got an a on an exam !  newline newline  great !  i said . newline newline she calls herself kay but it s short for macairia knight . mk . and her semester ended yesterday . newline newline                    newline newline today was my day off . not officially , but my new boss , may , let us off early if our work was done . today , i had nothing to do , and when i called she just said something like  less people stealing my coffee  . that was her way of showing love . as i awoke , i heard kay walking in . i starred at the doorway . she walked in , covered in blood . newline newline headtotoe , crimson . she stared at me , just for a broken second , like a deer in the headlights . now she was smiling , was it just my imagination ? newline newline  today i got a job at the slaughterhouse down the road . i quit .  she said . she never quits . newline newline  strangely , you re covered in blood .  newline newline  yes . soup night ?  newline newline  hell yeah !  i think i m conditioned to forget anger at those words . because i did . newline newline she washed up , changed clothes .  got ta go pick up some ingredients !  she said . newline newline when she left for the store , she never came back . newline newline police found the letters mk freshly carved into a tree outside . newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline newline go back to sleep  , she said while rolling over . i stared up at the blank ceiling as a rush came over my thoughts . i started to panic but paralyzed with fear . newline newline if i move , it may cause something to happen , but if i don  t move , nothing will happen . right ? the ink which was slowly presenting itself on my right forearm was the sign of a killer . those who have killed someone , their name appears , slowly , on their dominate arm . although the name hadn  t appeared yet , my mind was rapidly going through today  s events . nothing seemed out of the ordinary . i look over and see the blotchy red area of arm . that same background tone i have seen so many times on the news and internet sites . i haven  t seen the mark in person . newline newline a black letter  t  begins to form . complete confusion overwhelms my mind before pure horror comes to my mind . tess , my girlfriend , who lies right next to me . it couldn  t be her , she just spoke to me . absolute fear as i quietly roll over to check . an  e  appears next to the now darkened  t  . i violently shake her awake . in a confusing muffled voice she responds ,  what in the world roger ! ?  a brief moment of relief momentarily crosses my mind as she is still alive . still looking at me in complete confusion , i glance down at my arm to now see the  e  completely darkened and an  s  forming next to it . she sees my marking , my tag . newline newline i watch as her eyes put together the puzzle . it is then i notice something not right in her eyes . her eyes seemed glazed over . i don  t recall them being so hazy when i first awoke her . it was then she slowly collapsed back into the bed . scrambling to my feet , i call the police and begin to awake her again . this time there was no response . i don  t understand how this could all happen so quickly . i look back at my arm and see the darkened  s  has taken its place and a second  s  has slowly started emerge . newline newline in my pure panic , i hear the operator ask for the address . quickly spurting out our quiet apartment  s location , i try to awaken her again . the operated gave repeated pleas to stay calm but they simply fell on deaf ears . i didn  t even do anything . i sat next to her as now her name fully appeared on my arm . the blood soaked red background with diseasedblack lettering spelled her name . newline newline a loud knock hammered at the door awoke me out of my stupor . upon opening the door , two paramedics quickly shove me out of the way while two police officers look at me and then down at my arm .  sir , may i ask what happened tonight ?  newlineit started with the scent of sandalwood . it seeped into my mind , a fragment from my previous existence , mixing in with the stench of iron and entrails i feasted upon . the return of a memory , and not the last . newline newline months later i was cracking the skull of a young mother when i realized that two things had returned to me : the humanity of others and the concept of time . had it really been a month ? where did such a belief come from ? newline newline something whimpered in the corner of the room . the room ? yes , a child s bedroom . a little boy s bedroom , complete with a cowering little boy staring transfixed at his mother s corpse . i considered him , in all his fear and anguish . i lunged with as much strength as this body gave me , ending his life with a single bite through the windpipe . i believe this was my first encounter with mercy . newline newline newline that is how i reaquanted myself with humanity . i encountered it in every piece of torn flesh and grinding bone . it s a paradox i find worthy of my time . i remind myself that this is a mercy to the living . i crave flesh because i crave old memories , and i crave to form new ones . but this takes time , and time is an unforgiving companion . i wait for memories with every bite . newline newline a green dress , a starched lab coat . the clip of heels on linoleum . the fading sound of party music down the hall . she came back to me like this . i did nt realize i was following the memory of her until i stood outside her house . a small roadside home outside the city , a simple brick house with a shuttered windows and no signs of life . and yet it beckoned to me , more tantalizing than marrow and spinal fluid . newline newline i walked in , disregarding the simple furniture and the blood soaked carpets . they were nothing new . i gravitated toward the pictures on the mantle , and the memory of sandalwood . no , not the memory , the scent itself . and there i found her . a darkhaired woman in a green dress , staring out of the frame . in life , she had traded in the dress and the dancing for a labcoat and a chance at holding lives under her scalpel . she never would have guessed , seeing me now , that dying would be such fruitful research . i took the picture into my hand and made myself stand in front of the full length mirror by the closet . i had to know . i looked at myself , a ghastly creature with the same dark hair . the woman in the picture had never really left home . i was a decaying body housing a lively mind , and surely the more i fed , the more whole i would become . the brain is , after all , still flesh . newline newline i do not miss the woman i was . she is trapped inside her sandalwood frame whereas i am coming into my own . i am the product of old memories with new context . i am the scientist and the test subject . i have outgrown the living . gluttony is a sin john  the nefarious jigsaws voice crackled over the tv screen ,  you have taken people for granted your whole life  . jigsaws unwavering tone continued as he recited another boring monologue .  today we are going to cut down on some of this excess baggage john  . john sat sullen , tied to a chair , his movements restricted and a remote gripped in his hand . light pierced his eyes as the room lit up and he let out a gasp of mild pain . in front of him sat both his brother and sister , their eyes wide and terrified . they were similarly incapacitated with the exception of being gagged and wires running up around their bodies , dug into their flesh .  your dear siblings are one click of that remote in your hand away from electrocution , the button on the left kills your brother , on the right your sister , you have five minutes to decide or they both die  . both of johns siblings jerked and strained in their chains , desperate to escape , they shook their heads side to side and their eyes pleaded desperately from life . john stared back at his two siblings , their lives held so delicately in his hand . he reminisced on the lives they had lived together , the stories they shared , the bond of love they had formed . he then dropped the remote . it bounced on the hard concrete before landing face upwards .  oh no ! i seem to have dropped the remote  john exclaimed sarcastically ,  however will i save either my poor brother or sister now ?  his flamboyant pitch of voice echoed around the room .  you have doomed your siblings to both die john  jigsaw replied , his voice no longer unwavering and now uncertain .  oh well what can you do ? john said remorselessly  no point worrying about what can  t be helped  he continued , apparently unconcerned with his sibling  s terrible fate .  i heard when people burn to death they smell like bacon  i guess i  m about to find out though  he pondered , unempathetic .  the fuck is wrong with you  jigsaw chastised , clearly disturbed by this point .  don  t worry i  m fine , just curious is all  john returned , before descending into a slight chuckle which then escalated into an uncontrollable fit of laughter as his dear sweet brother and sister devolved into spasmic fits , their bodies filled with electricity .  just a little curious  john once again repeated through his fit of laughter before screwing his face up in disgust .  no that doesn  t smell very good at all i suppose  he finished as he good a whiff of his siblings soiled remains .june 9th , 1939 newline newline hey ma , newline newline i finally found some time to write you . i m sorry i

newline newline  oh . smile widest when it hurts the most ?  newline newline  a little creepy if you ask me .  the anesthesiologist replied , flooding the patient with nitrous . newline newline the patient s eyes drooped , then shot open and he shouted ,  the glass is half lemonade ! every trial is a blessing at the end of the tunnel ! silver lining !  his eyes drifted shut and he muttered quietly  what does nt kill me makes me stronger .  newline newline  yeah he s not going to make it . i m 6 feet tall , to the smallest measurable fraction of an inch . i have built and conditioned my body to the peak of physical ability , and maintained it ever since i was sparta , learning the brutal art of pankration . i will say with some pride that even their kings considered me gifted . newline newline i have roamed through these milennia in strange circles . once you ve crossed the threshold of centuries of life , there are few circles open to you that are not strange . for many , many years i wondered at my undying nature . at long last , i learned that i have the nature of a mage . a strange one , to be certain , but a mage none the less . newline newline most wizards do nt fear a mage . a mage only has skill in one arena . conjurers , evokers , seers , all onetrick ponies . they re dangerous , certainly , but easily countered . a wizard can do all of these . and they know to fear this mage . newline newline i am , as far as it is known , the only mage of silencing . magical workings fail at the simplest exertion of my will . at a whim , the mightiest practitioner is simply a man . usually a man of average or less physical ability . newline newline as i ve said , pankration is a brutal art .beneath my feet , the gravel of the cavern floor crunched loudly . listening to the echo , i could only barely sense the size of the room . it felt massive , and straining to see in the darkness , i wondered as to which direction the exit may lay . newline newline days had already passed , since i had left cerulean to chase my dreams , with only staryu by my side . lost and alone , without food or water , we had wandered  floor by floor , until we had to have searched the entire cave . after the second day , staryu fainted , dehydrated without a source of water . placing it back within its pokeball , i continued , starving , but determined . newline newline and my determination had led me here , to this possibly immense room , which i noticed felt slightly warmer . the air itself even felt.. heavier  surely there had to be an opening , an exit here , to the outside world ! wondering about blindly , i found myself against a cold and smooth wall , which i followed , guiding myself along until suddenly underfoot i felt  soil !  undeniably , soft , moist soil ! this was my chance , we were saved , or so i believed as i took off towards the direction of the soft ground . newline newline to my dismay however , i felt myself listing on my third step , my running shoes coming unstuck in what felt like quicksand , and slipping away . even as i tried desperately to turn back i felt my body heaving forward  with hands outstretched , i fell into the sludge blindly as my ankles became caught in the muck . above me then i heard the familiar cries , shrill and ear piercing  and i realized my fatal mistake too late . newline newline slowly i began sinking further and further into the warm , putrid substance  so thick that it swallowed my limbs , turning them completely useless . as the earth slowly ate me , i cried not for me , but for staryu , trapped eternally within its pokeball.. newline newline ..and with a final gasping sob , i died , breathing deep the soft guano of zubat , slowly but surely , drowning on the poisonous substance . newline newlinei heard the car door slam while sitting in my living room . i was reading the newspaper , or a book , or listening to the radio  i do nt really remember much of that day . newline newline i did nt need to turn around to know what they were doing here . something about the way the door closed  something about the way the air smelled  something about the way their stiff rubber shoes stomped up my gravel driveway that my husband and i had always intended to pave over . i wanted to run away from them and towards them at the same time  on the one hand to avoid what i already knew , and on the other to finally let go of the guilt and worry i d been carrying for almost three years . instead i froze , like an idiot , and felt a coldness creep from my fingers to my chest . my heart slowed down but became a million times louder , painfully pushing against my ribs . newline newline they arrived at the first step simultaneously . they had practised their walking . they ve done this exact thing before and they ll do it again and it ll never get any easier and they will always stop at the first step , just like anyone would . the entire house seemed to inhale as a breeze rolled through the window and just held it . i found i was holding my breath too , hoping for nothing to change , but betrayed by my visibly pulsating stomach and clenched fists digging into my thighs . newline newline finally , as they ascended the first step , the moment was lost . the house exhaled and i rocked myself out of the chair to an unsteady standing position . i knew they would come eventually . every morning i was reminded by a ford pickup in the driveway and every night by the pills that helped me  not sleep exactly , but stop thinking for a few hours . newline newline third step . i had to prepare myself . the one thing they hated most of all was when you cried . i was nt going to do that . i would be strong and look them in the eyes as i died . as my heart stopped i would stare at them and tell them i do nt blame them . i d forgive them as they walked away and left me alone . newline newline fourth step . i finally recognized i was terrified . i knew what i was getting into when it began but somehow believed i could beat the odds . but a man always dies eventually . to some it just came sooner . the thought was logical , but logic is not comforting . logic is cold , like the corpse of a lover or the metal of a bullet or the dirt of the grave . newline newline fifth step . i finally breathed in again . a sharp , quick , sorrowful gasp . i was on the verge of sobbing but i could nt disgrace myself like that . i quickly reached for the nearest cloth and blew my nose and wiped my eyes . the handknitted throw pillow cover would have to dry cleaned but  4 does nt matter , has nt ever mattered . no one ever cried over  4 , and i was nt going to start . newline newline final step . they were at the door . a hand raised and paused again in a fist . they were professional . they did not catch you by surprise . it would be quick  it would be painful  but it would be over . newline newline i walked slowly to the door and pulled it open . newline newline  trevor ?  an unknown , unfathomable voice asked . newline newline i simply nodded . newline newline as he handed me the folded flag , i remembered what i had been training myself for every since i married steven . he would die and leave me alone and that was the price for loving him . he would die and leave me standing in the doorframe holding a flag instead of a body . newline newline he died because his training failed him . i died because mine took over . newline newline i did not cry in front of his fellow soldiers , because dead men do not cry .alright kid . newline newline my name is dom . i ve been in hell for 600 years so far . and i m fuckin  loving it . bloody hell . you d be surprised how many historical figures you d find here . in school we were all taught that these fancy pants tossers never did anything wrong . but fuck me they re the worst of the lot . king louie retells his stories of the sex orgies he d have in his massive castles . women and drink at the click of a finger . then you have all the pirates . they re tons of fun . go at each other with swords all day . newline newline see the thing with hell is that once satan realises you dont care anymore , you can fuck off . no point torturing someone who doesnt care . nobody older than 250 still lives in the shitty part . rest of us do what we want really . newline newline then you have the posh pricks in heaven . bellends ! ! ! holy fuck they are twats . they come down with god sometimes to look down on us and genuinly all i ve ever seen them do is compete to see who s lasted the longest without having a wank and apologising to daddy for being fucking born ! ! ! its mental . being gay is a sin in the bible yet they have their massive fucking heads stuck up their own arses so far their rims now have the same mathematical circumference of them sun . newline newline trust me kid , you wan na be here in hell . we re the good guys .hey everyone . i ve written this story some time ago , and would love some feedback ! i m striving to improve , and any constructive criticism would be a great help . thanks ! newline newline   newline newline they say everyone s story is different . unique . i shall say this with confidence  if you tell as many tales as there are grains of sand , at no point shall one have the smallest sense of familiarity to my own . now , it would be very much to my pleasure if you could lend me an ear or two . let us sit here eternally , you listening and me telling tales . it would make me a very happy man . newline newline if my memories serve me right , a tale should always begin with the setting  the place where the story takes hold . give me a moment , there had been far too many years between now and the time of this tale . i wonder how long it had actually been . was it five , ten or maybe twenty ? i m truly sorry , but it s hard to keep track of this tangible substance time  if you ve been wandering the earth as a lost soul for as long as i have . newline newline no , i guess wandering is nt the most accurate term , is it ? i wonder if there exists a single word to describe what i ve been through . traumatic , maybe . but i ve grown past that phase , so maybe the word best fit now would be apathy ? it s hard to keep your world from turning black and white when you ve so freely seen what most would only dream of . i ve muddled through the lushes of forests and dove into the depths of the great seas . i ve discovered animals yet to be named , and some that never will . human civilization had caused the death of a great many things , and i ve been a bystander during all the great wars that scarred this earth . newline newline but it s not all bad . i ve watched many great people get born , and trailed behind them during their early childhood . while i do grow bored eventually , it s quite a nice little surprise to check back on them after a few decades and discover that they ll be one of those men and women that goes down in history . i ve watched the creation of man s greatest inventions  even man s greatest discoveries . i ve attended many weddings , sitting in a corner as a silent spectator . newline newline now ? well , now i m here talking to you . in all my years , i ve never truly taken the time to appreciate kids and children . while they did have an uncanny ability to sense my presence , you never cried or threw tantrums . more so , it seems that for some reason you re able to see me . i do wonder how i look , and the memory of my appearance was one of the first things to slip from my mind . ghosts do nt appear in mirrors , so it was nt like i could ever check up on myself . and while i did have the pleasure of watching your crayon drawings of me , there s really nothing much to appreciate regarding your artistic talent . newline newline   newline a young boy in lightgreen pajamas sits on his bed . a bedside lamp softly illuminates the room as the stars outside shine with their twinkling glow . the boy could often be seen nodding and smiling to nobody in particular , and his parents chalked it up to him talking to an imaginary friend . and while they normally paid no heed to his quirks , it s time for him to sleep . footsteps sounded outside his door , and his mother walked into the room . newline newline  it s time to sleep , sweetie . say goodnight to your little friend and let s get you tucked in.  she says , her voice as gentle as an angel s . the child s expression turned into a gleeful smile as he laid his head down against his pillow , wearing that expression of happiness that children seem to be blessed with .  do you want me to turn the light off ?  asked his mother , pulling the blanket over him . the boy shook his head and closed his eyes . he felt a loving peck of lips against his forehead , and soon drifted off into the world of merry dreams . newline newline  i do nt think my friend likes the dark  he thought .  the dark s scary , and he would nt like scary stuff . a woman with blue earrings stands in the doorway of an unfamiliar room . the unfamiliar room has some things in it that look like mine , things i

newline newline a woman with flashing red earrings is standing just in front of me . she s an older woman . how did she get so old ? she has beautiful eyes . i want to kiss her .  who are you ?  i ask .  you re beautiful .  newline newline a woman with fine yellow earrings is leaning over . she smells wonderful , she smells like casablanca , home cooking , childbirth , dancing , rain , and tears . i would give anything to know what that smell is . newline newline there s a woman with blue earrings standing over me . she puts her hand on my shoulder and whispers in my ear . her voice is like an unnamed constellation in a starless sky .  hello darling , it s me , miranda , your wife . every week , mark receives an email about doing mundane but very specific stuff . it s spam is what he argued so he never payed attention to them . sometimes it asks him to share a certain video , sometimes it asks for a purchase on a certain gadget . one time it got really weird when it asked him to say hello to his neighbors , the andersons . he did nt even have neighbors of that name . newline newline the problem was a new family just moved in . when he went to welcome them to the neighborhood , they introduced themselves as the andersons . that s when it got really weird . when he opened the next email , another message came in from his bank . somebody deposited a small amount of money to him . newline newline he did nt know what to think so he tested it . then again , and then again . with each accomplished task , he received money on the next email . one thing he noticed though is this : the content of the messages were getting harder and the money was getting larger . for greeting the anderson s , he got a dollar and 55 cents . for inviting his coworker to dinner , he received 15 dollars . newline newline on the next messages , the orders were less specific but on these times , the subjects of the email read : be discrete . and so he solved all the minor details and got compensated , handsomely . to give his coworker a new pair of shoes , he arranged a secret santa and rigged the drawing . to make his friend stay in with his family for a weekend , he  accidentally  dropped a can of tuna on his friend s toe . newline newline as time went pass , the tasks became heavier in both difficulty and impact while his plans got more convoluted with each order . some asked him to cause a huge pileup in nearby interstate  he solved that by inviting a truck driver for a  couple  of drinks before his morning shift . to prevent an oil tanker from sinking in a nearby beach , he exploited a loophole in the company s standard operating procedure to have the tanker deliver elsewhere . all this time making hundreds to thousands of dollars with each mission . newline newline

everyone who s posted , great stuff . i like how some people have interpreted the number as a great thing and yet there s an understanding that some people can see it as an awful thing . newline newline i was in second term freshman year when they started . at first , a class would only have one or two . occasionally you d even get a few appearing mid class . some people would  ooh  and  aww  as the light shimmered into existence . as the numbers began to appear , people noticed that the better your gpa , the brighter the light . it was simple as that . simple . that s what school was like , before the markers . the worst part was that you could nt even do anything about the number . chuckles hell , some kids even tried covering them up with hats at first but to no avail , the number would still glisten regardless of what you tried to cover it with . newline newline first , it was just the 4.0 s . you d get high fives and cheers as they started becoming normal . there d be shrieks coming from various buildings all over campus because friends walking through the doors were delighted see that their friend had been marked last night with a similar score . people let these numbers go to their heads . instead of hiding , some showed them off and walked tall . i remember the first to turn of the group was dennis . fuckin  dennis . i knew the kid was smart but he was never so smug about it before , yknow ? he d constantly talk how he d get random high fives from other 4.0 s in the halls . eventually those random people started getting names and then well , one thing led to the next . the next day he d talk about a party he went to on the weekend and how he got invited to this club and so on and so on and well , to be honest , we do nt see dennis too much these days . newline newline there was beginning to be a lot of them . not the 4.0 s but just the numbers in general . it was nt rare to see a full table of kids with them at lunch time . by this time , the numbers did nt just glow a s . as time went on , the whole damn gradient was being worked down . 3.8 s , 3.7 s , you know the rest . it was nt just on campus either . if you were enrolled in a school , you had a number . alumni even had them . newline newline mom and dad were starting to get on my ass about it . newline newline  yeah , yeah i ll see you later .  i was putting my shoes on when i noticed it .  da..dad.. you re marked ?  i did nt even notice over this morning s breakfast . newline newline chuckles  yup .  he glanced in the mirror .  i was wondering when i d see it .  newline

went up last night , hey ?  my mom replied . she glanced over to me and frowned .  not all the marks though .  newline newline  yeah , jim and i at the office the other day were talking about how dave

? where s yours ?  newline newline i remember fuming the whole bus ride to the train station . sure , i was nt the best student but i tried my hardest . i was the invisible majority at the time . the kids who realized they were beginning to lose friends to the upper elite students . i pretended like i did nt see it , in myself at least . the groups were nt mixed grades anymore . they were being sifted . the larger numbers stayed together and the lower values would fall through . i hated it . i hated what school had become . i thought we were done with this high school clique bull shit . newline newline the day i cried on the train . my bus had arrived at the train station as it always did . i was at the end of the platform as i stared at the on coming train . i saw the luminescence of the numbers adjacent to me , a sea of light and numbers . they highlighted the features of the train and it s passengers as they whizzed by . i saw smiles , and frowns , all of which with their own corresponding number . and as i stared at the train in front of my face , i saw my own . a lone 2.0 began to fade into existence .the kitchen was dark when i entered the house . a flickering glow in the hallway drew me towards it . there on the table , next to a picture of us was a candle and a sealed envelope . newline newline  read as soon as you get home  newline newline her handwriting was

conversation every day for the last three weeks they d only been married seven months but it felt like seven years . most days she could nt believe she had ever married him , and this morning was no

baby shower .  newline newline  alright , alright , fine . let s do this . quietly .  joseph dipped his hand into the gilded vase of oil and rubbed it on his wife s nether regions . he kissed her ,

newline see , the entire freaking system is rigged against people like me . we re all dopey flightless birds stuck on the prosaic sinking ship that is mediocrity , going down in the unforgiving sea of unremarkability . and its not like there s any chance of survival considering well , i do nt even have the ability to swim . i ca nt even feasibly compare myself to an average joe because at least whoever this average joe guy is , people know his name . i am , truly by all accounts , a nobody . and my bank account reflects this lack of anything meaningful . i m telling you , the entire system is a sham . you need skills in order to gain credits , but you need credits in order to gain any meaningful skills . its all a ploy for the government to keep us people , the skillnots , oppressed . anyway , in all honesty , at this point i m basically a mortician since really my only income is from people dying . while others see  your aunt sarah passed away  , all i see are four big fat blue credit symbols . thankfully enough though severe hemophilia runs rampant in my huge family of 84 and counting  luckily for me , down  . like clockwork every month , credits roll in , bringing me back to life like jesus on a sunday . and hey i mean , if they ever stop , at least my suicide note ll double as the weapon . to probably the utter disappointment of my parents , most days i just blow what credits i have on garbage rag root shavings , usually laced with god knows what since i m not really in a position to afford anything remotely quality . yeah my parents were nt the proudest of me , but pride has no worth in the afterlife . they did have my brother to quench their ego s thirst for parental satisfaction . he s some hotshot qeiber ball player , naturally born with the skill , ranking in credits like a god damn vacuum . i love him as far as love goes for someone you randomly just happened to pop out of the same genitalia from , but in this credit economy , my concern for family s life is inversely proportional to the size of their credit account . jackassery aside , i do nt have much to lose , other than my life maybe , but at this point i do nt really know if i d

not wrong ... who cares , its not like i had integrity to begin with . i rummage through the capsules of preloaded skills , and its the basic handmedown crap you d expect in a bin like this . momma always told me  clearance  was another word for  garbage  . not that she actually said that , my parents never really spoke to me in the first place . funny enough they actually put theft detection on these pieces of trash . greedy bastards . is it that necessary to protect these ? are inaudibly whispering and gender studies really that important that anyone would steal them ? among the trivially idiotic skills available , i do manage to scavenge a few quality ones .  writing  is at a complete bargain of a price . i mean , nothing ll ever amount from it , but if it s working maybe i could sell it later or something , who knows . right in the corner of the box however , stuck between two decaying pieces of cardboard , theres this purple capsule with weird designs resembling the bottles of homeopathic medicine my mother would make me take as a child . it was completely nasty when i was younger , and to not relive any memories of that , i chuck the skill capsule right back in the box . i check under the cardboard to see if theres anything else of interest . theres a few cool ones here and there , but i end up narrowing it down to two capsules ,  writing  and  self love  . honestly i do nt know what the hell compels me to pick up that utter nonsense hippie  self love  bullshit , but the capsules the cheapest there  probably for a good reason  and its pretty cool looking with like tie dye designs and this trippy heart , so i consider it . it s late , i really should head home whether i like it or not , so i choose a capsule and rush over to the register . unfortunately the only register open is register three , so again i m greeted by the asshole with the smile . i m trying to just the capsule , transfer over the credit or two it costs , and avoid any further social contact than necessary . but in my attempt to attain social isolationism , of course mr. swap specialist has to pipe up . newline newline  is that all sir ? ... .. would you like a bag ? ... ..i hope you enjoyed ! ... .. sir ? ... .  newline newline newline jesus again , take a hint buddy . i get the hell out as fast as i can , capsule in hand , and as i m leaving he voices his opinion . newline newline newline  come back next week sir ! we ll have a sale on the manners skill .  newline newline yea ok buddy , i ll either be dead or shopping somewhere better by next week , manners my ass . i think about my choice in skill as i make the small trek home . it seems to have rained a bit earlier , and the cobblestone roads are glistening under the moonlight . the clouds have cleared revealing a bright full moon , reigning king over all mortals below . i snap out of my weird internal romanticization of a giant rock in the sky as i get home . i know they say patience is a virtue , however both patience and virtue are vastly out of my credit range . i blow an amass of dust off my skill capsule infuser , pop in my new purchase , and hook up the neural cord from the infuser to the port in the rear of my cerebellum . the infuser was a gift from one of my now passed relatives , not the newest model or the best shape , but it gets the job done . i hope at least . i have nt exactly used it ever . now it was time . i lay back on my sofa , the back of my head hanging over the arms of the couch allowing the cord to run through , flip the switch , and fall into the most refreshing sleep in my entire mortal life . i m sorry , mr. gygax . i just want to get one thing clear . you re telling us that your games actually allow people to be able to cast spells ?  newline newline  of course . it works on the same principle as all other magic . if enough people believe in it strongly enough , it becomes real .  newline newline  so.. santa claus is real ?  newline newline  an invisible entity that rewards good children and punishes bad ones ? of course he exists . there are plenty of children who believe so , and in doing such , make him real . there are also enough adults that do not believe in santa , so that is why you do nt see a jolly fat man in a flying sleigh travel across the countryside . he just works very subtly . a boss suddenly deciding to give out a christmas bonus . a five dollar bill found on the side of the street . people doing nice things simply because of the christmas spirit  . it s all because of santa .  newline newline  would nt the people at home watching this interview strengthen santa just by believing that there is a chance that what you say is truth ?  newline newline  oh , i m hoping for it . santa claus is one of the higher powers who is not a complete jerk . the more people who believe in him , the stronger he gets .  newline newline  and you were saying this is how your games give people the ability to cast spells .  newline newline  of course . sure , there are comparatively far less people playing a session of dungeons and dragons than those who are now trying to believe in santa , but playing my games takes longer . after a few hours , the belief that you can cast magic takes hold in yourself and your gaming group , until you are actually able to cast a tiny version of that spell . but this is just a spark that starts the bonfire . once you and your friends see that your magic casting abilities are real , they will start to believe that much more , resulting in your powers growing , resulting in more belief , and so forth .  newline newline  so there is no calling upon evil or satanic forces ?  newline newline  none whatsoever , sadly for all those paranoid church groups .  newline newline  do you think you could give us a demonstration ?  newline newline  on national television ? i would be delighted to . how about levitation ? it s a fairly low level cantrip .  newline newline  amazing , folks . my chair is lifting up all on its own . i can assure you that there are no wires attached to me or my piece of furniture .  newline newline i turned off the television with a gesture . the cat was now out of the bag . another gesture had my carefully thought out plans burning into ash . no behind the scenes world domination for me and my group . newline newline still a level 6 sorcerer would nt be too bad in the new world , especially once my spell components arrive . we would like to announce that hell is finally empty .  newline newline i paused for a moment , reflecting . it had taken me quite a long time to see this day . there were decades  occasionally , even centuries  that i lost hope that i d ever utter those words . newline newline and there i was , once more peering down from the clouds at my beloved ones . we had agreed some time ago to stop calling out to them until it was over  it confused them too much in the older days . newline newline  i am so , so very proud of you all . this is the kingdom you have built .  newline newline i heard my voice echo through the world as it reached towards everyone that could hear it . when the echos stopped , i closed my eyes and thought of their most beloved city . the wind whipped through my hair , and as i opened them again i was standing miles outside of their great metropolis , on a hill that i had helped create many , many years ago . newline newline they had grown much , and i was so proud of them . it was alright , i decided , to take some time and take it all in . from my thoughts i drew a blanket and a picnic basket . he would come  he had promised me . newline newline i sat and stared at their metropolis . i wondered if i could have come up with something so great , and i was humbled when i realized that it had taken all of us to make it . we were all one , and all of us were one . newline newline it had taken a long time to convince the other that working together was the best way to see the goal achieved  he need nt lock himself up and fret all day , we need nt be adversaries , we need nt fight . no , we could do this together  even though we were nt equals , we still needed each other to succeed . newline newline we came up with the final plan together . we knew that while we could force them to be good that the free will we had given them would end up with them rebelling . it would never take if we forced it on them  they had to come up with it on their own . newline newline we could inspire them , though . we could show them things as they really were . lies and a tailored truth had never worked  i was ashamed that we had tried to pool wool across their eyes . they thought that we were beyond that , that perfect  meant without flaws . newline newline the truth was , perfect  as they thought did nt exists . they were far more perfect than we were in that regard  at least , now they were . newline newline we picked our first prophet , together . we chose a man that did not believe in us , and did not force him to . he was a man of the sciences , a man that had studied psychology just a little . an educator  his name was michael , as were a great many on the planet . newline newline we showed michael hell . the real hell , the true hell . the nightmare that it was . newline newline we came to him in the night , and in the morning he understood it as a vivid dream brought on by his strange mix of desert and drinks that night . newline newline i stood beside him in hell , the torrent that it was . i held his hand when it was too much for him to take in , and helped him pass through it . i showed him an old friend entering hell , and let him see his whole time there . i showed him what it was , what he saw , what his time in hell was . newline newline i asked michael what he thought of what he saw , and was so proud of his answer :  it s beautiful , just , and what helps us all .  newline newline i had my doubts at times about what we created at times , but hearing him agree and understand placed them aside . newline newline when michael awoke he had come to the funny thought on his own   we d all be a lot better off if earth was a lot more like that dream  . newline newline michael was not the one who created the metropolis  he had died twenty seven years ago at the beautiful age of 87 , five years older than his father . it was a beautiful service , paid for by an anonymous man that may have been the other . we both attended , we both hugged the casket . we had said we were students of him  in our own way , it was not a lie . newline newline michael had taught the value of extreme empathy to his students , and in one one of his students a powerful seed had been planted . he had claimed that empathy is why we could gather together , why it was beneficial to us all to work as a group . he looked at empathy as a trait gained in evolution , and taught it as such . newline newline in his inspired student , the seed would later cause him to become a teacher much like michael  he had become a professor of mental therapy , whom had discovered that empathy was a trait not so nurtured in the society as it should be . newline newline in turn , as that student gave a lecture across the world to a university he would never step foot in save that single time , he inspired another student when he said  i think if we all could feel how we made people feel that we would grow in ways we could never expect  . newline newline the seed was planted in that student , whom had only been there by chance  she was attending to take notes for her friend , whom had the flu . she mused how funny it was that feeling bad for her friend had led her to hear about empathy . newline newline two weeks later she was asked to declare her topic of choice  she was an engineer in a time of great engineering marvel . she said that it would be in neural implants , though she did not learn why until twelve years after her degree was finished when she saw that the professor that lectured about empathy had passed away in a tragic car accident  he had been a mildly famous author by that point , enough to make the news for twelve minutes across four days . newline newline as she remembered the lecture , she remembered what he had said about feeling empathy , and in her lab that day began a prototype to share emotion . newline newline it took her three decades to pass clinical trials . it began in couple s therapy to resounding success  feeling how they made partners felt had made every couple succeed . newline newline she was astonished  she had hoped for a drop of increased success , but this was astonishing . newline newline people began to adopt the implants into everyday use . it took many years , but by the time she too had passed the world had already changed dramatically . there were talks of the first great unified city . newline newline a different sort of breeze interrupted my thoughts . besides me sat the other . i poured him some wine  we had yet to speak . newline newline he broke the silence after taking the glass from me . newline newline  to us , to all of us , together . we did it , together .  newline newline i had never seen him cry before , but he cried a little then as he gazed upon the metropolis . newline newline empathy had saved them . one by one humans alive had come to terms with how they made others feel . they felt the joy they gave others , the pain they caused them . they forgave each other , they helped each other , they communed in ways that not even the other predicted . what we had done in hell for all those years had been so easy for them to adopt , to inflict upon themselves , and come out greater than we had predicted . newline newline it had taken many years , but hell had cleared out three weeks ago by human s time . they had rid themselves of their training wheels , of their stumbling through the dark . our blessed little children had ushered in their newest age . newline newline well , that s not entirely fair . we had all ushered it in , together . what does it feel like ,  i asked her ,  to die ?  newline newline her rollicking blue eyes were bolted wide and slick with fright . she didn  t answer , and that wouldn  t do . there musn  t be anything i can  t have , it isn  t the way . and though her lips said nothing , her eyes screamed . to think without them , without those bright , beautiful eyes , we could never have shared in this moment . they called me to her , a lantern in the belly of sweating , undulating bodies , and pulsating lights . newline newline newline the nightclub :  noun  cattle breeding grounds , outfitted in darkness to impede evolution . newline newline newline i never much liked nightclubs unless , that is , i needed livestock . that morning i had woken hungry , and a trip to the farm would be just right . it took no planning , nor coaxing . i  ve been submerged in this particular fancy for , well , as long as i  ve known . it would be a pleasure . newline newline newline the only preparation was waiting  you can  t hurry inspiration , and this sort of affair was most beautiful at night . like a warm , bubbling stew , steeped with the spices of stems , stock , and sinew . when it  s cold , and the day has all but flickered out , the soup trickles down your spine , warming you from the inside in a way it can  t at any other hour . newline newline newline and so i waited , and i fancied , and then i dressed . women care a great deal about dress . newline newline newline not to clean as to be aloof , or too dirty as to be unseen . you must dress ontrend  show you  re capable . give promise that you  re perfect for her , but not too specific as to feel perfect for someone else . newline newline newline i combed my hair in a way that looked as if i hadn  t . be better without effort . newline funny , my whole life has been effort , every day i try . i learn . i choose something new to expand myself into . newline newline newline and yet the women stick like moths in honey , drawn by the golden glow of an effortless veneer built brick by brick of effort . newline newline newline then it was time . i waded into the bodies , into the lights , overcome by the stench of desperation  which smells , oddly , like cheap perfume and expensive cologne  . i gazed over the undeserving heads until i saw something wonderfully blue . newline newline newline it belonged to the girl . she was surrounded by a gaggle of cackling geese , who tittered and fluffed their feathers for passing ganders . newline newline newline but she was different . she was beautiful . a thick tapestry of hair was braided across her head and over one exposed shoulder , glittering like pale amber underneath the garish lights . her lips sat like a ripe plum , tarted with candy apple . her cheeks , oh her cheeks , still plump with promise , not yet starved by age . newline newline newline then , of course , were her eyes . they were the kind of eyes that could bring down walls , raise valleys , tear armies of the deadliest warriors asunder . they were like nothing i  d ever had , which is why they belonged in my hands . she was not old enough to be here , to be sure . even better . if her place wasn  t here , then it was with me . newline newline newline it didn  t take long . i worked my way through the grasping fingers , the latching eyes , the whispers of women who wouldn  t be . newline newline newline the geese howled as i came . they strutted , presenting their tender breasts and thighs . newline newline newline it wasn  t hard to extract the girl . just a warm hand and promise ,  i  m your student , love.  she liked that , round lips pulled up in unrestrained satisfaction . newline she deserved every ounce of it , i hadn  t lied . newline newline newline i took her back   let  s go to your place ,  she said , cheeks tinged in the mortification of middleclass parents watching movies and waiting up  . newline she marveled as soon as we entered , she said i had everything . newline newline newline  almost.  newline newline newline i used to worry that i could never be a student to death for i  d never know it . but then i realized , in the cool , stewed hours of night , that there was only one way for someone to ever become an expert and i could still succeed . for if you succumb to death , you may recognize it for a moment , but just then , in that instant , you lose everything . the only way to manage was if you knew death without ever befalling her lesson yourself . i could that . we could do that . newline though i had never known death , i had imagined it with more vigor than anyone . it was the thing i needed , the thing i couldn  t have . newline newline newline i didn  t want it to be too quick , i needed time to learn . newline newline newline so i laid her on the bed , her fair skin rippling with anticipation . she was so soft i worried my rough , learned hands might tear or break her too soon . i ran my eyes over her . her waist hadn  t yet ruined itself with dents , or her stomach with lines . she was slick , and new , and perfect . newline newline newline her neck was about the same as one of my hands , which was nice , so i could stroke her hair with the other . newline newline newline her eyes grew wide , changing from the fear of the unknown to the fear of certainty . i watched for every detail , soaking in the lesson so as to never forget . newline newline newline her cheeks tinged red , like her lips , and her hands were weak as they tugged on my fingers . when they gave up , i worried . newline newline newline  tell me , please ,  i whispered into her ear , hearing the whine of her effort . newline newline newline  what does it feel like to die ?  newline newline newline and though i released on her wind pipe for a moment , to give her a chance . newline newline newline she said nothing . newline newline newline i panicked that i had done wrong , i had missed the lesson entirely with my greed . but then i saw her eyes , and they told me everything i needed to know . newline newline newline i learned of death that night without succumbing  the only way to become to a master . newline newline newline as i extracted myself , kissing her forehead and tucking her in , i heard a crunch beneath my foot . newline newline newline in her excitement she  d dropped her bag , it seemed . it was small , and white , like a clamshell , its guts spilling out . i raised a boot to see a crushed red lipstick beneath . newline newline newline i picked up the bag . the only thing left inside was a shiny , blue pair of knitting needles . i pulled them out with the fascination of fate . newline newline newline wonderful , i thought , tomorrow i  d learn to knit . welcome to epiconscious .  the existence next to me intoned . newline newline i turned to become more aware of him and found my self staring into a vast cacophony of thoughts and voices . the existence beside me was vast , huge with out having size , defining with out producing sound . yet for all it s unbelievable magnitude , i did not feel dwarfed . newline newline  epi what ?  i asked , but before the existance could respond i supplied my own answer . epiconscious . above thought . the vast collective mind of our entire selves . newline newline  you are the first of your kind to solve the puzzle of consciousness . others will follow you , but none shall have influence that you have now . what designation do you wish to applied to you .  that last you  was meant to be plural . he meant all of me ... us ... humans , but also not in the same way . newline newline  woah , i m confused ,  i tried to convey ,  what is the puzzle of consciousness .  newline newline the existence responded imitatively ,  sapient creatures who have not progressed to a stage of epiconsciousness , in a mode similar to sentient creatures who have not attained consciousness , regularly submit themselves to a recursive internal analysis . the consciousness , capable of recognizing itself and understanding of its bodily independence from other creatures breaks itself apart and looks at itself through a thousand warped mirrors in an attempted to completely know itself . life tends to become self aware and awareness tries to do the same .  the existence paused before inquiring ,  it takes on many forms in the vastness of our universe , this cyclical contemplation , what is your species method of inquiry ?  newline newline i do nt understand a lot of what the existence is trying to convey , even if it sends its thoughts straight to me , for some reason the building blocks it uses does nt make sense . before i was here , i was dreaming . i had had the dream before , it was another one of my squeal dreams . i knew that i had dreamed the dream before , slightly different but much the same . however , unlike people who claim to have lucid dreams i was nt actually a part of the dream . i was floating like a camera watching the actions of the people in my dream as they replayed for perhaps the hundredth time the destruction of their trailer park planet by the offspring of a chicken and the fire breathing dragon from the center of the sun . newline newline somehow things made sense know . i do nt know where the thoughts came from , they seemed so big and already formed that it felt like i could nt have thought them , but an answer for that came shortly too . newline newline  we dream .  i answered the existences question ,  during a time of rest our body removes most of its sensory functionality and investigates itself in a semicatatonic state . our memories are analyzed and connected through our information starved consciousness . information from our individual findings are spread through out our unaware epiconscious by means of music , art , food , tradition , gossip , politics , and stories , but the individual analysis of our consciousness is completed by algorithms devised by our dreaming minds .  newline newline the near by existence understood , at least a little .  we dreamed  ourselves to self aware self awareness by splitting our conscious minds and having them echo our sensations back to us at a slight delay . what an interesting way you achieved epiconscious . no others are like it that we know .  newline newline  thank you .  i responded , and then to answer his other question ,  we shall be designation : dreamer .  newline newline  welcome dreamer .  the existence responded ,  our designation is shattered echo split mirror . you seem like you shall be good celestial neighbors .  newline newlinei awoke to the sound of my dog scratching at the door . groaning and stretching , i got out of my bed and let my dog out into the harsh winter . i checked the calendar  only a few hours until my solitude was broken . how long had it been ? almost 6 years ? newline newline perhaps i should explain , in my world , people are born with their souls tied to a star . the color of the star determines their eye color . redbrown being the most common , yet mundane powers : basic telekinesis , surface mind reading , and blue being the rarest , but most powerful : shapeshifting , superfast regeneration , flight and other such things . only , there was one rule : our powers would remain unusable until we hit the age of 18 , one week from now . newline newline i was born with blue eyes to a very proud white eyed mother and yellow eyed father . growing up , my life was wonderful . i had plenty of friends , went to some of the best schools , and was well loved and accepted , that is until i turned 12 . on my 12th birthday , my eyes flashed , and then faded to black . usually , when a blue s eyes fade to black , it means they re dead . but i was still alive . so i was banished to the far north until the age of 18 , when my powers would become apparent , today . newline newline the helicopter came as it usually would , but instead of bearing supplies , it carried some of the most important leaders of the world , and more importantly , it carried my family . i waited impatiently at the edge of the platform , giddy with excitement . screw the powers , this was the first human contact i d had since i was a preteen . i did nt even give my mom a good chance to get out of the cabin before i was attacking her with a bear hug . newline newline  my god , you ve grown so much ! i ve missed you so much  my mother said with tears in her eyes .  i ve missed so much ! i pray that you can come home after today .  newline newline this is surreal . wait , am i supposed to say something ?  uhh , hey mom ! i hope i can come home too  i muttered , still shocked  hey , um , where s dad ? newline newline  i m afraid he burnt out a few years ago , son . i m sorry we have to break the news like this  i heard a voice behind my mother say . moving so i could see the owner of the voice , i saw a welldressed man , whiteblue eyes .  allow me to introduce myself . my name is joshua cephei , i m the current president of the greater associated countries . i ve heard so much about you .  he said . to be perfectly honest , he was creeping me out a bit . newline newline  um , well , would you like some coffee ? i  ve got some brewing in the cabin  i managed to spit out . god , when did social situations become so hard ? i  d practiced this moment for years . damn newline newline  that would be great . shall we ?  cephei said . seriously , what was so creepy about this guy ? newline we made our way to the cabin  s main area . i had a pretty sweet gig , to be honest . hot water , running electricity , plenty of things to do . still would have appreciated a few friends through the years , but what can you do ? newline newline  so , mrs. sol , when was the time of birth again ?  cephei asked my mom . newline newline  oh , cygnus was born at noon , on the second . he always was punctual !  she laughed . cephei gave her a thin smile as he checked his watch newline newline  well , we were a bit late . its 11:55 right now . i had hoped to ask you some questions before the moment , but i think that it  d be more prudent to just wait until after the transformation , if that  s okay with you ?  cephei said newline newline  ssure  i stuttered ,  that  s just fine.  newline newline and then there was silence . as we sat and listened to the clock tick , i felt the tension of the room rise with every second that passed . newline newline  cygnus , do you have any cream ?  my mom said in a desperate attempt to breach the silence newline newline  uh , yeah , in the fridge in the back . help yourself to anything  i muttered . newline newline 11:57 . three minutes to show time . oh god , what if i die ? what if i don  t have any powers ? what kind of life can i live with no powers ? not even the most basic mail rooms will acc newline newline 11:58 . god , can  t the clock tick faster ? why is this so painful ? can  t i just get it over with ? i just want to rip the theoretical bandaid off , and get this over with . why newline newline 11:59 . one minute till show time . i close my eyes and try to shut out the world . i feel a hand on my shoulder . not gentle like my mothers , but heavy and rugged . my eyes shoot open and newline newline 12:00 . i feel numb . what  s happening ? it  s as if i  m some sort of vacuum sucking the world in through my eyes . i can see through the walls of the cabin . i can see the 20 or so swat officers ready to storm in if i go big . i can see my mother searching through the fridge for cream . i can see the gun in her purse . newline newline  how do you feel , big guy ?  i hear cephei ask .  cygnus ? how do you feel ?  he asks again . i see through his words . i see his intent . he wants to turn me into a weapon . he envisions me destroying cities . newline newline no . newline newline as if by instinct , i stand and drag him to his feet by his head . newline newline  cygnus ! let me go ! now  he shouts in surprise . newline newline i will not become a weapon . i will not become a pawn . i will be free . newline newline  no.  i bellow .  you would use me to kill others . your judgement is come . you are unworthy.  newline i don  t have control . i can  t stop myself . i stare into his eyes . i see the color surface , and then breach , slowly floating towards my eyes , and being absorbed . his eyes are left as a light grey . newline newline  whawhat did you do to me ?  he grunted . pitiful newline newline  i  ve seen your soul , and deemed you unworthy . i  ve taken your power  i sighed . newline newline so this was my future . judge of mankind . i don  t want to be god , but there  s no other choice . i look up , and teleport into orbit . there  s work to be done . newline  newline newline first time , ended up way bigger than i anticipated , sorry about the abrupt ending . constructive criticism welcome . edit : formatting that s what the computer says they said ,  explained jane as she examined the print out from the dot matrix printer . newline newline tom pushed his horn rimmed glasses back , sat down on the edge of the desk , and said ,  whoa .  newline newline  how do we communicate with them ? i mean , we must have been the first to see the morse code blinking quasar .  newline newline jane shrugged . the computer beeped again . jane bent over as tom pretended not to look at her rear , and pressed the record button on the tape drive connected to the university s trs80 computer . after a few seconds she hit stop , rewound , and played it back into the computer . tom bent over and typed in  run  and they both stared at the screen . newline newline  code decoded : show us now . be honest .  newline newline  umm , i sometimes litter ,  said jane to no one in particular . newline newline  i steal sometimes ,  tom said as jane made an exaggerated frown .  people are dishonest , i guess ,  he added with a shrug . newline newline jane looked around the room . tom scratched his chin . newline newline  nothing ,  he said . newline newline the computer blinked the message again . the green pixelated  be honest  text burned into tom s brain . newline newline  i ... kinda want to fuck jane right here over this desk right now .  newline newline  what the fuck , tom ,  she said turning red . newline newline  we need to be honest here !  newline newline  i do nt want tom to fuck me . i m sick of his pretentious and knowitall attitude .  newline newline  oh arent you miss goodygoody , so you re perfect then ?  newline newline  no ... i want ... more . a job at a better university , tenure , more money , and some fucking recognition in a decent journal for once . i m never satisfied i guess .  newline newline tom snapped his fingers and grinned . he yelled ,  we re insatiable . we want more . we want to expand and take over . that s our biggest fault ! it true . its fucking true . so ... true .  he stomped his foot ,  more land , more money . more military spending , more nukes , more everything ! more every fucking thing ! its never enough ! ! !  he noticed his eyes tearing up . jane also noticed and looked away . newline newline the computer beeped . jane pressed the record button and waited . tom bit his nails . tom typed  run  again . newline newline the screen blinked one final message ,  code decoded : that is the only inexcusable trait . goodbye .  newline newline jane gasped ,  the quasar is back to blinking normally .  newline newline  i guess they meant it ,  added tom .  i uh.. should go home . i m very embarrassed . i uh..  newline newline jane bit her lip and slowly shut the office door ,  shut up and take your goddamn pants off . lets be ... human .  newline newlinei looked at the small minifridge next to my television set . newline newline  you re going to have to change it eventually .  my wife said . newline newline  i know , i just want it to be perfect ... that s all .  newline newline she folded her arms .  yes hun . but you say that everyday . bella just needs a room , she can change it when she s older .  she replied . newline newline she was right of course , but it did nt make my decision any easier to deal with . newline newline i continued staring at the fridge , it s white door and silver handle glistened from being polished each sunday morning . the body of the fridge was clear from dust and grime . you could eat off it if necessary i liked to take care of my things . newline newline in the corner of the room my baby girl spoke to me .  dadda ! why you lookin like tha !  newline newline i felt my stomach drop and gave her a big smile .  daddies going to give you a big colorful room , all for you .  newline newline she smiled cheekily . newline newline i smiled back . newline newline i knelt down on all fours and opened the door . it was cold inside , but i pushed myself through the now tightly fitting passageway . newline newline  see you soon , honey !  my wife shouted from behind me and closed the fridge door . newline newline i clambered out of the end of the fridge passage way and into the world i had created . newline newline great lush palm trees and forest stood in front of me . to my right a small tree house sat comfortably in the firm grasp of a willow . each step gave a fimiliar creak as i walked to the top and sat in my favourite rocking chair . newline newline through the window i saw mountains in the distance , and a warm sunset on the horizon , blazing at me . newline newline animals drank from the lakes below the peaks and small trees dotted the grassy landscape . newline newline i wiped away wetness from my eye , enjoying the last look at my landscape . newline newline snapping my fingers . a corona light with lemon appeared in my hand . i sipped , thinking about how i could make this room fitting for a girl . newline newline fluffy clouds and candy canes . pink , blue , purple and yellow . shiny , sparkly and cosy . i d put teddy bears for her to play with , that looked after her and sang songs . newline newline she d be a princess , with a castle and in the distance a rainbow with a unicorn would dance on the horizon . newline newline it all sounded so cheesy , but still fitting for a girl . newline newline i d consult with my wife before changing things . this had to be perfect it was for my daughter nonetheless . newline newline clambering back into the passageway , i made my trip back to the lounge . newline newline one more day of thinking could nt hurt . i d come back tomorrow and change it then . newline how do you know it was a crossbow ?  asked borin . newline newline  look at the wound . right through . certainly , a bow could penetrate with enough force , but look at where we are . a small alleyway . there s hardly enough room to wield one in here . no , my guess is a crossbow . more compact , easier to wield in a tight space , most definitely more effective at close range ...  william continued to examine the body .  ... and the criminal obviously had to force the bolt out . he wanted to make sure he left as little behind as possible .  newline newline  but how do you know he got away on horseback ?  asked borin . newline newline  because there s horse shit at the end of the alley ,  said william . newline newline  oh .  newline newline  say , borin , this sun is excessively bright today , do nt you think ?  newline newline  yes , now that you mention it . if only you had something to keep the sun out of your eyes .  newline newline  if only ,  said william .  if only .  hmmph .  i mutter as i roll over in my bed , eyes sheepishly opening for a moment in the dark , as i get comfortable to fall back asleep . newline newline my lizard brain the only part actually awake : wonder what time it is .  so i reach for my cellphone and doubletap the lock screen button to get a glimpse of the time , the backlight momentarily illuminating the room . newline newline adrenaline spike , brain fully awake now : what was that ? !  was that a shadow in the corner ? a figure ? my imagination ? cautious and frozen i lay perfectly still in the dark listening . i can feel a presence . this is no nightmare . this is real . three seconds that seem like an hour go by , and then i hear it . a page turning . newline newline slowly and silently , my hand reaches forward , towards the nightstand . do nt need to see , practiced a million times . time to focus . grab the gun , rack the slide , engage the flashlight . you can do this .  newline newline i feel the tip of my finger graze the cold steel of the gun . ok , i m ready . visualize the action first . have to get this perfect . god i wish i had more training .  newline newline and then in half a second it s out and up . i fumble once for half a second with the flashlight toggle and then it s on , 600ish lumens . spotlight on a hooded figure in the corner off the room . bang bang bang . and then ... newline newline nothing . it does nt move , at first . and i realize what it is . it s death . at least what death is in the movies , in books . a black robbed figure . beneath : a skeleton . tall , and that trademarked sickle and shiny blade resting on the corner of the wall beside . and it s reading a book . my book . it s head raises , looking up at the page into my eyes with black sockets . it s voice both somehow smokey and also hissing , as if a forked tongue were speaking for a flame .  you know , i think that may be the first time anyone has ever tried to reap me .  newline newline i stare . i m paralyzed . i ca nt think anything . mind racing so fast it ca nt do anything . like a computer running too fast , too many programs open . glitch in the code . he somehow flicks his phalanges and simultaneously both the light affixed to my weapon goes out , and the candle on my dresser alights , just barely illuminating my small room . it speaks again :  you really are lucky that you have no loved ones the other side of this wall you just shot through . if you did , i d now have to take them .  it pauses for a moment .  you know , i really disdain this visage . but i needed to let you know who i am . and i can not lie to you , i have an affinity for the dramatic .  newline newline another flick of his notfingers . the robed and hooded figure has been replaced by a man . at least it looks like a man . what , how , i did nt even ...  there was nt even a transition . no flash , no smoke . i ca nt even recall the moment in which he changed . he was just one thing , and then another . newline newline he was still tall , and that sickle still laid next to him , but the rest had changed . he was now a man . ravenblack , slicked hair . like back in the 50 s . chiseled chin , nice and square . strong jawline . clean shaven . slightly large , but very pleasing nose . and those eyes . piercing , starring eyes . the most intense shade of blue you could ever imagine . unnatural , those eyes were . athletic build , and wearing a suit , with a black tie . perfect cut , too . as if the devil were his tailor , and no one were a better tailor than the devil . had a cigarette betwixt his fingers that he d puff on now and again , but there was no smell of tobacco in the room , and it never burned down , or ashed . newline newline his voice changed too :  that s better ,  said death , closing the book that he was reading but keeping a finger in to keep his spot ,  i m sure you know , i usually just take . the lucky ones , such as yourself , silently in the dark of the night without a fuss . good for you , no pain . and good for me .  i hack and cough .  that cold you have ? not a cold . you should have seen a doctor . they might have caught it in time . always interesting when the young ones go .  newline newline i suddenly became conscious of the fact that i had nt breathed since i pulled the trigger on my weapon  minus the hacking and coughing  . this was the first thing my brain was able to establish since i first starred death in the face . i began to force myself to breath again . newline newline death continued ,  but sometimes , i am hit with a mood .  he paused .  sometimes , you mortals entertain me . just as you have tonight with your book collection . very good stuff , not as extensive as i have seen , but expertly cultivated . and when i m in one of my moods , sometimes instead of just taking , i like to offer a choice . it seems you ve won the lottery , my dear friend . you have until i finish this book to make your choice , and there are a few simple rules . and if , you do not make your choice by the time i finish this book , or you try to circumvent the rules , you will go with me into that dark night . but if you play my little game tonight , and if you are wise , you may delay your rendezvous with death to another time . what say you ?  newline newline edit : typo . and modifiers .dwight :  ok people , listen up ! michael will be out of the office this week . he told me , as his assistant  newline newline jim :  to the  newline newline d :  same thing  newline newline j :  nope , its not .  glances at camera newline newline d :  whatever , he wants me to run the office for a couple days in his stead . and trust me , we will be as efficient as a cylon colony , and just as deadly .  newline newline                                              newline newline interview with pam :  last week i walked in on michael watching this show where bosses go undercover at their company and pretend to be a new hire . he had that look in his eyes , you know ? like ,   makes a face like an excited child   . the next day he told me that he hired a new intern named bryan . he said bryan was  one of the funniest , coolest guys he knows and he was really super funny .  anyway the new guy should be here any minute and we re all expecting it to be michael with a mustache or something . if it is we re going to just go with it because if we do nt , we ll just have to , you know work . and stuff .  newline newline wide shot of the office , sound of the door opening . pan to door to see micheal wearing a black mustache and blonde wig newline newline michael :  hello new friends !  newline newline roll introthere it was . she had spent the entire life working towards this moment . the eroding pyramids slowly filtered into her view . they were , as they once were above , teeming with life . it gave her a rush of excitement . it was magnificent to behold  it was beautiful .  newline newline she swam towards to the closest building . the blurred lines and washed out colors began to sharpen , introducing new and vibrant colors . decorating the stones of the building were carved elaborate patterns and impressions . they were softened and covered in coral , but the aged look only made it more mystifying to behold . she needed to go deeper . newline newline in the distance she could see a soft glow . but it was nt coming from above . it was coming from somewhere ... deeper . she glided over the city towards the light . as the buildings passed below her the light became stronger . it was just over a cliff edge ahead . newline newline her watch buzzed . it was an alarm . a feeling of panic seized her . she had been so distracted looking for and exploring the city that she had forgotten to monitor her oxygen levels . she checked the oxygen meter and saw that she was mere minutes away from running dry . her heart was beating faster and faster , her breathing moving at a matching pace . she was going to burn through it a lot faster now . knowing she did nt have long , she decided to swim towards the source of the light . newline newline she reached the edge of the cliff and looked over into the valley below . what she saw was beyond what she could imagine . she stared and took what she thought was her last breath , and sank slowly over the cliff and into the valley floor . and then something huge swam into her vision , and blocked out the light .after my twin , fresia , stepped out from in front of the mirror , she looked halfhearted , then immediately filled with glee , and started to rant her fresia rantyrants . newline newline  i saw some guysome greatlooking guy , with short curly hair and brown eyesuhh..and well , it was really foggy so i didn  t see much elseyour turn , maggie.  newline newline okay , great , my turn . i shoved her to the side , ya know , just in case the mirror would break from too much of the same person at one time . didn  t want this one magical thing this rancid town had left to turn rancid as well . i stepped in front of the mirror slowly , but kept my eyes down . i stared deeply into the ground . the mirror probably needed some time . i mean , there are tons of people in this world and this mirror had to find one . the one . my one . newline newline  look up , loser ,  fresia spat and shoved me from behind ,  your true love will vanish before you take the time to care , doesn  t last forever you know.  newline newline maybe she  s right , this mirror  s got things to do , people to see , futures to process . i start to shift my gaze upwards . newline newline as i lift my head , i see in the mirror only one set of legs , one torso ... fuck i screwed uptook too long . i see the face attached to the bodyitit s , fresia . newline newline  well , what do they look like ? huh ? cmon ?  she screamed in excitement . newline newline  umm , well , actually , i saw you.  i said bluntly , really no other way to put it . newline newline fresia just stared at me . ya , now she probably thinks i  m some incestuous freak who is in love with her . i mean , don  t get me wrong , she looks greatjust like me in fact , but she  s no cat  s meow , no big kahuna , no cigaryou get the picture . newline newline  ii saw you too , i mean , like you saw mei saw only you  . newline newline we both slumped down and fell to the ground . did we both love each other ? was this mirror for real ? could i read her thoughts ? hmm , no , i just tried , unless she  s thinking the same thing as me . newline newline  what  re you thinking ?  newline newline  would nt you like to know .  newline newline edit : spelling newline doctor monee the kingdom needs you !  newline newline king mayor , what s wrong this time ? newline newline  well , you know how everyone at court used to laugh at you on account of your bad breath .  newline newline yes . newline newline  but then we had that drought and you said we d turn the sea into fresh water . and i said you were the biggest idiot the world had ever seen   newline newline please ! king mayor , get on with it . what do you need ? is the tunnel that condenses heated salt

okay , but everyone must do exactly as i say . newline newline  yes . i differ to you .  newline newline give up . newline newline  what ?  newline newline there is no difference to me or the commoners . who rules us ? who cares . it s all the same . therefore to save the kingdom it is best not to get the kingdom caught up in a destructive war . newline newline  oh , dr. monee , this is some cruel joke . you ca nt be serious . what you say is treason .  newline newline listen king mayor , with everyone fighting the invaders there will be no one to grow the food . famine will stalk the land . famine destroys the next generation . no youth to replace those that die in the fighting . that means a depopulated countryside that produces nothing and fills with dangerous animals . my plan is the only logical one . newline newline  monee , you ve come up with this from off the top of your ass but i can not deny the logic . this is why we call you doctor . how did you become so flawless in your reasoning ?  newline newline i always say the first thing that comes to my head . newline newline  i wish you had nt told me that .  newline newline why ? newline newline  because now i ll have to take your head . i ca nt trust it . and neither can you .  newline newline the end he aint no gunslinger : they call him the spellslinger  echoed in his mind as he approached the saloon . newline newline walking into the saloon , roscoe boone surveyed the inhabitants drinking themselves stupid . roscoe was known to prefer to bring his bounties in dead , rather than alive . this bounty was very special however , as it was one that required killing a towns sheriff who happened to be a former preacher . the idea of killing a lawman was satisfying , but the idea of killing a preacher as well brought a sick smile to roscoe s face . he was met with a silent glances from almost everyone in the room , as he stood in the doorway . hacking loudly , he spat on the ground as he pulled out the old wanted poster that read : newline newline fr . ashton clay newline dead or alive :  5000 newline 6 ft tall , dark hair , one blue eye , one red eye , scar on his left hand in the shape of a star in a circle . newline newline roscoe spent the last year hunting down the holy man , and he always got his man . which is what brought him to the town of lostpoint , a shitty little town on the edge of nowhere . roscoe walked up to the bar , and grinned his dirty yellow smile at the prostitute at the end of the bar before looking at the bartender . newline newline roscoe was an intimidating man for sure . his face was almost always dirty with his beard a thick shade of black that made all the food caught in it stand out . he was a large strong man , whose stench was often a mix of sweat , whiskey , and blood . he had killed his first man at the age of 12 , and his second man a day after that . roscoe was always the stronger man after that lesson was learned , by any means necessary . this is probably why roscoe became a bounty hunter . the appeal of committing murder for money , and not facing the consequences from the law made this the perfect job for him . newline newline  gim me a whiskey ...  roscoe said , smiling at the mustached bartender . newline pouring the glass before the disgusting looking man , the bartender gulped loudly as the other bar patrons went about their business . newline newline  what brings ya to lostpoint , pardner ?  the bartender asked , as roscoe downed his whiskey with a satisfying sigh that followed . newline newline  i m looking for your sheriff .  roscoe stated , looking around the bar . newline newline  why would you be looking for him ?  the bartender asked , cleaning off the glass that roscoe just drank from before roscoe slammed the wanted poster onto the table . newline newline  because , i m aiming to take him in and claim his bounty .  roscoe said , a grin passing his face . newline newline whispers erupted from the patrons , as roscoe turned around to smile at the townsfolk . he had seen this before . newline  i think your mistaken , friend .  the bartender argued , trying to sound more in charge than he probably was . newline newline  i aint mistaken . ashton clay , wanted for the murder of over twelve of his flock during a single sermon . red eye and a scar on his left hand , sound familiar to you folks ?  roscoe mocked , as he picked up and waved the wanted poster in the air . newline  it was fourteen , son .  a voice from the second floor corrected . newline newline all the heads in the saloon shot up , and looked towards the source of the voice . standing shirtless , was a man who looked like he was in his forties . his hair was black with grey on the sides , a mustache crowning his upper lip , one red eye , one blue eye , and a scar on his left hand in the shape of a star in a circle . young prostitutes stood on either side of him , as he looked down at the dirty bounty hunter at the bar . newline newline  now , i aint a holy man , but i dont think the bible looks fondly on men of the cloth conversing with whores .  roscoe mocked , as he looked up at his target . newline newline  i aint a man of the cloth no more .  ashton said , as one of the young women handed him his black shirt , collar , and cross . newline newline  now if thats true , why do yaall still wear that cross ?  roscoe laughed , keeping a his hand close to his six shooter . newline newline  as a reminder .  ashton responded , glaring down at roscoe . newline newline  of all them people you killed ? lot good that does .  roscoe said , smiling up to the sheriff . newline newline ashton couldnt forget those people that died in his church , all those years ago . he , however was not to blame for their deaths . father clay was a good man and decent with a gun , but not all good men inspire goodness in others . during his sermon , august ellison and his brother roy , marched in with guns . they were chanting some crazy talk while they slaughtered ashtons flock , and laughed . pinning him down to the alter , they blinded him in one eye and branded ashton with the scar now on his left hand . just then , a large fiery hole ripped open in the center of the room , freeing all manner of monsters from it . the burn on ashton s hand glowed , and burned worse than it had before . he saw some dark shadow rush towards him , and into his body . in this moment , the world stopped . like everyone else had stopped in time , and it was just ashton that could move , and someone else who hadnt been there before . newline newline  hello ashton .  he said , his voice inhuman but calming at the same time . newline newline  am i dead ?  ashton asked , as he picked himself up from the ground . newline newline  no ... well not yet .  he said , offering ashton a hand to get up . newline newline  are you the devil ?  ashton asked , looking at the hand before him . he looked and dressed like a rich man , but his voice was the most demonic thing ashton had ever heard before . newline newline  would it make you feel better if i said yes ?  it asked , its handsome face frowning as it looked at ashton . newline newline  to be continued in response that was done . i looked at my memory card , and thought that i this tiny thumbnailsized device is the most valuable object in the world right now . it was time to start acting . newline newline first steps were simple  money and power  because why not ? stealing some bitcoins and writing a script that transfers 1 dollar out of every existing bank account immediately made me the richest man in the world . breaking into personal computers of the world s leaders quickly gave me enough dirt on every one of them to hold all of their power in my hands . newline newline some of them did nt cave , so i had to break into a few biggest government organizations , and find the darkest dirtiest secrets of every nation . now even the most honest and willful leaders were in my hands , having to act in the interest of their nations . newline newline what s next ? world peace , i guess , just for the fuck of it . threatening all of the most powerful dictators into submission stopped most of the wars . of course many of the dictators were crazy and stubborn , so i had to demonstrate my power by launching a nuclear strike in the middle of the desert . that convinced them that i am crazy and powerful enough to take any action necessary . acting incognito , and unconstrained by complicated international politics , i was free to stop all the wars pretty quickly . newline newline now i was free to build my own world order , and reshape human civilization to my taste .i remember my life on earth as though it were yesterday , despite all my attempts to forget it . newline newline i was the first born to a family of junkies . i was obviously an accident , and as such was considered one . my father spent all available money on drugs and alcohol . this included any of my money . i remember with clarity my fifth birthday . tearing excitedly into an envelope from my grandmother and exclaiming with joy as i lifted out the crisp twentydollar bill . my father looked up from his bottle and promptly snatched the bill from my hands . i started to protest , only to receive a swift backhand and a harsh  shut up you little twerp .  i looked with tearfilled eyes to my mother , hoping maybe she would stand up for me . her dark , sunken eyes gazed into mine for a second or two , and then she left . i never saw her again . newline newline that whole  all mothers have love for their children  bull crap ? i never felt it . newline newline as i grew up , i realized school was nt easy . the subjects were fine , but my peers were another story . my father continued to spend all his welfare money on substances , so sometimes i could nt have a shower . food was also hard to come by , so my ribs were always visible behind my pale skin . i was different , and so i was never accepted . i was given names , such as  that dark kid  or  smelly  . beatings were a regular occurrence . i got them at school from the other kids that felt inadequate , and when i got home i got them from my similarly inadequate father . newline newline it was probably high school when the depression set in . i was constantly told things like  you ll never amount to anything  and  you ll be just like your father .  after so long i began to believe them . i had no dreams , no ambitions , and the only thing i looked forward to was a pack of cigarettes , a bottle of whiskey , and maybe a few pills waiting for me at the end of the day . these only made the depression worse . all the selfloathing grew and grew , until it seemed like it would overwhelm me . newline newline after high school , i stayed with my father for a while . i eventually grew tired of his abuse , and so i left . i sought refuge in homeless centers , but i could never stay long as the other residents did nt like me . i certainly did nt have a charming personality , and sometimes a simple disagreement over where to sleep could turn into a fullout brawl . so i spent most of my time sleeping on park benches . it would get so cold sometimes . i would lay there , shivering , thinking ,  tonight is the night . i ll die right here on the bench .  but i never did . part of me always wished i had . newline newline it went on like this for about twenty years . i would occasionally find jobs , but i would always be fired quickly due to my smell and  rageprone behavior .  money was scarce , and so was food . any money i got would usually go to drugs and alcohol to feed my addiction . on top of all of this , the voices in my mind would never stop . sometimes they would sound like people in my life , like my father , or sometimes they were completely new . whatever they were , they always tore me down , worsening my self hate . newline i just wanted to die , but i knew i could never to it myself . newline newline and then that day came . newline newline it was a sunday morning . i was laying on a bench after yet another sleepless night . the voices were screaming , all at once , and they would nt stop . i closed my eyes , and for the first time in my life , i prayed .  god ,  i said ,  have mercy on me .  i began to cry , just laying there , letting the last bit of hope slip through my fingers . and then i felt a hand on my shoulder . newline newline  i hear you ,  it said . newline newline i looked up and saw a man in brilliant white clothing . his face shone like a thousand shards of glass . the sun seemed to shine directly from behind him , and his hands glowed like bronze .  your time is up ,  the man said . his voice was low and pleasant , like one i d never heard before . it carried with it a sense of compassion , which in all my years i had never experienced . newline newline my tears continued to fall .  man ,  i sobbed ,  i do nt know what you re talking about , but anything is better than this . my life , it s like a living hell .  newline newline at this the man gave a small grin .  it s funny you should say that . that s exactly where you ve been .  newline newline newline edit : grammatical errors newline newline   newline newline if you liked this , check out some of my other writings at raliasfakenamei was having a midlife crisis . it was weighing on me , and i decided to go for a long walk to visit an old friend . he d just moved to a new place , to a side of the county i had nt been to before , and as luck would have it i somehow lost the beaten path and ended up walking through a dark patch of woods . newline newline newline i looked all around but it was just brambles , trees , bushes and the occasional nastylooking patch of poison ivy . everything seemed to have thorns and the overall effect was ... spooky . i do nt like to think of myself as no kind of scaredycat , mind , but it was hard not to feel a little nervous in a place like this . i just kept walking . newline newline newline eventually i saw a break in the trees , some light ahead . through the clearing i could see the mountains in the distance , the sun shining bright on the snowy tops . feeling better , i took a deep breath and walked more cheerful like toward the way out . newline newline newline suddenly i heard a twig snap . then another . footsteps . there was some kind of critter heading my way  then all at once i looked up ahead and saw a giant mountain lion , eyes bright and shining , looking right at me like it was fixing to have me for dinner , crouching down low and ready to pounce . newline newline newline shit !  i turned tail and started running as fast as i could go , not stopping to look behind me but listening to hear the big mountain cat s paws crunching on leaves and twigs as he ran after me . this is not how it was supposed to end , i thought to myself . everything i d ever regretted , every way i d ever done someone wrong , all my sins and misdemeanors , everything rushed through my mind in those few moments as i ran back into the forest . newline newline i was dimly aware of running past a fence and a mailbox , but suddenly i heard a rifle shot ring out , then another , and another . i pulled up to a dead stop , wondering if i d been shot , but instead i saw the mountain lion tearing away scared out of its mind , limping on one leg . i turned and suddenly saw an old man standing by the fence , appeared out of thin air like a ghost . he was very old , wise looking , with a rifle in his hand and a straw hat , decorated all round with a ring of green leaves , on his head . newline newline newline  evening there , friend ,  the man said amiably .  seems you ve lost your way .  newline newline  can you help me ?  i gasped , out of breath .  i m lost , i do nt know where i am ...  newline newline it suddenly occurred to me to look on my phone and find a map . i d just gotten one of those new smartphones , and i knew it had a program that you could use , it would link up with a satellite and tell you exactly where you were . but when i opened the app , i fussed with it a little and could nt see anything . just a blank open space and what must have been some error message , but i got this phone secondhand and whoever had it first must have spoke a different language , because i could nt understand the words on the screen : lasciate ogni speranza , voi chintrate .  newline newline newline i looked up at the old man , who was standing there patiently , watching me , knowingly . newline newline newline  who ... .where ... .  newline newline newline the old man extended his hand formally , and i took it hesitantly .  name s virgil ,  he said politely .  you might say , you re exactly where you need to be . come with me , and let s go for a walk ...  newline newline newline newline newline  apologies to mr . alighieri .  newline newlinejolder grimaced into his cup of tea when he heard the chime of the bell . another bleeding customer . ah , well , the tea is cold anyway . when was the last time i had a hot mug of tea ?  he drained the cup in one gulp , shuddering at the temperature , and made his way to the front of the store . newline newline he rounded the corner , an unpleasant squelch meeting his ears . he held his breath . standing at the counter was a hunter , bow slung over his back , a look of smug satisfaction playing across his features . jolder could nt see far enough into his hood to identify the man . newline newline  good afternoon .  jolder said , inclining his head minimally to his patron .  how can i be of assistance to you ... ?  newline newline  mandorin . of grinnet . i ve brought you the synapses of a mind flayer .  he indicated the burlap sack oozing on the counter .  it was nt an easy kill , but i got the job done .  newline newline jolder steeled himself before lifting the edge of the sack to peer inside . well i ll be damned . this bumpkin actually managed to kill an illithid he squashed his excitement , instead favoring his patron with a look of disdain .  the synapses . yes . however , you ve neglected to cut them out . what am i to do with the head of a mind flayer ?  newline newline mandorin lifted the hood from his head , glaring daggers at jolden .  i ve brought you the damned thing . i m no surgeon , that s what you re for , is nt it ?  newline newline jolder arched an eyebrow at him , not dropping his gaze .  aye , it s what i m for . but it ll cost you . i ll not give you full payment for a job i have to do myself . five knuckles .  he fished five gold coins from the pocket of his coat to toss onto the counter . mandorin s face was murderous . newline newline  five knuckles ! five knuckles , he says ! a mind flayer s synapses are easily worth fifteen !  he was seething . newline newline jolder met his glare impassively .  aye , they are worth fifteen , when they ve been properly extracted . the process is a dangerous one , you re lucky you did nt try . then , they d be worthless , and you d be dead .  newline newline mandorin s jaw clenched around what jolder could only assume was a veritable tirade of insults .  i wo nt take less than ten .  he spat , acidly . newline newline jolder smiled widely . you can not hope to win this game , boy  i ll give you five , and a one use , two hour , scroll of invisibility .  newline newline  eight .  he fired back .  i brought you the teeth as well , you can use those .  newline newline jolder inclined his head minimally .  eight , the scroll , and you have to clean my counters and floor .  he indicated the congealed mess on his counter with a nod . newline newline mandorin sighed .  done . filthy thief . high above the earth s atmosphere , a spaceship hovered . newline newline to humans , the spaceship would ve appeared very small . it was barely an inch in diameter , and looked like a perfect sphere . it hid itself among the satellites and debris orbiting around the planet , evading detection by disguising itself as a piece of space junk . newline newline inside the spaceship lived an entire alien civilization . to humans , the aliens would ve appeared bizarre . each individual alien was tiny , the size of a virus , and billions of them lived in the spaceship . they , like their ship , were spherical in shape , featureless except for a multitude of colors that pulsed across their surfaces . they used these pulses to communicate with one another . newline newline today , the aliens were flashing colors at one another in a state of what humans would ve called excitement . the colors pulsed again and again , starting in chaos but eventually settling into one synchronous message . to humans , the message would mean it s confirmed , it s proven , or we re sure of it now . newline newline  newline newline donald van kean was , to most people , completely unremarkable . he was a retired soldier , having served in the army , and now worked as a taxi driver . it was nt a very lucrative living , but he managed to keep himself fed and clothed . he d never married , had no children , and had very few friends . he was of medium height , medium build , and had brown hair that was graying at the temples . to his fellow man , donald did not merit a second glance . newline newline to the aliens , he was their savior . newline newline on this day , donald set out from his rundown apartment building and settled into his cab . before he could turn the ignition , though , his windshield shattered and something embedded itself into his shotgun seat with a loud bang . donald s first instinct was that someone was shooting at him . he dived down under his dashboard and took cover . he listened hard , but could hear nothing but his pounding heart . he craned his neck and looked up at the broken windshield , at the massive hole and the spiderweb of cracks . he peered at the bullet lodged in the leather of the seat s headrest , until he realized it did nt look like a bullet . it looked like a large dark blue marble . newline newline and then he noticed the marble seemed to be giving off something , a gas or smoke of some sort . the smoke wisped out from the marble , and thenand here donald was really surprisedinstead of drifting up or out , it sank down toward him , cowering under his dashboard . newline newline the smoke touched his skin , and immediately his mind was filled with colors . newline newline a few disorienting moments later , he realized the colors were talking to him . not in any language he knew , in fact , not in any language at all . he was receiving fundamental ideas in his mind , transmitted directly into his brain without being constrained by the limits of language . they were like feelings , but far more precise and far more detailed . the message he was getting most

was filled to the brim with numerous customers . nonstop chattering and gesturing of limbs at the glowing hologram screens greeted me as i walked towards my office door . my eyes quickly brushed over the crowd . eyes glued to the screens , all busy talking to their spc s  super personal computers  , giving instructions as the 3d data was displayed on the glowing screens . newline newline newline

newline newline newline  pardon me ?  newline newline newline newline  yeah how old are you , if you can still remember using a key to open a door lock .  he snickered as he followed me into the office . obnoxious seventeen year old . he was getting too comfortable with me . newline newline newline newline newline i sunk into my seat , leaning back as i took several papers stacked inside an envolope . i dragged my office chair closer to the desk , squinting my eyes as i went through the job application forms . i flipped through , skimming over the cv s before i placed them back on the desk . human resource , i read the label on my desk . a loud click instinctively left my toungue . former hacktivist now a human resource manager , now that was a proper cv . i leaned back into the

voice called from the door , holding a brown box in his hand . newline newline newline newline newline  bring it to my desk , please .  i ran my hand through my balding head , tracking the delivery

newline  what ?  i wore a clueless expression as he handed me the box . newline newline newline newline  nothing . just have a nice day , sir .  he chuckled as he left into the cyberhall . newline newline newline newline newline it was finally here . i tore through the cover , unwrapping the contents . i brushed my hands over the box cover , analyzing its detail closely . call of duty : modern warfare 3 , i muttered to myself . twenty seven years ever since i played this gem . i reenacted a small victory dance inside my chair . nostalgia . it was time to crank up my well kept alienware laptop that had awaited this moment for years , and relive my long lost youth . but i could nt do it alone , i wanted somebody else to see this . newline newline newline newline newline newline the distant chattering from the cyberhall penetrated the cream white office walls . the fizzing of an energy drink and the rapid clicking of my mouse engulfing the moment . i held my arms over my head as i cracked my knuckles , waiting for the next map to load up . i threw a glance at jimmy , still wearing his shit eating grin , his glance arrested by the screen . newline newline newline newline  not bad . wow , not bad at all .  he broke the silence , gently nodding in affirmation . newline newline newline newline i could nt resist a chuckle . newline newline newline newline newline  there are still a couple more golden titles coming this evening . i am telling ya , old is gold .  i smirked at him , lazily swinging in my office chair . newline newline newline newline  do nt overrate it . its graphics are chicken shit compared to the titles we have now .  he retorted , pulling himself closer to the laptop as he took hold of the mouse .  am still surprised they keep up its servers after all this years .  newline newline newline newline newline  its just one of those things i guess .  i replied , adjusting my trouser out of my butt crack . newline newline newline newline newline  the map has loaded . let me try it out abit .  jimmy asked , still adjusting to the concept of a handheld mouse .  what s happened ?  newline newline newline newline i stared at the server error message on the screen . its been long since i saw one . i took hold of the laptop , cracking my head at the issues . just like back in the days . i tapped at the keys , going through the error log file . i was still rusty , having never dealt with such an issue ever since the upgrade of the it industry through the years . a beep came from the machine . it was a warning . newline newline newline newline jimmy leaned in close . newline newline newline newline  woah , is that ... .an avira message box ? the fuck dude ! was nt that an anti virus ?  jimmy poked me with his elbow . i did nt budge . newline newline newline newline  look ! has it just detected a virus ?  his jaw drooped .  has it ? ? i have to call my pals to check this shit out . this is like..fucking unbelievable man . take a

. sorry  .a bladed glove traced inchdeep cuts in a brick wall , shedding dust and shrieking a dirge . the blades drew away , whispering into darkness , and bit deeply into black kevlar . a gauntleted fist struck a horribly scarred face , and a monster crumpled . newline newline a child s broken plaything , risen with evil intent , cackled his maddened way down the street . his knife , clutched in tiny fingers , swung upward and struck black ceramic armor . the blade snapped . a moment later , the tiny doll shattered . pieces of it rained down around the scarred monster . newline newline a dark figure drifted down the street on silent footsteps . his blade , an unassuming kitchen knife stained with a family s blood , rose and fell into a blackcowled spine . an armored elbow flew backward in perfect silence , smashing a white plastic mask and the face behind it . a third figure joined the untidy heap of stifled malevolence . newline newline heavy , booted feet approached from the other end of the street , bearing a hulk behind a white oval mask . meaty , gloved hands bore a tire iron and a machete , both rusted to sharp , jagged edges and soaked in innocent s blood . they whistled down toward the seemingly defenseless female figure , standing alone under the streetlight , only to be caught and twisted away . her hands clutched behind the masked head , dragging it down into an upthrust knee . fiberglass splintered , and the pile of broken villains grew yet again . newline newline supergirl , a bit uncomfortable in batgirl s armor , scowled up at the streetlight , her xray vision easily seeing past the glare to where barbara perched atop the light pole .  you said this would only take a minute ! i m getting bored !  newline newline barbara whispered back .  just hold on ! he s only got one more lieutenant left  in the distance , a chainsaw roared to life , and batgirl cracked a rare smile .  see , kara ? i told you . one more , and then we can drag scarecrow back to arkham ! the road is long . they can  t remember where they came from and don  t know where they  re going . all they do is walk . newline newline newline the first is followed by the second , but the second leads . the first is burnt . the sun beats and her face is blistered and charred . she  s never had a hat . the second is beautiful and tanned to perfection . newline newline newline the second stops . then the first . she starts to smoke . she would like to but he can  t run away . it didn  t work the times before so she wo nt try again . she stands and she smokes . the second sits . newline newline newline the first fears the second and she fears the sun and she fears the cancer that is surely propagating somewhere in her exhausted body but fear is old news . the second stands . they carry on . newline newline newline the road is coarse but flat and it never winds . the sweltering heat ripples the horizon and the first thinks she can see something in the distance but it  s never clear and she  s never reached it . newline newline newline sometimes she stops to rest or indulge in a semblance of sleep but the second does not stop with her then . the fear swells and she carries on . newline newline newline in the evening the sun gets low and shadows get long and somehow even over the distance between them a dark outline of the second  s head and shoulders creeps and works its way up the first  s back . usually when she wants to rest . but this , the closest they get to contact , brings with it a surge of fear and she runs . often she passes out and wakes up no less tired . the second is always just as far away . newline newline newline they carry on . newlinethe question does not register to you for a few moments , and the aliens  those ancient , wise beings with large eyes that seem to see everything  wait impassively . you are no philosopher , no psychiatrist . you are a scientist because human biology was always easier to understand than human nature . you look around to see if any of the other scientists and diplomats would like to take the question up themselves , but they all avert their eyes . they had all but mumbled their parts , and while your voice had been clear and even , you could not look at the aliens as you spoke . you still can not look , and so you speak to your shoes .  um , there are a lot ,  you say , and think immediately that that was a mistake .  what i meant to say was ... no , yeah , well , humans have done a lot of bad things . we ve never been really good with dealing with nature , and we re even worse when dealing with each other . human are , ah , greedy and selfish and ... and fearful . yes ! fear is something everyone feels , and when we fear we either stay and fight or we run . some of the most awful things humans have down was because of fear ... fear of the unknown , of the unacceptable , of change ... but humanity is also great because of that fear because ... because there are more important things than fear ,  you say , looking up suddenly at the aliens . all of their stares are concentrated at you , and your legs shake . you look down quickly .  um , well , that s what i think and i ... everyone s opinion is different and ... and , if you d like to talk about human history , we have historians and anthropologists and culturists , so , so , you can ask them questions .  you take a step back , suddenly , and the aliens  gazes follows you before turning to your companions . newline newline  who among you will speak again of the faults of you kind ?  they ask , in unison , their voices echoing in the humans  mind . newline newline the anthropologist steps forward awkwardly .  i ... i will .  newline newline  then begin .  newline newline and so they do . newline newline read em  and weep boys.  he lays down three aces . newline newline the other three players groan and mark rakes in his winnings of seven cigarettes . newline newline  i  m out this round , got ta take a piss.  dan stands and leaves the table . he unbuttons his jumpsuit as he walks . he can  t believe that he lost , trip kings for nothing more than three less smokes . newline newline he smashes his shin into something metal and sharp , maybe a stool . it  s too dark to tell .  who the fuck moved this ? !  he yells and kicks whatever it was across the floor . it skitters across the concrete . he can hear phil bridge shuffling the cards on the steel table . no matter dark it gets he can always find the bucket in the corner , it stinks so bad . newline newline the walls of the room shake subtly and small moats of dusts fall from the ceiling , pebbles bounce off the floor . dan loses his footing slightly and sends a stream of urine up the wall and onto his boots .  fuck.  newline newline  you  re on piss bucket duty now !  mark and steven yell over . newline newline phil deals , the cardboard sliding across the smooth steel .  any idea what time it is ?  he asks . all four men ponder briefly . newline newline  it  s got ta be at least three or four in morning.  mark states .  i can feel it in the air , it  s getting hot out . it  s going to be a long day.  he runs his hands through his short hair .  i wonder if we  ll get to see the sun today.  newline newline dan  s walks back across the room having finishing his business .  i doubt it . it  s been a few months since we saw it last , that cloud cover isn  t going anywhere.  he cracks his shin off something metal again .  fuck sakes ! why don  t we organise this shit ! ?  he kicks the obstruction , this time it doesn  t move . he knows his toe is broken .  can  t see a god damn thing in this place ! keep tripping on things ! i  m gettin fed up !  newline newline  just follow the paths man , chill.  steve tries to calm him down . a deep rumbling shakes the room once more . the glasses in the kitchenette clink together loudly . newline newline  don  t tell me to fuckin  chill !  dan finds his way to the table and sits .  sooner or later one of the roofs gon na come crashing down on our heads and we  ll all be toast like those fools that stayed outside.  newline newline  maybe they made the right choice . i bet they all died in the blast . if we were out there and not in here we  d be gone too , at least we wouldn  t be hungry.  mark state flatly with a sigh . newline newline  we could try and go for a run.  steve suggests . dan swipes the table and sends the cards sprawling across the floor . newline newline  you just don  t get it !  he yells , spit flying from his mouth .  the last time we tried that we made it six steps before we went blind ! i know we  re going to die in here  i  d rather starve with you guys then cook out there.  newline newline  the bombs stopped dropping a few weeks ago . maybe we could make it.  mark struggles to calm his friend . newline newline the air in the room suddenly pressurizes violently . thrumcrack  the sky outside the bunker erupts into flames and scorching light . against all odds the walls hold . the four men jump from their now scalding hot metal seats . the noise outside clams and they  re left with the sound of crackling fire outside the door . newline newline dan exhales slowly .  i guess that settles that.  newline newline  newline newline the war started after everyone thought the oil crisis was over . someone somewhere tripped up and got antsy and all hell broke loose . mark , steve , phil , and dan were constructing a safety shelter for the city to prepare for the fallout . now they wait for the food to run out , and their bodies to give up . newline newline formatting .i can tell you all that some sewers are nt what you think . some are shut down and just for show so that a ... separate species can live there . they usually walk around at night and have groups in sewers , some even live normal lives . basically if you see a person waking around with sunglasses on at night and get a weird vibe do nt approach them . newline newline my story started when i was at work , i was a night janitor in the city and bored with life . i d distract myself with works of fiction and video games . my favorites are zombies  which are real ... covered up by the government , it s confirmed here and not a theory  but i also like stuff like sword art online too . newline newline anyway i was taking out some garbage bags and ran into a woman walking down the ally , she was beautiful . she looked a little like megan fox but her hair was blood red with darker streaks , she was wearing converse , grey jeans , a motley crue tshirt , and had a leather jacket on ... and some sunglasses . newline newline i thought the sunglasses were odd since it was nt light out but did nt look at her too long since someone who looked like me would nt be noticeable , i also did nt want a relationship or anything like that . she looked at me and said i smelled good , which was weird cause i had nt showered that day and there were trash bins around me . i watched her step towards me and looked at her weird asking what she wanted . she did nt say a word and shoved me to the ground and pinned me to the wall saying sorry . newline newline i was confused and she took off her sun glasses , her eye s colored parts  do nt remember the name  were red and the parts that should be white were reddish . she opened her mouth to show fangs , there were two on each side and at that moment i knew what she was . i was nt the type to go out and find death , i either did nt have the balls or was powerful enough to resist ending it ... either one really . but i knew when death came to me i d accept it and not fight so i pulled my collar out and made my neck more accessible which caused her to back away . newline newline  what are you doing ? usually your kind pleads for life unless they re really old or something  she said and i responded with  i m fine with this , go ahead , i m ready and if you are what i think you are a pocket knife i have wo nt do shit so go ahead .  newline newline she looked at me for a second and pulled me up saying  i do nt like what i am , i only feed when i have to and well , magic exists so i want to make a deal with you .  so i asked what she was talking about . newline newline she said  i know how to transfer my curse to you ... well not just the curse it s ... um ... you ll be me and i ll be you  newline newline  like quantum leap or freaky friday ? cause in the first i d see myself when i look down and with the second i d have no physical thing to remind me who i was .  i asked since if i was gon na be someone else i d want it to be all the way and not half way like with leaping . newline newline  the second one , so what do you say ?  she said and i asked  you d give up all that for my body ? also would nt you have to get used to human stuff ? like in that body thief book .  newline newline she laughed and said  trust me , blood is nt just our food , it s everywhere and you ll find out what i mean if you take this deal , it gets annoying after a while .  newline newline i decided to take the deal , it was an interesting thing to see and maybe could be fun . i said yes and she put her hands on my shoulders and started chanting , after a few seconds i passed out and woke up on the ground in between the dumpsters . i looked down at myself and i was definitely her , i also realized my stomach hurt a little . newline newline standing up felt odd and i looked around the alleyway , she was gone but she did leave me my phone in my pocket with a note that said she took the sim card out so i ll have the memory but she d need the stuff like contacts and all , also all the accounts on my phone now are hers and that she left me her passwords on another note . she also left me my pocket knife and cards i had in my old pocket , i read the rest of her note that said her address and if i needed food i could go to the sewers and just use my senses ... but be prepared to see something possibly upsetting . newline newline i did feel really hungry and went where she said , the sewers were dark but i could see perfectly and eventually went towards the smell of food . when i got to a bigger area there was maybe two dozen people that looked like vampires too and i walked up to them . i said i was hungry and they pointed to some people who were hung on the wall . i was pretty shocked and asked who they were , a man said most of them were criminals they caught . this made me feel a little better about it so i went over to the one and the guy told me that person hanging up was about to kill someone for money for drugs . newline newline i nodded and bit into the persons arm while looking over to him and out of the corner of my eye he showed pain , i was about to stop but when i tasted the blood it was ... it was the best thing i ve ever tasted and could nt stop myself . when i was done i let go and the guy looked drained and really pale , no one complained cause there was multiple people and apparently more areas of sewer . i found a bathroom area with a mirror and a leaky pipe that they must ve used to wash off . newline newline i looked at myself  yes we show up in mirrors  and looked at my new eyes up close . there were veins or whatever showing like when i did nt get much sleep and the white parts were almost pinkish , the colored parts were nt solid red but lighter red on the outside and got darker as they went towards the pupil . i looked at her hair looking at the roots and it seemed that red was the natural color too , maybe everything s red cause they only drink blood . i also checked the really trimmed hair ... down there , and it matched so i think i m right . i washed my face off since there was blood everywhere and left the bathroom . newline newline after that i left the sewers and went towards the address she said my new apartment was at , it was an apartment in the city and actually pretty high up . i actually cleaned at the place for about a month so i knew where stuff was and got inside and to her apartment . it was not too messy but there was some clothes on the floor , she had a grunge style so i thought that was awesome . i looked under her collar out of boredom and noticed some blood there , i must not have washed it all off . newline newline there was a nice bathroom so i decided to take an actual bath since i usually took showers , long story short i found some stuff out while doing ... stuff . and i know some things now . one apparently ... down there is bloody all the time ... not like that time of the month but the normal stuff ... is blood , i guess it makes sense with the diet . i also spit on the mirror and yep , that s reddish too , also when i get a cut blood comes out faster than normal but it heals in like 10 seconds without a scar . newline newline i also tried out other tests and i can lift her couch quite easy and run across the room faster than normal . also when i focus i can see the neighbors flowing blood , it s like i m a predator now ... not the alien but like a panther vs a house cat . also i can focus on senses and they re better , like i can hear a guy watching nascar below me when the floors are nt thin . i looked into things on sites that showed this vampire stuff and apparently i do have to pee sometimes but not as much , it depends on what the person consumed . also my heart beats so fast , i m surprised i did nt recognize it before . newline newline i ll probably explore the sewers and town tomorrow , the suns coming up and i do appear to burn really easily so i have to stay inside . i think i might like this new life though , i ve always liked the night more anyway . direct hit captain . signals indicate

now  , let s get to a safer  place  snap as we are transported to what i see as a high hill near a coast i ve never been to . newline newline whoa ... awesome !  i am left in disbelief as my thoughts flooded with awe of what just happened toning down my early confusion . all right , since were here let me introduce myself properly , and you answer me respectfully  he says . i nod in affirmation to his terms . newline newline i am a god , nice to meet you , my name is num , i am the god of random numbers  , he then continues i was sent here to be with you as you are bound to me the day you were born  , think of me as a personal god to you re whims , although i m not your slave per se  , anyway , a god needs a name , what might your calling be ?  newline newline i am dumbfounded . huh  i thought . he says he s a god , well his earlier display proves that  , a random number god huh ? no.. he s hiding something it has to be something greater , like i would believe that that earlier weather disruption was not his  i was thinking profusely . hey ! you re leaving me hanging again !  he yells . oh right my name s james , kind nice to meet you ... i guess ...  as i thought about the logic behind all this . newline newline well james , i ll be with you from now on , well not exactly with you limiting myself . i ve also got an eternity to live like you , so that s that .  , oh and one more thing , before i leave at this moment .  he continues . he s leaving ?  i silently thought . to invoke my presence once more here s a trinket for you to fiddle from time to time  as he throws a necklace towards me . newline newline what s this ?  as i held what seemed to be a cut branch on a string . that s our phone from now on , lose it and you lose me .  he replies . so i threw the branch towards the sea to his surprise and immediate rescue . hey what gives , stop that , just keep it for a moment ! sheesh ! such a troublesome mortal you are !  he scolds . so i keep the trinket once more and place it in my pocket . newline newline to see me , just burn the branch with any flame , i would then know that it s time to be with you again should you need me  he says and continues that is if you need me , just do nt abuse it that much , i m not your nanny if that s what you think  . well this is all hard to take in , i have my own god , he gives me his personal walkie talkie , and now he s going to leave me once more , all of this happening only because i wanted to go home . newline newline argh , alright , i still do nt know what s happening but i guess i ll play along for a while  i reply as i was lost in thought . but before you leave , can i at least get back home ?  . alright  snaps and i m back to that road where i once stood with the being gone now . newline newline remember burn it to see me once more  , just do nt abuse it that much i m not you slave of some sort !  his voice echoes in my mind . newline newline well this is ... new . i ca nt asses this clearly in my mind , but to hell with it all , let s just go home ... . newline newline and that began my adventures  with this being 8 years ago , and well , it s been hell with him . as he s a useless god that freeloads my place whenever i am not in need of anything at all . when you need me ...  my ass ! it s like that god needs me more that i would need him . newline newline hey could you pass the remote  his highness requests as he munches on my doritos . so in favor of mr. highandmighty i do as he pleases . flinging the remote ... headshot ! aw ... fuck , what gives ! i m a god you know ! have some respect !  he groans in pain . a useless god at that !  i reply in disdain . newline newline apparently , i m not alone with this personal god  . there hundreds like me all over the world , of whom have their gods of different attributes , and well ... i ve actually met with one of them ... . newline newline knock knock door creaks newline newline hey ! what s happening !  as the door backs open revealing two individuals . he s abusing me again !  mr. god sobs in the presence of a savior . like hell you deserve humanity in your state  i replied irately . now now , you ve been together for , like what 7 years now ?  , why not just make a long lasting bond of friendship and get over it  our visitors reply . 8 years , do nt remind me , like hell i would enjoy my life with this grouch  i defiantly say , all the while mr. god continues about his business . newline newline well .. it s not our problem , you sort it out with yourself  the other visitor replied unamused . alright lets make dinner !  the first visitor exclaims in excitement . a flash is seen and poof all their brought ingredients was reduced .. no , masterfully remade into cuisines ! awesome  i am silently always left to be in awe as these two have done as always . all the while i look at my god  with disappointed eyes . newline newline well about the gods i was talking about . these are the ones i was referring to . the second visitor is a close acquaintance of mine , although we might not be friends still as i would count , her name is shirley . and this first visitor is a close friend of mine , she s also a god like mine , a god of cuisine keri . all of us met five years ago , and now we re roommates to live the remainder of our college life with whatever comes our way . newline newline  continue this  newline newline i guess i ll save this for now and might update if i feel like it , lest someone else obliges to continue the story about the past of the four individuals of the story . newline newline edits : typos and scenery newlinethis had been a first . waking up at 6 a.m. and feeling refreshed . reenergized . the dismissal of his previous day , and previous life it seemed , had been seemingly processed and conquered thanks to a fantastical night of sleep . his feet hit the ground , his mind recoiled through gracious scenarios and mental states until his body and mind caught up to the same page : the realities of here and now hit gently , massaging the satisfied feeling he initially woke up with . the shower was a shower simply put  not the usual excuse to delight in steam and heat . his insides , his soul , felt warm upon awakening . this shower was just gravy . newline looking back upon the meditative state his mind fell into , he consciously peered into the contingency which his dreams lay , the ultimate feast of desire and subconscious fantasy which the creative manifestations  yes , we are all creative , despite many a  singular  feeling  engendered within his mind . newline   they will never know  newline   hm ?  newline   nobody will ever know what you dream of , only if you will their reception of such  newline   i know  i replied meekly , implicitly wanting to imply sonorous intonations to such a pure figure as if to show earnesty . this voice , no man or woman so far as he could perceive , rose from nature s intentions . in this life , the powerful affect and the lesser are affected , as so with any chain of hierarchy . in this case , the powerful was nature , the culmination of grass , trees , wind , clouds , visualized by perpetual ocean tide gracefully begging the human mind s tranquility , together was the other . newline the other being the being , the life which galvanized this voice , that seemed a part of emperica . newline goosebumps ran up and down his flesh for reasons greater than the sensation of hot water . newline he was now within his own trance . the glass chiseled walls now his secure castle walls . newline back to the dream . the sun was descending into a distant corridor of a forest illuminated by a narrow glistening stream . walking upon , or floating , above the stream filled felt right upon memory . walking next to , or floating over  rhyme or reason ?  he noticed the stream , filled with koi fish , led somewhere sacred subconsciously pure and sacred . he came upon an opening of bright green , smooth brush went away as if to invite him to the crystal clear waters of the stream s conception . a pond lay as mysterious as beautiful underneath a rock ridge covered with bronze rock that barely caused the pinch of sun to make the whole scene visible in fainting rays . a waterfall ... newline wait , i do nt remember any noise being made by the waterfall newline a waterfall silently poured the pure substance into the pond that fed the stream as he crept into the scene . a very , very odd feeling that felt an essence of reality and doubta first in this subconscious mecca pulled his attention backward back toward the origin of his dream . newline looking still into his shortterm memory bank , he finally greeted his pure thoughts with an overlay of intuition ... newline wait , are nt the beginnings of dreams irretrievable ?  newline his curiosity dictated else wise , though , and he continued his venture into his dreams . newline looking back , he burdened his memory with the chore of creating the exact image and sensation anew , successfully . the vision came to him as quickly as lightning strikes the ground . newline the voice of the pond stopped and his mother appeared , beckoning his name on the path which he had just came from . his mother , dressed in her usual mauve silk night gown , called over and over his name , smiling when his glace finally met her eyes . her smile , however met no instinctive happiness , no sense of contentment upon his recollection of the dreamincident . he immediately was inclined to look back at the heaven which presented itself to him by pure volition of desire . newline  this is it !  he thought of the emotionprovoking scene at the end of his journey . newline he looked back at his mother for confirmation of righteous action , only to find her face saddened and tearstained . newline  i need you , emperica  . newline  why ?  newline  we need you , emperica . your family ! just , just , just , everyone !  her stare never snapped and their eyes locked for what seemed hours . newline  why ? ? ? ?  rebutted emperica . newline he looked back at the nativity scene . still there , yet less important to him , it seemed . something in his dreamcharacter s mind told his dreamcharacter that he must go back , although his mother may no longer be calling him . emperica looked upon the waterfall , pond , incandescent rock , clouds , and harmless growth surrounding the scene lacking the initial immaculate feeling . his incorrigibly selfish self could not shake the notion that this must be the place where he makes his life turn for the better . he waited . he waited for what seemed like days . looking back whilst still in his newly acclimated kingdom , he tried unsuccsessfully to remember the thoughts which ultimately urged his decision . after looking forth and back , back and forth into the designated paradise and reality , he returned to where he felt no longer destined for , despite his horrible urges and perverse inclination to venture into the paradise he was headed for . newline he woke up that morning , as mentioned , feeling great . that creeping feeling of loneliness deserted him . breakfast was eaten with great hunger . the cold , frozen grass was seen with new light that somehow pierced through the december wisconsin sky.the bedroom s radio played music , but emperica heard none of it . he was content , in his mind , with his life . newline he called his mother , who was overjoyed to hear his voice , and emperica found that for the first time in too long , he called his mother for no reason other than because he wanted to talk to her . newline his life did not magically become amazing , he did not win anything , and he certainly did not tell anyone of his dream . newline however , emperica had seen quite literally the other side . he continually used this juxtaposition of lifedream experience to rejuvenate his spirit and his own wisdom to further his relationships and perception on life . newline emperica had now something to compare life too , for emperica had seen death . newlinedanny whimpered as he held his hands over his head . tears rolled down his face only to be caught by his untamed beard . newline newline  hey , hey , hey , wait a minute , you can  t do this !  jack pleaded as he put himself between the gun and danny . newline newline  why the hell do you care ? we  ve done this dozens of times before ,  dom said , still holding out the gun ,  you know the rules.  newline newline  i know him . he was my friend before well , everything . look , i  m just asking that this one time you spare a trespasser . please.  newline newline dom considered danny for a moment . danny  s eyes were closed tightly and he trembled as the conversation around him continued .  you find anything in his bag , eddie ?  newline newline  nothing.  eddie threw the bag at jack  s feet .  the guy has a torch with no batteries , a halfempty bottle of water and a couple of tins of beans . nothing major.  newline newline dom raised his eyebrows . newline newline  he can be useful , i know it.  jack implored . newline newline  and what if he  s not , jack ?  dom yelled .  then he  s just another mouth to feed . we  re low on food as it is , we  re not about to let another guy come in.  newline newline  well then we can just let him go , just don  t kill him , i  m begging you.  newline newline  we can  t let him go . he knows where our camp is , he knows our faces . who  s to say he doesn  t have a camp of his own filled with people who could come back and kill us ?  dom asked .  we have these rules for a reason . i  m sorry but we  ve got to do this.  newline newline  if you  re gon na kill him then you  re gon na have to kill me too.  jack said , staring defiantly at dom . newline newline dom sighed , rubbing his brow with his free hand . he looked into jack  s eyes with disappointment .  you  ve not seen him for eight months , man.  newline newline jack responded with silence . dom turned to mark at his right hand side and nodded . mark stepped forward . newline newline  i  m sorry , jack.  mark said . he threw a punch at jack , throwing him off balance and sending him to the floor . mark stood behind jack , grabbing his arms and pinning them behind his back . he pulled jack to his feet , giving dom a free shot at danny . newline newline  don  t do this , dom !  jack shouted as he cocked the pistol . newline newline  no ! please , wwwait a minute !  danny held his hands out in front of the gun , breathing rapidly .  i can help you , ii know where you can get fuel.  newline newline dom paused , still holding the gun at danny  s head .  you  ve got thirty seconds . start talking.  newline newline  there  s a gas station . it  s only a couple of miles away . it  s  newline newline  across the road from the local school , i know where you mean.  eddie finished .  we raided that place a while back . there  s no fuel there.  newline newline  not in the pumps ,  danny said ,  the station has an underground bunker , they  ve got fuel reserves in there just in case the pumps would ever run out.  newline newline  how do you know this ?  newline newline  i used to work in one before the outbreak.  danny quickly rubbed his hands through his long black hair .  i can take you there and show you where it is . you  ll be free to take as much of the fuel as you want . just let me live , please.  newline newline dom looked around at mark and eddie . there was a moment of silence as he weighed up the options . jack looked at danny , whose eyes darted from man to man as he wiped the sweat from his forehead . newline newline  alright ,  dom put the gun back in his holster ,  fine . take us to this bunker and we  ll let you go . mark , let go of jack . we  ll get some gear and then set off.  newline newline mark released jack from his grip . jack helped danny to his feet as the others returned to the tents . newline newline  jack , fucking hell , am i glad  newline newline  danny , is this real ?  jack said urgently . newline newline  i know , i didn  t think i  d see anybody else i know after what happened.  newline newline  no , the gas station story . is it real ?  newline newline  of course it  s real.  newline newline  alright , that  s something at least.  newline newline  what  s the problem ? i  m alive aren  t i ?  danny looked confused . newline newline  you  ve just bought yourself an hour . as soon as you show them this place , they  re going to kill you anyway . i swung open the stall door and upon realising my error immediately tried to close it again . too late . newline newline  stephen is that you ?  newline newline yes it was me . she knew it was me , i knew it was me and soon enough the entire office would know it was me ... in the women s bathroom . i eased the door open . newline newline  oh . hi tammy . hi sarah  was about all i could muster . sarah returned to her makeup . newline newline  come here often ?  tammy quipped , her face as stern as always . newline newline  haha yeahno , never !  i quickly corrected myself as i recalled i was talking to a manager . you never quite knew where you stood with tammy . she was always making witty comments but i had not once seen her laugh . unlike mark who seemed to laugh so much it was a wonder he did any actual work . newline newline  mark ... dared me to come in here  i blurted . i could see here weighing up the situation , her gaze piercing through my confident demeanour to the trembling fool within . my heart was pounding on my ribcage . i sensed she could hear that too . newline newline  mark s an idiot . get out before i decide i did see you in here  she said turning to face the mirror once more . i did nt need a second invitation .the lightning blinds me for a quick second as it flashes quickly across the dark grey sky . strange weather for the past few weeks now . i got the call from lloyd back at h.q about a car accident , this one was a little different to your average crash , though . newline newline newline newline i turn on the radio to

collide .the robot sat crouched in the rain , eyes pulsing a diffused blue . marceline drew up her hood and went to meet him . newline newline hello , argo .  newline newline hello , marceline .  the robot trilled and held out a black , silicone palmed hand . three beetles crawling patiently across the artificial skin . i have found some beetles .  newline newline so i see .  she said crouching beside him . newline newline would you like to watch them with me for a while ?  newline newline wellwe ll have to go soon .  she looked out across the grounds , adding and it s raining  . newline newline yes .  the robot said . it s because the world is sad .  newline newline are you sad , argo ?  she asked . newline newline the robot nodded . newline newline that s understandable , argo .

team . in fact , it was only because the teachers took attendance every morning that his friends somehow managed to remember him . newline newline a plain boy in plain clothes from a plain background . newline newline his family was unremarkable , too . a father working in a canning factory in a seaside town , commuting daily at dawn and arriving back in time for supper . his mother , a stayathome mom , made supper as john did his homework on the dining table . they used to speak of mundane things during supper : the weather , work , school . sometimes his parents would speak to each other about work , and drowned by the buzzing of the tv , they would forget he was at the table too . newline newline john would slip away to his room unnoticed . newline newline at twenty five , john was working at a small company , commuting from his childhood home . his parents did nt mind , as he was barely ever home . he could nt live alone with his wages , and he did nt have anyone else to live with . john was no longer in touch with his school friends , and he barely hung out with his colleagues . in fact , tonight , they forgot to invite him again . newline newline it was nine p.m. , and john was just finishing up his report . a sudden flash of light illuminated his window , making john look up . the rain had turned from a drizzle to a fullblown storm . he stood up from his work desk , ready to submit his report to his boss , but found an empty room . newline newline again , he sighed . newline newline by nine thirty , john was waiting at the bus stop to go home . he held on tightly to his umbrella , swaying in the wind . the bus  headlights came into view around the corner , and soon john was aboard the bus . newline newline as usual , the friday night route into town was filled with all sorts . workers , drunk with their colleagues . or couples on dates , returning home in each others  arms . younger ones , coming in barely in time for their curfew . their chatter remained unbothered by the sound of rain and thunder , leaving john in his silence . newline newline even today , the very last day of his life of had been unremarkable . newline newline at ten thirty p.m. , the rescuers came to the wreckage of the bus . after weeks of heavy rain , a landslide had smashed the bus halfway through the railing . men in uniform came with stretchers , carrying the living and the dead alike out of the wreck . newline newline when he regained consciousness , john found himself stuck on a branch . the last thing he had remembered was being thrown out the window of the bus . john looked ahead , finding the horizon obscured by storm clouds . he could hear the waves crashing under him , and the distant sounds of sirens and shouts . newline newline over here , he wanted to say . but nothing came out . newline newline john tried to wiggle himself free , pushing his arms against the branch . he managed to lift himself up a little , but he could nt feel his legs . he looked down , finding nothing . newline newline his legs were gone . newline newline half his torso was gone . newline newline what ? he thought . am i dead ? newline newline john panicked and reached down with his arms , feeling down his body . nothing , there was nothing below the waist . he felt his heart beat quickly for a second , then nothing . his heart had stopped beating too . john realized that he had stopped breathing . newline newline i m dead . he told himself . or this is nt real . newline newline in time , john heard the sirens fade out . the sun soon came out from behind the hills , illuminating john and the sea in a soft orange glow . he stared at the horizon , then looked down at what remained of his body . the sunlight confirmed what he thought was his delusion to be real . newline newline john was most definitely a corpse , an incomplete one at that , but he still had his mind . john felt alive , but he was sure that he should nt be . newline newline he stared again at the horizon . the cliff loomed over him , an unscalable surface for a man with legs , much more so more a man with almost no body left . besides , what would people say upon finding a halftorso that was still alive ? newline newline john chuckled at the scenario , imagining himself starting a zombie panic . and yet there he was , a sample of a true living dead . newline newline how did this happen ? he thought many times during the weeks after . is nt anyone coming to get me ? newline newline john was nt much of a believer of the afterlife , but he definitely thought there was going to be an end . perhaps a death to come fetch you , or separate you from your body as you disintegrate into nonexistence . john found himself troubled by the inconclusiveness of his  death  . newline newline first came the birds , pecking at his open torso and his body . they came for his eyes too , but john did his best to keep the shut . newline newline after all , he was half a body stuck on a branch with nothing to do other than watch the horizon . newline newline after a few days , another storm came , and the winds threw john into the water . he could feel himself hitting the sharp rocks underneath the waves , cutting him apart even more . the waves threw him from rock to rock , across the sand and the pebbles at the bottom . newline newline only little more than john s head made it to a stop when it was finally wedged between two coarse rocks . inside the sea , the water was loud in his ears , and john could feel his flesh rotting faster . the fishes came for john , biting his skin and what was left of his flesh . newline newline in the murky waters , john saw nothing but slivers of light on the waves above him . newline newline soon enough , nothing remained of john . another storm had come , breaking apart his bones and smashing him to pieces . john s consciousness faded then , like a light that had finally flickered off , and john was finally sent into the dark . newline newline john lived a completely unremarkable life . it was so unremarkable , that in death that he became remarkable , as death had completely forgotten about him . somewhere , a name crossed itself from death s list . newline newline death was lucky that john remained unseen until his body disintegrated . after all , who knew how furious god would be if he knew death had almost started a zombie apocalypse , again . newline newline newline newline newlinerory seated the helmet on his head , connected the power cable for the personal ac system , and then slipped the asbestos lined gloves onto his hands before reaching to grasp the thick brass rings set in the large metal door and swinging it wide . he poked his head through and surveyed the next room . he could nt reach the light switch from where he stood , but the room was redly lit from below by its own thick , bubbling floor . newline newline the sofa , coffee table , and armchair were all still there , each protected by glowing runes of frost which prevented them from bursting into flames  or melting in the case of the cast iron coffee table  . but they were all too far away to be of any immediate help . they were bunched in the opposite side of the room , bobbing and turning slightly . they appeared to have been gradually swept across the room by the slow moving fiery current as it travelled from the hallway toward the kitchen . rory realized he would have to be daring . newline newline fortunately he had prepared for this . the nightly forecast had called for a 75  chance of lava transmutation today , so he had gotten ready last night before he had climbed into his hammock to sleep suspended from the ceiling . he had hoisted the nightstand on a rope and hung it from the lighting fixture . the bed would have been better , but it was too heavy and would have pulled the fixture down . at least he had been saved the trouble of making the bed this morning : it , of course , was a charred ruin by now . newline newline so carefully testing the weight of the nightstand in his arms , he made his best guess as to the right amount of force to use , and then tossed the nightstand halfway between the door and the cast iron bookshelves . it landed with a strange noise that was half thump and half plop , and then sank slightly into the gooey , blazing surface until it reached the more solid subsurface of clay over the bedrock base beneath . the legs of the nightstand almost immediately caught fire , and rory realized he did nt have too much time to think this next step through . newline newline that was probably a blessing , since if he spent too much time thinking about it , he might very well chicken out . so instead , he took a running start and flung himself across the gap then landed atop the nightstand with his arms outstretched . as soon as he hit , the whole structure listed slightly as one leg sank lower than the others , and he flailed his arms in a circular motion to recover his wobbly balance . the momentum change shifted the large clumsy bubble helmet he wore . it slipped forward and smacked him on the back of his head , but he did nt let it distract him . he did nt dare . newline newline on a roll now , he bent at the knees and prepared himself to spring . he needed to be quick : flames creeping up the side of the nightstand were already becoming visible over the sides . he would have to make a nice high standing jump to clear them , in fact . a moment later , he did so , and grabbed for the bookcase . looking back over one shoulder , he bid a silent farewell to the remnants of the rapidly disintegrating nightstand behind him . then he shimmied along the bookcase , which fortunately was mounted firmly to the wall , allowing himself some reasonably stable climbing for a short while . newline newline when rory reached the far end , he had a decision to make . he let go with one hand so he could pivot to look at the cluster of furniture near the eastern wall . the armchair was closest , but it was such a narrow target . the coffee table made a nice long landing pad , but he was nt sure he liked the cockeyed way it was tilted toward the center of the room . if he landed wrong and could nt recover balance fast enough no , it was going to have to be the sofa . newline newline he scrambled up to the very top shelf of the bookcase . luckily , his wife had insisted on the apartment with twelve foot ceilings . at the time , all rory had thought about was the extravagant rent , and how his wife had expensive tastes . now , it gave him some reassuring head clearance as he crouched atop the bookshelf and prepared to spring . he angled for his target of choice and bobbed up and down a few times preparing himself , then leaped ! newline newline his ankle hit the nearest arm of the sofa , and his work shoes  not really designed for this kind of activity  caught the fabric badly , sending him into a forward roll . luckily , this just demonstrated that he had made the right choice in selecting the sofa , because the roll slammed him up against the back of the sofa , absorbing most of the momentum of his tumble . it would leave a bruise , but that was nt so bad , considering the alternative . newline newline now almost home free . he rose , dusted himself off , and loped across the sofa until he was within a few short feet of the door to the kitchen . he gave a mighty hop and grabbed hold of the door frame with his arms , letting his legs swing around the frame and sure enough , there was a row of kitchen chairs , each with a chilly blue rune of frost , neatly lined up , leading to the table . god bless mary ! newline newline rory nimbly hopped from chair to chair until he reached the table , then sat down upon it in a lotus position . he took some deep , relaxing breaths to break the tension while the table bobbled slightly in the increasingly sluggish current . then he turned to his wife mary , who was squatting on the countertop next to the stove , calmly tending a frying pan from which wafted a heavenly aroma . newline newline  i made us a couple of omelettes ,  she said calmly in the hellish sheen formed by the lava light mixing with the reddishgolden glow of sunrise .  the recipe your dad gave us .  newline newline  the one with cayenne and ghost peppers ?  he asked . newline newline  yep . almost finished . and the coffee should be ready in a minute . you want to get a couple of mugs out ? i ca nt really leave this .  newline newline rory pushed himself up , walked to the edge of the table , and stepped easily onto the countertop beside the sink . he had to duck down to reach into the cabinet and pulled out two mugs . he made two cups of black coffee and returned to the table with them as mary finished up the omelettes . newline newline but before they could eat , he heard the distinctive arooooga ! horn of mick s airship pulling up outside .  uh oh ,  he told mary .  mick s early .  newline newline  tell him to wait ! you have to eat ,  she told him . newline newline  sorry hon . you know how he is on lava days . no patience whatsoever . all the updraft plays havoc with the airship and it takes twice as long to get anywhere . i got ta go . i ll just take a coffee with me .  newline newline  well , that s just fine !  she said irritably .  i ll feed your breakfast to the fire elementals out back . maybe theyll appreciate it .  there was no point in saying anything . rory just told himself he d better keep his mouth shut and it would blow over by evening when she calmed down . it was the heat , he reminded himself . everyone was irritable on a lava day . newline newline taking his coffee mug in one hand , he opened the window , squeezed through , and grabbed the rope ladder hanging down from mick s airship . he held onto the ladder as the airship ascended , and took his time to finish his coffee in one long gulp before tossing the mug into the flames that were consuming his lawn then waved to mary before climbing up into the gondola . god how he hated lava days ! newlinedude , i would love feedback . newline newline the only thing though , is if you re a dick about it , then it wo nt be taken seriously . newline newline for example  if i was the individual you were talking about in the post , and you commented  this was pretty great for the first couple of paragraphs , but personally , here s what i would ve done insert advice  then your advice would be taken to heart and noted for future writings . newline newline

pushed the whore beside me out of my bed as i stood up .  get the fuck out of my house ,  i mumbled . she scurried out , throwing her clothes on as she did . as i walked to the trudged my way to the washroom , i looked into the living room . there was my wife , alone on the couch . she must ve gotten home from work after i got back from the bar . when i got to the toilet , i lifted the seat , leaned my hand against the wall , and received almost immediate pleasure . piss splashed the already moldy walls as i relieved myself . i walked over to the sink and wiped the grime off the mirror . i

this has some really good detail . also , the units you will want to use will depend on the point of views expressed in the book . if , say , the perspective is that of a commanding officer in a russian force , they might have the same organizational system but different words  because they speak different languages  . now , because you re looking for units for heaven and hell s forces , their is a chance that the language barrier is irrelevant . if your prospective is from someone omniscient  god , a narrator , etc .  then the units will only serve as good synonyms to avoid rereading the same term over and over . if that s the case , i would go with roman military units , as the rise of catholicism went hand in hand with the roman empire . newline you can keep it fresh without

of water . everywhere that i can see , i see water . it  s not very deep , just a little above my ankles . i walk , but there  s this feeling that i know this place . something tells me that i  ve been here before . that once i could have called this place newline newline  damn , now that was a weird dream  . i look at my clock : 5:46 . still 5 hours until i have to wake up for classes . i try to get back to sleep , but i can  t shake that feeling . i knew that place . newline newline fire everywhere . and then air . life , death and everything in between . i feel an eternal peace , and i can reach every single part of the universe with one thought . i master time and space just like that . i create matter . i cease to exist and at the same time i come into existence . i create and destroy . kill and bring life . i am known in every single conscience in the universe . my powers extend far beyond the limit of this universe . i can sense others like me . i try to reach to them and they respond in the same manner . we don  t need words or something as mundane as thoughts . we are far beyond the abilities of what can be described with words . we are the darkness , the light , the life and death . the alpha and omega . newline newline an alarm goes off .  fuck ! i overslept !  newline newline i barely grab my clothes and start to run . what was that dream about ? i mean , i still feeleverything lingering inside me . am i awake ? as i start contemplating that possibility , i trip and fall . it hurts a lot , so that means i  m awake . newline newline i think . newlineafter she passes away , i never go looking for her until approximately twenty five years have drifted by . although time and age does not suffice in explaining my age , a simple and blunt adjective is  old  . i am old , around twenty centuries old to be exact but i have retained my twenty five year old youthful physique since the day i was cursed with immortality . because of this , i let her path be guided by her parents and i allow time to let her develop some individuality . i never intervene while she matures , that is not my place . newline newline i have been reluctant to fall into love since i gained immortality . other than giving into my physical desires , relationship building was never something i sought after . that all i changed when i met her , the woman who shattered this notion that i , the man who never can die , was not worthy of love . now , i spend my days searching for her after her rebirth from death . it has been twenty five years since she left my arms and now , she is a woman again in a different century and i can not wait to see her . newline newline my footsteps gently imprint the snow as i walk through the park . i can feel my fingers fidgeting under the warmth of my wool gloves . my heart dances to the same nerves , fluttering while i walk the narrow sidewalk of the aged park . not a single soul is in sight , just like the past five times i have found her . there is a sort of magic when we cross paths for the first time , an unexplained force that can always be felt . she never remembers it but i do . i never forget . newline newline i approach my snow filled imprints , the marks picking up where i started . i see a cab pull up and stop directly in front of the park entrance . a young woman steps out of the car , adoring a vibrant red scarf and knee high boots , she stands and looks up at the snowflakes that fall from the silvery clouds above . i squint my eyes to focus and without delay , i notice her strawberry blonde hair flowing out of the thickly knitted bonnet that dresses her head . newline newline my heart races and the familiar feeling in the air thickens when i start to walk in her direction . she looks down from the sky and our eyes lock together . i approach her foolishly , acting as if she may recognize me . of course , she does not but still , she stands like she is waiting on me to say something . newline newline  hello , beautiful snow , is nt it ?  , i nervously ask , an empty feeling in my stomach overwhelms me . newline newline she gazes at me intently , her pupils bouncing around taking in every feature and angle of my face . newline newline  yes , it is very beautiful . this park has been my favorite since i was a little girl . i like to walk it in the winter so i can enjoy it all to myself . not many people go walking in the snow ... obviously  , she says , her face slightly blushed from saying so much to someone she just met . newline newline  that is why i came here ! this is my getaway and it holds a very special place in my heart . let s just say that this park carries many fond memories .  , i say , looking around the park , remembering the countless times we have walked it together in the years past . newline newline the words flee from me when i try to continue the conversation . i gamble , hoping my mistake will not scare her off . newline newline  i hope this does not sound creepy , but would you want to walk it with me ? i mean , i know it s creepy to even say i hope this does not sound creepy but i  i do nt really know ...  , i start to stutter , my face burning now from embarrassment . newline newline she interrupts me and lets out a laugh that melts my insides , it sounds exactly like it should . sweet and soft , and tapers off into a beautiful smile . the same way it has been for nearly five hundred years . newline newline  i would like that . you seem like a nice enough guy  , she says , her appearance noticeably relaxed . newline newline she takes a few steps near me and we now stare at each other , nearly nose to nose . after a few seconds , her eyes widen and her jaw descends in disbelief . newline newline  you.. you are ...  , she says , the words stumbling out of her mouth . newline newline yes , please remember sarah . say my name and you will remember everything , i think to myself , my heart thumping through my chest . newline newline  you are that guy from the cheerios commercial ! the one who sings the jingle ! are nt you ! ?  , she yells in excitement , her finger pointing directly in my face , almost touching the tip of my nose . newline newline i let out a heavy sigh and smack my hand to my forehead . newline newline  oh , that guy !  , i say back , acting like i have the slightest clue as to what she is talking about .  no ! but i get that all the time !  newline newline her shoulders slump in disappointment , her giddy smile quickly fading . newline newline  oh shucks , well you look just like him !  , she says back . newline newline we start to walk slowly , frequenting the same path we have fallen in love on so many times before . i must say , this was the first time in five hundred years i actually believed she might recognize me immediately . newline newline oh well , i guess there are worse things my face could have been associated with besides some jingle singing cheerio s guy . newline newline per the usual routine , i will have to work at making her remember . newline newline but it does not matter because i will love every second of it .at the strike of immense pain he clutched his gut , where not too long before a knife had been embedded . all at once his body collapsed toward the steaming pavement . the torrential rain shattered the world around him , cleansing the blood from his gut but never from his hands . newline newline ... newline newline the paintchipped door creaked and a prism of light broke into the apartment . cans and glass bottles littered the floor , trailing all around . the place reeked of enough alcohol to render a liver useless . a bandaged hammond sat melancholic in his bed by the window , which shuttered yet another downpour  they never seemed to stop these days , and he held a drink in hand . newline newline the dark figure approached . newline newline hammond gazed , unfazed by the intruder .  hello , again .  he said calmly , monotone . newline newline the figure halted , and did not respond . newline newline  you know , in the past year i ve had many , many , many fatal injuries .  newline newline nothing . newline newline his blood began to bubble and his voiced tinged with anger ,  but i just wo nt die . you re always there !  newline newline the figure regained footing and loomed closer . newline newline  you caused me all this pain ! why do you let me suffer ? just fucking kill me ! do it !  newline newline the dark hooded figure grabbed hammond by the throat and strangled the life out of him . after the breathing stopped , he took his hands off , almost as though he were disgusted . hammond s corpse fell into the bed , rather ungracefully . the figure stepped back and knelt down , reaching under the bed and sliding a box out from under it . he knew that hammond always kept it there . every hammond did as of late . newline newline within the box was a noose . the hooded man tied the rope to the ceiling fan and hung himself with it . but he did not die .i was having a bad day . that bad day had turned into a horrible night and by the time i got home i wanted to take a shot , smoke a joint and pass the fuck out . i had spent all of the last twentyfour hours sober . and that had nt helped the day be any less of a waste . newline newline the real problem was always women . i had sworn them off , but millions of years of male evolution had kept me going back , like some beduin tribesman to an oasis in the desert . and everytime it felt i got it reprimanded for the pilgrimage . newline newline anyway , today had started in a hopeful lie . i had woke up to a wonderful woman name susan . as i had opened my eyes , her mouth had woken my member . it had been a damned site better than a buzzing alarm clock . but ... but then i got a call to go into work , by another women . my boss judy . newline newline i woefully left the naked susan on my bed and climbed into a stiff suit . i pecked her on the mouth before i left . i grabbed a breakfast bar , made a cup of coffee , and then was out the door . it was a sunday , of course , so no traffic . newline newline i pulled into work at 9 a.m. and was one of three cars in the parking lot . i walked in , sat at my desk and started to type . email , report , email , email , report , memo , break , coffee , cigarette , email , email ... newline newline i was still excited about susan , though . until she texted . newline newline hey , its been fun , but i m not feeling us being long term , she wrote . newline newline then why the fuck did you blow me this morning ?  , i asked . newline newline pity mostly , she shot back . newline newline i did nt say anything back . really , it was just one more slight in a sea of slights , so fuck her . i went back to emails . newline newline it was about noon and the thought of lunch occurred to me . i got up , walked out of my cubicle into the hallway and smacked into a scene that make me feel more that a little terrified . newline newline judy , in her usual black dresssuit was standing in front of john , a cowroker i rarely talked to . it would have been normal but for the shotgun she had pointed at his chest . not a lot of talking was happening . john was looking a little tiered , but oddly aloof . judy looked crazed . and i felt like shitting myself . newline newline note : newline i have to go to work , i m getting to the closet part . ill be back !  newlineedit : this was a response to prompt from awhile ago , about spending new years eve with a ropedup homosexual burglar after losing your job , girlfriend , cat , and best friend . does anyone remember that one ? newline newline                                                              newline newline  what do you think this is all about ?  i asked the burglar . randolph was his name . he was tied up in my kitchen . newline newline he grunted a little . newline newline  ah , yes . right . my apologies.  i stooped , and removed the gag from his mouth . newline newline he exhaled a breath .  what do you mean ? what  s what about ?  newline newline  you know . what is life about ? is there a best way to live it , what is it , and why should we even try ?  newline newline after a moment , he said ,  that  s a big question.  newline newline  i don  t think people spend as much time as they should answering the big questions.  newline newline  why are you asking me , anyway ?  the burglar  s tone was strained . his arms and legs were uncomfortably bound together behind his back , and he struggled to find a good position . newline newline i sighed . my best friendthe one i would ask the biggest questions ofhad been dead since september . i had lost my job the previous week , and just this morning my girlfriend called to tell me that things were over . this burglar was my last friend in this mortal realm . and to think that , mere minutes ago , we hadn  t even been friends at all ! he had been trying to take my tv ! it  s a funny old world , isn  t it ? newline newline  well ,  i told him ,  i  ve got nobody left . my friends , my family , my work , and my catall gone.  newline newline he shifted , and gave a sympathetic sigh . or perhaps it was out of discomfort . i pulled up a chair and sat down next to him , gazing out the window longingly at the people gathered in time square . we remained in silence for a time . newline newline  i think that life is largely about one  s family.  i simply placed this thought out into the air  i expected no response . newline newline the burglar snorted . newline newline  you disagree , randolph ?  newline newline he shook his head , then contorted his neck to look up at me .  my family never accepted menot after they found i was gay . especially not gran . gran resolved never to acknowledge me again . it became clear to the family that they wouldn  t be able to invite both her and i to any gathering . well , christmas just went by , andthey decided to inviteher , rather than me.  newline newline  oh , randolph , you have my deepest sympathies.  silence ensued for a moment or two .  at least take solace in the fact that this withering , dilapidated , insufferable old bag will soon be dead . she will return to dust , and any mark she made upon this world will , in time , be obscured by the great and unstoppable force of chaos . she will be swallowed up by obscurity and everyone will forget her namea fate which ultimately awaits us all.  newline newline  yes ,  he sniffled .  i do take some solace in that.  newline newline  we must simply hope that the old die soon enough for us to enjoy our own lives.  newline newline  you  re right.  newline newline  so are you . perhaps this really isn  t much about family after all . but then what ?  newline newline this question was not answered . the two of us simply sat in somber silence , watching as the ball dropped and the crowed counted backward from ten . well , randolph couldn  t see it from his position on the kitchen floor , but i watched . newline newline  fancy this ,  i said .  me , on new years eve , with no one to spend it with other than a ropedup robber.  i chuckled .  do you have any resolutions , randolph ?  newline newline  any what ?  newline newline  new years resolutions . what do you plan to do differently next year ?  newline newline he pontificated upon it for a moment , and then smiled  for the first time  and replied ,  i am definitely going to rob less people of less stuff.  newline newline a tear formed at the corner of my eye at these words . here , i had only known him for an hour or so , and already i was so very proud of him ! what a commendable resolution for him to make . newline newline  what a commendable resolution for you to make !  newline newline  thank you . do you have any resolution ?  newline newline i thought for a moment . he really had warmed my heart with his sudden and courageous repentance from crime . newline newline  my resolution , randolph , is to be more forgiving.  newline newline at those words , i helped disentangle my new friend from his bindings . i felt we experienced a special connection  as if , from our independent solitudes , we were rescued , drawn by the inexplicable , beautiful twine of fate that winds through all things . it had seen us in our misery , two fragile vessels , carelessly cracked by an inconsiderate world , and it brought us together so that we might shed our mutual weaknesses and see our strengths more sharply than ever , gaining the bravery we needed to stake a claim on this fierce , unloving , tragic , misfortunate , crazy , funny ol  world . newline newline and that is the story of how i lost my television set . newlineall the bermensch had known for 10,000 years of time without beginning was harmony and finally they began to miss humanity , the rope tying them to the tier . newline newline they were perfect and different and lovely through revelation and through suicide , something uniting them i still do nt quite understand . suicide shot them to the moon and through a singularity and to another place to call home . nirvana , pure land , heaven . newline newline it began with one and it shattered the afterlife all the tier on earth had so much faith in . one life looked down and felt mistaken and managed to spring down and out of the ground he saw immeasurities away . newline newline the angel walked up a flight of stairs into the bunker of his pastlife , already in love with it s wife like it did before it went on to it s new home . newline newline it was sad and it was happy and it was all porridge and it knew it had made a mistake in coming back but it did nt care , perfection was something it knew it d want but not yet . it saw where it all ended and knew how honey and love and bliss and beauty felt in the gut but it still felt that something was left behind . newline newline maybe it should ve came down as something simple like a dog or a cat or a cockroach , but it had crimes to pay for : not a matter of truth but a matter of dignity , something it lost somewhere between earth and heaven and found again too late . newline newline the angel stood up and remembered it s name and what it had done and why it returned . it did something too shattering to leave without fixing . newline newline the angel walked out the bunker and called on the others to petal the world and fill cracks in the lives it left and found love cast in something more downtoearth than before , all the evil it had become and inflicted eons ago went away . newlineare you sure you wouldnt rather play chess ? death replied newline i like chess newline newline  no , i hereby challenge you to pokmon battle for my life  newline newline death sighed . he hated it when they were difficult . newline newline fine . standard rules or no restrictions ? newline newline  no restrictions , far more fun . now , pass me my gameboy please  newline newline oh no , it does nt work like that . there is a slight sparkle in the indigo supernovae pinpricks of deaths eyes that if you did nt know better indicated a certain level of mischief . newline please , name your three pokmon team for me newline newline the man was nt sure where this was going but hesitantly he called out  blastoise , charizard , venusaur , i chose you !  newline newline ah , the original three . how nice . raichu , rapidash and mewtwo , i choose you newline newline  here , you ca nt have mewtwo , he s a legendary !  newline newline i rather think i can . you did specify there would be no restrictions did you not ? newline newline  bugger . fine well , what now ?  newline newline now , we begin . newline newline the air around shimmers for a second then shifts ... to reveal an open grass plateau , a sheer drop on all sides , no where to run , nowhere to hide . just the two figures facing off at opposite sides . newline at his waist the man felt a curious weight . wrapped around the hospital gown was a wide leather belt with 6 clips on . three empty , the other three holding a pokeball each . a quick touch of each revealing its occupant in the sudden flash of an image in the mind . newline newline if youre quite ready we ll begin newline newline death threw his first pokeball newline the dying man threw his . newline newline a raichu and venusaur faced each other across the field for a moment then sprang at each other . instinct taking over commands rang out ,  razor leaf !  newline thunderbolt newline raichu squeals in pain as it is lacerated by a flurry of leafy shurikens and in retaliation fires a blue bolt of electricity that knocks venusaur flying . steaming slightly venusaur is immediately back in the game , the lighting looking impressive but doing relatively little to stop its advances .  use solar beam !  the man cries out and venusaurs flower begins to take in light , charging its attack newline use thunder comes the grim reapers command . raichu arcs its back and its tail glows for a moment as a savage bolt from above lances down inches from venusaur . newline bugger , never could trust it in a pinch ... double team ! raichu flickers for a moment and then a second appears at its side . venusaurs solar beam meanwhile has charged . it plants its feet and roars as a yellow pillar of fire erupts skywards and cannons down on raichu . it cries out in pain as venusaurs attack sears it and then lies still , passed out with fur smouldering . death retrieves his beaten pokmon and throws out his second choice , rapidash . the fiery steed stamping its hooves and then whinnying as it rears , mane aflame . newline an impressive start . let us see how you handle this next challenge newline newline  i ve fought enough pokmon battles in my time , do nt you worry  newline newline i sha nt . bounce newline the blazing unicorn prances then leaps skyward .  bullet seed ! shoot it down venusaur . venusaur let s fly with a barrage of small hard seeds from its flower , its hits do no more than graze however as rapidash crashes down , driving venusaur hard into the ground , knocking it out cold . livid bruises showing instantly on his body . wincing in sympathy the challenger withdraws venusaur , sending out the hulking armoured behemoth , blastoise instead . newline deaths command slams out again , newline bounce and rapidash springs upwards once more .  blastoise , water gun !  the great turtle rocks back and its cannons fire a jet of water skywards . it s a direct hit and rapidash is knocked off course and thumps heavily down , clearly incensed . it canters angrily about then lowers its horn and charges . orders from its master unneeded newline newline  defence curl !  blastoise responds immediately and with some relief , tucking in its head and limbs as rapidash careens into its shell at full force . there is a sickening crunch and a squeal of pain from both parties as the horn punches into blastoises side to the base . rapidash pulls free and dances madly around , its horn crimson and eyes crazy , obviously concussed as its begins to wobble from foot to foot . blastoise does not seem to be faring much better . it reemerges from its shell with murder in its eyes and a rill of blood running down it s body . with a roar of anger it fires both cannons at rapidash , knocking the dazed horse to the floor and extinguishing its flames . that done it slumps . both combatants withdrawing their pokmon and throwing their last ball . charizard , a proud draconid form , fire at its tail tip snorts fire as it faces a brooding humanoid . malice emanating like a bad smell . newline now , the pointy end . this is not a fight you can win . yield . there is no shame newline newline  not a chance ! charizard and me have eaten mewtwo for breakfast before , we wo nt be beaten this time  charizard looks around at his trainer . one who raised him from a tiny charmander and flexes , there is something final in the air and he can smell . he grunts in greeting and stokes the fire in his throat , preparing to meet his foe . no commands issue forth from either death or the challenger as the two combatants fly into action . charizards wings open and he soars up as a purple ball of energy blasts the ground he stood on . more follow as he streaks forwards , twisting and dodging as he unloads his own payload of roaring flames on his foe , the strike nothing but empty space as mewtwo flashes to the side , a snap of ozone signalling the teleportation . he strikes as charizard banks , moving close to deliver a brutal strike that flings the fire pokmon to the ground . charizard rolls to dodge the following blow , coming up with tail whipping , the blazing end sending embers flying as it thuds into mewtwos midriff . winded , the two circle , trading bolts of energy and jets of flame as their commanders will their champions on . bruised and burned the two spring at each other once more . primal rage meeting cold calculated malice as they bite and kick . as they twist they rise into the air , buoyed by mewtwo s telekinesis until he swings and casts charizard earthwards with a brutal force . the impact shakes the ground and the crack and roar of pain from charizard signal at least one broken bone . as the dust settles mewtwo descends , coming to claim his victory . the challenger breaks and sprints yelling for charizard to rise until he alone stands between the two , staring into purple eyes with not a shred of mercy in them , a lazy flick of the wrist flings the challenger into the dust but even as the breath leaves his lungs a furious roar sounds and propelled by torn wings charizard rakes its claws across mewtwos face , blood flying from the gashes in a fine mist as the two wounded creatures come together again , neither willing to give in to exhaustion and pain . newline newline in the dust , the challenger sat up , coughing , the sound of the two pokmon scrapping fading out as death stood by him , blue twinkling eyes bright in their empty sockets newline newline yield . you can not win this fight , he will fight to the end for you and it will probably mean your victory , but what is the triumph in that ? what else would you sacrifice for a small victory over me ? your health ? your mind ? you have already battled me with those to a standstill , the flower of your youth and the river of your mind threw themselves against me and were worn down , worthy opponents though they were . do not lose the fire of your soul too , your time here is past and now you must follow me . newline newline  but what other option do i have ? to give up , to die ? i ca nt go yet , i m only 56 , i still need to see my children married , my grandchildren ? newline newline that is the nature of the world and there is nothing i can do to change it . there is only so much sand in a lifetimer , once it has run out there is nothing i can do but my duty . newline newline  but i ca nt ...  the old man sobbed  i m not ready  newline newline few ever are and yet , you held me off for long enough . long enough for you to say goodbye i think . do not despair . so long as one leaves the world a better place , that is the most one can hope for , and you leave a legacy of kindness with your children that will not go unrecognised . newline newline death snapped his bony fingers and his slashed and bloody mewtwo vanished . seeing this , the old man walked over to where his charizard lay , panting and bleeding in the ground and lay the creatures head in his lap stroking its warm orange scales gently as he soothed his exhausted champion . he looked up at the black robed figure again as words slammed into existence in his head without seeming to trouble his ears . newline newline time enough to say goodbye , i can give you that much . newline newline  what ? what do you ...  newline but the world was already changing . the beast in his lap vanishing , the air twisting until it resolved its self into a hospital room . the challenger in its sole bed and on either side , a young adult . a son and daughter there for their father . death watched from the corner as the old man s eyes opened and the two siblings started , not expecting to see them lucid again . as the aged fellow made his peace with his loved ones , death examined the small brick like object on the bedside table . the front read  gameboy color  and the cartridge in the back ,  pokmon : red edition  humans . whatever will they think of next ? death knew he should nt take an interest but he had rather enjoyed the experience . behind him he sensed the last few moments of life slipping away and reached for his scythe , stopped , and drew his sword instead . the sword was really just for kings but he felt the old man had earned the honour . the timer emptied . the blade swung . newline newline ah hello again . now you must walk with me . for you have far to go . but first death handed the shade of the old man the gameboy newline i believe i would like a rematchat 5am the traffic started up again and the noise bled into my office and drowned out the noise of snoring from my damn parrot , geordie . i fucking hated that bird  more when he was awake , but a whole hell of a lot when he was asleep too . newline newline my desk was full , photos and receipts jostling with bottles and dirty coffee cups for space and both of them losing to the large , overflowing ashtray , which i pulled towards me to stub out another butt  it did nt matter any more if there was ash everywhere . it had been a long time since i d slept and felt like weeks since i d emptied the ashtray  i was no longer sure which was a metaphor for the other . newline newline the facts did nt lie . i d been a cop once , not a very good one , but good enough to remember that if you followed the evidence back to the beginning , then you found the truth . problems often started when you did nt want to believe the truth . now i was a dick , both in job and nature and a pretty mediocre one at that . i worked the cases that the better pi agencies gave up , the ones that were nt worth the time or money , but it was my life and while it was kind of pathetic , i settled into a nice rut and had been hoping to ride it through until cancer or a cheating husband got me . newline newline geordie stirred , woken by a heavy truck that thundered past outside and shook the building . he cocked his head to the side and looked at me with his judgemental stare .  morning fucker !  he chirruped . i hated that bird . newline newline i checked my watch again . 5:15am , i had nearly two hours until i wanted to be home , to catch her as she left for the day . my wife , the teacher , perfect in every regard , except this one . she d recovered so quickly after emily s death , while i d gone to bits  she d been my rock and had given me all the support a husband could want . just three days ago i d have ripped anyone who doubted her to shreds . three days can change a lot . newline newline i ve always kept an office far from home , when you re a pi , you get the occasional unhappy visitor and you do nt want them knowing where you live  it s better to have a nice drive home , so you can spot a tail . when my wife and emily had bought me geordie it was because they thought i needed company , if it was nt for emily i would have strangled and eaten him , but she loved him , loved visiting him , so i put up with him . newline newline the little green bastard hopped around his cage excitedly and with a sigh i heaved myself off my seat to fill his seed bowl . a slew of pictures fell as i stood and splashed across the floor . emily , naked , dead , cut into pieces , the red almost filling the frame on every picture . newline newline three days ago the package had arrived and inside were the details of the hitman my wife had hired , photos of them meeting , receipts , evidence , everything that would be needed to convict him and the bitch , enough to put them away for life . i had no idea why she d done it , or who had sent me the pack , but i did nt care . it took me less than a day to confirm it all . my wife had paid for our daughter to die . newline newline he d died less than twelve hours ago , easily found in a sleazy motel  i d kicked in the door and done it with my hands . it had felt good to feel the life slip from him as i pressed down on his neck , his hands scrabbling at my back , until his eyes went dim . i did nt trust myself to do that with my wife , my betrayer . i did nt want to give her the chance to somehow try to talk her way out of it . the gun in my pocket was new and registered to me , i wanted this to be easy to figure out for the poor cop who got my case . newline newline outside the morning air bit into me , i lit a cigarette and then reached into my coat and

poor harry ... . now ai nt that a kick in the head ?  newline newline newline the king of cool was born .the sun was high above the park , illuminating the gorgeous greens of spring trees and blues of freshly bloomed flowers , whose aromas drifted along the twisted , rocky path . they tantalized a man , whose body was old , yet obviously strong . he wore a threadbare shirt , and well used jeans . all that gave away his ancient age were the wrinkles on his face and hands , the thin white hair that hung off his head like strings from a sweater , and his eyes . newline newline these were the eyes of one who had seen so much that every book ever written , every story ever told was a mere fraction of his knowledge . eyes that had witnessed the rise and fall of cities , civilizations , even entire species . but in this moment , only the warmth and smells mattered . for that moment , he was just a man who had lived far past his time , enjoying the fauna . slowly , a rare slight smile , spread across his face . newline newline his respite was not long lived . from the near skyrise where black clouds of the coming storm had gathered , a low , deep growl of thunder rolled across the peaceful oasis of green , reminding the whitehaired man of the importance of his afternoon stroll . his pace quickened as his smile was immediately replaced by the stern frown that had etched those wrinkles into him all those eons ago . newline newline he approached the designated place . it was in a small culvert of the park , along a path rarely walked . sitting there was an ancient wooden bench stained by the elements and time , supported by cracked granite and sitting underneath a freshly bloomed cherry blossom . on the right side of this bench stood an unsettling looking gentleman . his body was tall and thin , highlighted by a new black suit that had far too much slack . his fingers were long , bony extremities that resembled talons . his face was what made him a disturbing sight . the skin was stretched to tight across the skeletal structure of his jaw , his eyes slightly shrunken into his head , but still the gaze was as sharp and deadly as daggers . hair flowed down his shoulders that had been pitch black for so many millennium , but was now fading to grey on the tips . newline newline the opponents stared at each other , recognizing the significance of not only what they were about to do , but also that they were the last , the only ones left to decide . after a moment , they sat on opposite sides , and prepared . out came the board , a gift from ruler long forgotten . its border made of rich mahogany , and inside , sixty four perfect squares . thirty two were pure white , made of pearls , while the others were of deep black onyx . on this checkered battlefield , the armies were assembled . sixteen footmen stared across the field at each other , knowing their probable fate . as the queens directed the other twelve veterans into position , the kings stood their places , staring across the front lines , into the soul of the enemy . newline newline as troop movements ended , there was a long silence , the calm before the deadly storm . then , the first white soldier stepped forwards , beginning the conflict to end all conflicts . over the next few hours , these old men strategized and manipulated , using tactics never seen or imagined , yet never a word was said . between them sat their joint history , so much death , so much loss . every piece merely trying to make a difference before being taken . newline newline voices could be heard down the path , and both men paused the game to turn and see a young couple stroll into the isolated area . they did not notice the old men , their attentions turned fully to the conversation at hand , as they sat on the bench opposite . newline newline the white haired man turned back to the game , lazily restarting the endless battle .  samantha and christopher ,  the first words stated by the white haired man in years . his voice still as strong as a gale wind .  they are to be married soon .  newline newline the man in black offered a slight chuckle , whose presence made the air tangibly colder .  they call themselves sam and chris , apparently real names are too long for their limited intelligence .  newline newline  they do seem so in love .  newline newline the black man barely tilted his head in their direction .  it is of no consequence .  newline newline the man in white paused his soldiers middefensive maneuver .  do you not see the greatness of what has been created here ? what they have turned into ?  newline newline the man in black considered the board , seeing the impending counter attack . he then turned towards the pair .  chris  father , an abusive drunk who killed the whore mother , and sam ran away from a psychotic grandmother , their greatness is truly lost on me .  newline newline the battlefield remained stagnant , the soldiers frozen as though insects caught in tree sap .  yet they found each other , beyond all the odds and all the evil acts .  newline newline after a pause , the battle resumes . both men lost in thought , though no longer about wars and consequences .  and even with all that love , he is still seeing another woman . even now , he is thinking about her . they are selfish species . so much time they have been given , so many chances to fix their mistakes . and yet all they have mastered is how to kill one another , how to destroy all the gifts they have been given . they do not deserve our love , nor our mercy . they need a fresh start to learn from the mistakes of the past .  newline newline the conversation is interrupted by a high pitch screech followed by a series of giggles and a hearty laugh echoed between the trees , originating from the opposite bench . the men turn , staring at the entwined lovers , at the wonder encompassed in that small moment . newline  see how they look at each other ? do you hear what is between them ? no where else in all of creation can you find such passion . with all the mistakes they have made , it is their beauty and intensity that has truly been mastered . even now they strive to prefect everything they find , beyond any plans we made or could have made . it is not our right to strip them of the chance to right themselves .  newline newline the man in black turned , staring into the ageold eyes of his brother .  even with all we have seen , with all they have done and could do ?  newline newline the man in white continued staring at the other bench .  if anyone deserves a second chance ,  he nods at the couple ,  they do .  newline newline a soldier is absentmindedly moved forwards . the clunk of his final step on the long , bloody journey complete . while neither man had thought about the consequences , they subconsciously perceived the event that had just occurred . newline newline they both looked down , and saw it , the final checkmate . newline newline the white king bowed his head for the final time , before falling to the onyx floor . the following silence was the twin to the sound just before the beginning of life , where they all sat staring at the lump of celestial components that would be come life in the universe . the omega to that ancient and forgotten alpha . newline newline the man in black was the first to stand . there was no gloating in his eyes , no satisfaction , only duty . he glanced at sam and chris , still cuddled in an embrace , as if it would protect them from what was to come . the look lasted only a moment , before he spun quickly , throwing his dark trench coat over his shoulders to protect his thin stature from the rapidly rising winds . he walked out of the small culvert , down the untrodden path and disappeared into the growing shadows of the trees . newline newline still the man in white sat there , staring at the treasured board , shivering in the cold breeze . his joints creaked as he slowly stood , and turned one last time towards sam and chris . their smiles were so radiant , so full of life , so full of ignorance for what had been decided . they were smiles that would haunt him forever . as the man in white turned towards the lonely path , the first drop came from above . it landed on the stonyfaced white king , slowly sliding down his cheek like a tear

through the halls of her castle , seemingly more quiet than it was just a few years before . her head bowed in shame , she makes her way to a particular set of quarters . drawing in a breath , she gently raps on the door . newline newline  who is it ?  comes a question , the voice one of pain and resignation . newline newline  it s me dieter .  malvina says .  may i come in ?  she pauses , afraid of the answer . newline newline the voice from behind the door drips with sarcasm and scorn .  i do not see why you bother asking , considering you do not take into account others  feelings about matters . you are sovereign over this entire island . you can take what you want or force someone to do something and they can not say boo . i can personally attest to the fact . but yes , i can theoretically let you in . after all , any and all of my socalled freedoms are completely theoretically . but if we re pretending i have any rights , yes come in .  newline newline malvina turns the door knob and steps inside the room . it s a sizable space , meant for visiting dignitaries and fellow royalty . crown molding trims where wall meets ceiling . a fresco depicting her kingdom s naval victories graces the ceiling , showing triumphant galleasses and carracks against enemy corsairs . in the center of the room is a four poster bed . emerald green silk sheets cover it , with velvet curtains pulled back from the sides . he is sitting on it , staring down at his hands as he does knot work . newline newline  what do you want ?  his words are harsh and unkind , worlds apart from the tenderness and affection he d displayed just a few days before . he does nt look up at her , intent he is on his work . newline newline  i , i wish to apologize for what i did to you . it was wrong of me and i m sorry .  her voice wavers slightly as she speaks . newline newline dieter pulls on the rope with a grunt , pausing to admire his work .  too little , too late for apologies malvina it would seem ?  he sets his work down , and wills himself calm . he looks up at her , eyes damp from tears .  why did nt you ask me ?  newline newline queen malvina wills herself to meet his gaze .  because i knew you d say no .  she says softly . newline newline dieter nods his head , wiping away an errant tear .  damn right i would have . but no , you came for me in my sleep , so i could nt say no . but somehow i do nt think any amount of pleading or begging of mine would have made a difference . no , you had your heart set on doing what you did , regardless of my feelings for the situation . was nt it enough that you imprisoned me here forever ? i d accepted that fate . i was prepared to live fifty , sixty years here and then die of old age or sickness . i would have enjoyed my time here , as best as i could .  his eyes focus on hers . his gray eyes like cold steel .  but what you did , you took even that from me . you stole my mortality .  he reaches over and tosses her the rope work . she catches it reflexively . her eyes widen in surprise , it is a hangman s rope . newline newline malvina winces , biting her lip as she thinks .  i am not sorry for making you immortal like me . i am only sorry that i have hurt you . it was selfish of me , i know that . aside from your mortality , and your freedom , is there anything i can do for you ?  she shuts her eyes for a moment , to prevent herself from crying . newline newline her friend says nothing , instead laying himself out on the bed to stare up at the fresco . a few minutes later , he speaks .  do you love me ?  newline newline malvina s face becomes one of surprise . afraid her hearing is failing , she replies .  what ?  newline newline dieter rolls to face her , his eyes full of melancholy and ruefulness .  do you love me malvina ?  newline newline she rushes to his side and clutches his hand in her own . placing against her cheek , she chokes back tears .  of course i do dieter ! it s why i ve done everything i ve done . imprisoning you here , making you immortal , it was so i d never lose you .  newline newline he strokes her cheek , chuckling softly as he smiles .  malvina ... i have almost nothing . my home is gone forever . even if i wished to return , i could not go back . the only person who cared about me there is dead . i have no gold , no wealth . nothing to start up a new life . i do not have my liberty , forced to remain here instead . though i would have nowhere to go if you ever gave it to me . i have no coin , and no contacts . i do not even have my life , the right to end it taken from me . i have only one thing left in this world .  newline newline malvina leans closer , intrigue clear on her face .  what is that ?  newline newline dieter props himself up , smiling . he moves closer to her , the scent of rosewater and thyme in her hair . softly , he says .  you .  newline newline he presses his lips to hers , snaking his fingers through her raven hair . she reciprocates , tasting the hint of brandy on his lips . her hands clutch at him , as if afraid he ll vanish into aether . they break , gasping for air , before they kiss yet again , desperate for the other . he breaks off , looking into her viridian eyes with affection . newline newline  i would never leave you malvina . i love you .  newline newline he kisses her again , dancing light pecks across her shoulder and up her neck , teasing his way across her jaw before finding her lips once more . gasping in delight , she nibbles on his ear , enjoying his shuddering . they press on . newline newline the sounds of pleasure and joy readily evident , the castle staff smile as they tiptoe down the hall during their duties . it has been far too long since their ruler has been happy . the past two

beautiful . newline newline newlinemy brother . if you could ever know of the darkness . if you knew of the black saplings feeding from my gut . their metal roots cling to the flesh of my goodness ,

come on sometimes you actually need to lie goddamnit sometimes it actually does some real good but it literally scars you for life ... newline newline i have my fair number of scars , mostly very light ones , i can take my shirt off when i go to the beach without most of them showing , heck i can have sex with a girl and they wo nt notice most , the more necessary you felt that the lie was the better hidden the scar is , so most of mine are in addition to very light on ... convenient spots . i have scars on the back of my thighs , i have two behind my ears , i have some on my armpits . i once heard of a guy who had one on his penis , it turns out how you feel about the lie makes a huge difference in what scar it will leave you and where , just imagine that guy getting undressed in front of a woman , or man whatever he is into anyway . well at least some girls say scars are sexy , or so i  ve heard . newline newline you do get used to it but still ... i once had a pretty long conversation with a war veteran about scars , now that was scarring . he took he shirt off to show me his body he was full . i first noticed two bullets scars , did nt think i could recognize them but damn do they look different . the bullet scars though , they were nice compared to the rest , they were in battle defending his country but the rest of his body was more scar tissue than actual skin , there were spots where i could nt even make out how many scars he had . they formed one big pile of butchered up skin . during our conversation i found out that he actually got all the visible scars he had on his upper body in a single week , he was taken as a prisoner of war and trust me , the only countries that actually give even a single flying fuck about the geneva convention are the ones that have already won the war . long story short , pretty much all the scars were from the lies he told trying to lead the enemies away while they were torturing him instead of giving them real information , it s mad how they can torture you into treachery without leaving a scar on your body . it is true though , everyone breaks given enough time . newline newline the war veteran story is my goto example on why we should nt judge people by their scars . there is a whole other story that i just ca nt get myself to tell . too goddamn sad , well probably not so when you just hear it as a story but you were not there talking with him you did not see the sorrow and the chaos on his face . newline newline his name was george . in my country he have to serve in the military , mandatory service . the military of course is purely defensive and the service is easier than professional militaries naturally . george was pretty much the nicest guy we all knew , he would never even lie . there had been a few occasions where others were mad at him because he would tell our officers about anything they asked and being the military there were consequences , he really , actually never lied . we also noticed after a couple of months that even though most would get out of bath completely naked since we were only men , he would get in and out always wearing a tshirt , and whenever he had to change his tshirt without taking a bath he hid , went to the bathroom or was alone someway . we all wondered but we thought that he just lied without us noticing and wanted to hide his scars , all the others still believe that but i know . newline newline george and i became friends over time . we would go out for a drink , we would even go to the gym or for a run together sometimes . the park where we run was closer to his home so one day when it started raining he told me to come take a shower at his place , he d lend me some clothes and drive me home . he let me get in to take a shower first . i got in finished my shower and got out , he went in right after me . seconds after he got in i realized a left my shoes in the bathroom and i sweat a lot so my shoes get smelly so i wanted to get them to the balcony . being used to it from my service , who we had both finished some months prior to that day , where we did nt really care if someone saw us naked i just opened the door and went in without knocking . god i wish i had nt . newline newline i saw george s back as he was getting in the shower , he just froze as he saw the awe in my face when i stared at his single scar , one single scar in the entirety of his body , it was a huge scar spanning diagonally on his whole back , it was so large it reminded me of video game characters , and so deep i thought it was seethrough where the skin met the spine . i just looked at him and he knew , he got a look that was stuck in his face for the rest of the week and just said  let me finish my shower and i ll explain  . newline newline and so he finished , and so he explained , and so i was moved , then i processed what he said and i was devastated , and then i thought about it once more and i started to cry , then he let go and started to cry even more than i did . newline newline it was one of the saddest stories i had ever heard . until you are 1316 depending on the person you get no scars from lying , i mean come on who doesn  t lie as a kid . one day you wake up with an already fainted scar across your whole face which goes away in a day or two and that is how you know you now get scars from lying . so george was relatively lucky as he got his initiation scar a couple of weeks after he became sixteen . newline newline when george was 14 his mother got cancer . his 3 years younger sister got cancer too a year later , while his father had died in an accident when george was 9 . his mother was given a 60  chance of getting rid of the cancer for good at the beginning with chemotherapy . she didn  t . a month after she learned that her cancer got too spread to be completely stopped , her daughter got cancer too . george said the doctor believed that his mother must have been exposed to radiation when pregnant with his sister else it was just a very tragic coincidence that they both got cancer in such a small time interval with his sister at such a young age . newline newline george  s mother stopped chemotherapy just before he became 15 since the doctor said it wouldn  t help anymore . his sister was never given much chance , a mere 10  that chemotherapy would even do anything . newline newline his mother couldn  t get out of bed just before george turned 16 . at the same time the doctor told his sister that chemotherapy couldn  t do anything anymore and that she was giving her about another year and 6 to 8 months in a  good enough  health . newline newline naturally george and his sister wanted their mother to die knowing her daughter at least would survive . so they thought they  d lie to her , tell her that her daughter was getting better . george learned how to do makeup and helped his sister so she would seem in good health no matter what happened . they told their mum that even though she had gotten past cancer she started paying attention to the details of life and that she wanted to start putting on make up to look better and her being 13 at the time her mother believed her . newline newline and so george kept lying , with a lie that started a few weeks after he got his first scar , he kept saying the same lie to his mother everyday . his mother got worse and so did his sister . his mother died 6 months after george got 16 years old , his sister one month after that , the doctor predicted wrong . the last two months that their mother was alive his sister couldn  t get out of bed and so every day he lied to his mother that his sister had to study , or that she didn  t get a very good grade on a test and didn  t want to disappoint her , or that she went out with friends whenever his mother asked why his sister did nt visit much . on the days his sister was feeling better she put on makeup , gathered all her strength and walked enough to go sit beside her mother  s bed . and so george kept lying so that his mother would die happy , every day for hours each day he lied to his dying mother that his dying sister was well , a few weeks before the end he told her that his sister had gotten fully rid of her tumor while his sister would faint trying to get up and see her mother . and george kept lying even the last few days when his mother could hardly see or talk and asked to see her daughter , so george said that she went abroad in a school program for students good in literature related subjects and she called him to relay her love for her mother to her , while she was in the hospital 20 meters away on the same floor , hanging on to life by a thread . then his mother died and he couldn  t lie anymore , his sister died and he could hardly feel like he could live anymore . newline newline all that left him with one big scar , the same lie being told over and over and over again devastating him even more each time , killing him inside and out a bit more each time creating a scar that would never heal . creating a scar that was bigger than anyone i and maybe anyone else living on this godforsaken planet has ever seen . creating a scar that made every other evil , obstacle or problem seem redundant , turning george into the best person i had ever known , into the best person anyone that met him had ever known . newline newline it  s a mad world , and it  s mad to judge people by their scars , some carry them with sorrow , some with pride , some with regret some with happiness , some only need one , some have none , some can  t seem to get enough . newline . newline newline newline newline newline this is my first ever prompt , pretty much the first story i ve ever written to be honest  outside of school of course  . feedback is appreciated newline also sorry if it got too sad too fast in the end i was listening to tears in heaven by eric clapton when i started writing , a very sad song who i only found out about yesterday , worth a listen . newline newline edit : so i m done with changes to the story , may edit in the future if i find any spelling or grammar mistakes woody , woody ! come here ! i think i found our brothers !   woody comes over and looks into the nightstand , as he looks at buzz he has a look of horror on his face .  buzz we do nt even look anything like those things . i am white , you are white , those things are black .  buzz looks at woody and says  how do you know what these are for ?  woody replies  i snuck into andy s mom s room late at night and saw her stick these things up her , you know thing .   buzz quickly understands and is forever scarred by what he saw . as buzz goes to close the drawer woody shouts at buzz  quick ! andy s mom is coming !  they both drop as they are unable to hide . andy s mom enters the room and she see s her toy drawer open along with buzz and woody next to it . she thinks  oh my , new toys ? time to get kinky .  as she picks up woody , woody looks at buzz and smiles while giving him the thumbs up . buzz watches in horror as woody disappears into a dark , wet hole .i m losing my eyes tomorrow . i ve made my peace with it , mostly , but there s one thing that scares me . newline newline my friends are all assholes . newline newline they re the worst , and they ve never gotten me to watch 2 girls 1 cup , and now they ve got less than 24 hours left to make me . newline newline i am terrified . newline newline so far they ve hijacked my tv , my cell phone , and i do nt know how , but they found a way to air it on the jumboton during a ball game . dan is going to jail for that one , and i m getting better at jumping out windows than i ever imagined . newline newline i m having dinner with my family tonight , i ve already asked my brother to watch the parking lot for them . i m pretty sure i saw one of them buying a giant tv , a wagon , and a ton of extension chords earlier . newline newline the hospital has been informed , and will be checking id s of everyone entering my room . impersonating a doctor is nothing to these guys . newline newline 19 hours to go , people . wish me luck .like everyone else , samantha had always seen it as a vague , grey figure on the horizon . newline newline sometimes you could even convince yourself it was a trick of the eye . but she knew , one day , she would see the face of the reaper . her reaper . newline newline when hers disappeared , she thought it was simply her imagination , at first . but as the days trickled past , no grey figure reappeared . there was nothing nagging at her peripheral vision , no cold fear as she glimpsed him on the horizon . newline newline unlike her friends , she had never been able to shake the feeling of being watched , of being followed . they accepted the reapers as a natural part of life , and went on living . but she could nt . until he disappeared . newline newline for the first time in her life , her anxiety lifted , and she could look on the world freely . she could live . newline newline        newline newline the reaper drifted away from his assigned human , to watch samantha again . his human s neighbor . so lovely , she was , and so free , now . newline newline he was watching her when he felt the cold draft of his presence , before he heard the voice . newline newline  you should nt have done this ,  death said , as he came to stand beside the reaper . one of billions , but this one had done something ... unusual . unforgivable . newline newline  i just wanted ...  the reaper began to defend himself , but death spoke over him . newline newline  no matter your motived , the murder of your brother is unacceptable . even for a young reaper , you should know better . what did you think would happen ? that she would live forever ? that you could watch her life , forever ?  death whispered . his eyes burned black as they settled on the reaper . newline newline the reaper looked away from the depths of death s gaze , watching samantha instead . laughing , shockingly carefree , at some joke someone was telling her . newline newline  i just wanted him to leave her alone . he did nt ... he did nt even care for her ,  the reaper said miserably . there was really no defense , none at all . he had always been a poor reaper , and his relative youth was no excuse . he was simply still too affected by humans . newline newline  maybe you should just get rid of me ,  the reaper suggested , feeling almost hopeful . he d never been overly fond of his duties . truth be told , he d rather just have died than become one . newline newline death grinned .  i m afraid not . once i turn a deceased human into a reaper , that s that . no going back . i never go back on my actions . but i ll have to teach you how to do your job , somehow .  newline newline he cocked his head and seemed to think . newline newline  well , tell you what . i ll make sure nobody else bothers her . nobody but you ,  death whispered , and placed an emaciated hand on the reaper s shoulder , filling him with purpose . he would have to follow samantha now , and another would be assigned to his old human . he would have to get closer to samantha every day . newline newline  look on the bright side ,  death said lightly , as the reaper looked stricken .  you ll get the chance to meet her now . in about fifty years , if i m not mistaken .  newline newline      newline newline hope you enjoyed my story ! you can find more of my work on rinkfinger .the winds howled , we struggled through the snowstorm , one mile to go until we hit what should be the south pole , but no one knew we were here . no one from nasa , no one from the nsa . we killed frank three miles back when phil found out he was an illuminati spy . no one was tracking us now . newline newline we reached ... it . what should have been the south pole , the snow cascaded down , floating down a steep ledge . phil peered over the edge . newline newline  give me a rope , and the camera . i need to photograph this ,  he shouted . newline newline within a few minutes we had him properly anchored and dangling over the edge . we gave him twenty meters of rope . we saw flashes from his camera , then nothing . newline newline we waited another minute then pulled him up . he was nt breathing . sam tried to get him breathing again while i looked through the camera . newline newline  sam ! you wo nt believe this !  i said . newline newline phil gasped and sat up ,  there s no air down there ,  he breathed hard , his freezing breath clouding the air . newline newline i held up the camera s screen . the earth was sat upon the back of four elephants , enormous , larger than a continent . underneath those elephants , a turtle . under the turtle , another turtle , and another . newline newline sam rushed over , snatched the camera from me and looked through the photos .  it s turtles all the way down ,  he said .i don  t think you know how loved you are . newline newline when you came home with us i sat with you in the back seat , hugging your crate in an attempt to make you feel better . for the most part you were quiet , but occasionally you gave whisper of a cry in there and it broke my heart because i wanted you to know you were safe . but you  d only just met me and the woman you did know , your lovely foster mother , was now somewhere far , far away . i couldn  t blame you for being scared . newline newline my boyfriend and i had only just moved into our apartment , so there wasn  t much for you there yet , but you didn  t seem to care . you weren  t in the mood for exploring . you found safety behind the washing machine and you hid there for three days . it broke my heart each night when i laid down in bed and realized this was another full day i didn  t get to see you , hug you , and tell you i love you . and i loved you so much but you didn  t let me show you . in the meantime i sat on the bathroom floor , just talking to you , wondering if you were listening or if you asleep back there . i made sure to speak quietly and use your name often , and your foster mom told me that you grew up with npr playing in the background , so when i wasn  t there to talk to you i left my phone on the sink so you could listen to what i always thought stood for nerd public radio . i left a little pile of food in front of the washing machine and i made sure your water bowl was there so you didn  t have to go far . you weren  t born yesterday , you weren  t a kittenyou needed your time and space , and as much as it killed me , i made sure to give it to you . newline newline then the fourth day came , and while i was sitting on the couch enjoying the last weekend before my new job started , you came out of the hallway , jumped onto the couch , and laid yourself across my belly like a blanket . i hugged you and cried , and you just stretched as far as you could and settled on your side . you let me pet the cloud that is your tummy and your heavy purrs vibrated through me like a gentle wave . this was my first experience of true love , attachment , and euphoria . i thought you , my first ever pet , would never come to love me . but there you were , enjoying the utter bliss of the love i  d bottled up for you for three long days . newline newline newline we  ve been inseparable ever since . you  re always there waiting for me at the door when i come home from work , and you meow your complaints about where i  ve been but the stress only lasts a few seconds . because right after i take off my shoes and coat , and you and i lay on the couch together while i hold you close against me like i did my first stuffed animal . and while you purr , i stroke your head as we watch those dumb cooking shows . we have a ritual , you and i , and i can  t tell which of the two of us loves it more . personally i think i do , but i guess i  m a little biased . newline newline you  re larger than most cats , a whopping eighteen pound maine coon mix , but i think you forget that sometimes . you barely fit in the cat tree i bought you but you try your damnedest to squish in there anyway . and i have to hold your head and front paws up if you want to sit on my lap , because you just can  t get all of yourself on there , but it  s ok because you let me pet your jellybean toes every time you try . you  re ridiculously soft and so wondrously warm  i can  t imagine going to bed anymore with you there under my arm , pressed against my stomach . newline newline i cherish you and love you and look forward to the many years we have left together . sometimes i wish i  d met you while you were still a kitten , but i imagine you were probably the sweetheart of the litter . but instead of dwelling on what could have been , i  ll just pet you while you sit beside me on the couch , snoring and dreaming of i can  t even imagine what . i  ll keep smothering you with love , and the boyfriend will do the same after he comes home from a long day of being overworked and underpaid , and we  ll keep kissing you on the forehead before bed . newline newline we love you , and i really hope you know that . newlinefamily drive . 0200 hours newline newline you had to get up at two oclock in the morning . yes , two oclock . you , and your parents , and lucy , your twin sister . you had to get up at a ungodly hour of the morning , because your father , who may or may not be just a little crazy , said that this was the best way to travel . the night is the best time for travelers ,  he says . it is a time to think , a time to ponder , a time to wonder while you wander .  you wonder why you did nt fly , or at least take a train . newline newline dad is going through a checklist to make sure you have everything you need for the trip . jackets , check . hats , check . sunscreen , check . money  not enough , more likely than not , but check . a backup of the checklist ? check . newline newline you all get into the car . the trusty subaru . four years old and sixtyfour thousand miles on it . dad is in front . mom is in the front passenger seat . that leaves you and lucy in the back . on a regular day , there is more than enough room for you both . but tonight ... today ... for this trip , with four duffel bags and four backpacks and a large cooler with food , not to mention all sorts of things mom insisted you bring , the fit is tight . it s made worse when lucy spreads her legs and takes up the middle seat , pinning you even more . when you glare at her , she sticks her tongue out at you . newline newline dad starts the car and pulls out of the driveway , stopping only to say goodbye to the mailbox . mom puts the radio on  to the classical music station that literally only she likes . dad does nt seem to notice . the drive begins . newline newline family drive 0300 newline newline the classical music was good for one thing . it made you nod off , for an hour . the nap is somewhat refreshing , but you slowly begin to realize that you are not in the best position . lucy has two seats all to herself , she s able to stretch her legs out comfortably . but you , you re stuck in just one seat , and dad s tall so his chair is moved back further , so your legs are stuck . and because your legs are stuck , you ca nt move your upper body as much either , and now you ve got a crick in your neck . newline newline the car is on the highway now . you can tell by the way there are no streetlights or buildings . and there are no cars . no cars at all . maybe dad had a point about how the early , early hours of the day are the best for traveling . there does nt seem to be another living soul anywhere but in the car . newline newline it s still dark though . very dark . but you ve fallen asleep and woken up twice in the last six hours , so you do nt think it s going to be easy to fall back asleep again . lucy , of course , is sleeping like a little baby . she kicks you in her sleep , completely oblivious . her sneaker connects with your leg and you grunt in pain . it hurts , but it hurts worse when you bump your head on that little hand grip thing on the side of your car door . you want to say a bad word , but you re not sure if mom and dad wo nt hear and you do nt want to get in trouble . newline newline so you sit and you look out the window at the dark sky and then lucy kicks you again . thoughts of getting even pass through your mind , but you re pretty sure hogtying your twin sister to the roof of the car is illegal . newline newline family road trip 0630 newline newline your legs fell asleep hours ago , and the numbness has moved up to your chest . lucy has kicked you no fewer than six times . and you

abuse , i d finally broken myself of the dark passivity i had once wielded like a club , to beat over the head of any remotely interesting person . i tapped into the magebond , thrall to master , that resided in my mind channels . this was the final step in my ascension to panarch status  the necessary sacrifice was this broken soul that i had bonded to me . newline newline i am one of the ascended , the master race hidden behind the depths of humanity . the pitiful fleshbags , rotting with their filth and their shows . the intricate designs of the circle drawn painstakingly in my own blood blended vedic , celtic and slavic patterns to form the channels through which the power will run once the ritual is complete . newline newline i gently held his head back , and it yielded like the sad ending of a boxing match . the kiss was metallic , tangy and filled with life . he nodded , the last vestiges of his will given to me utterly . newline newline i let go of his head , and pulled my

final orb of power capable of summoning the beast beyond this world . that was more than enough time to learn how to seal the beast , command the beast , and understand the rules of the beast s power . all that remained was a simple ritual and i could have what was rightfully mine . i had sold my birthright for the pittance of a single night of passion as a foolish youth , but now i would reclaim what the heavens themselves owed me and exact my vengeance . newline newline  speak your wish , mortal , that i may be unsealed and judge your greed .  newline newline  erase my debt .  newline newline the beast stared through me with an icy gaze as if to chill my very soul . i stood firm , refusing to compromise my demand . no threat of punishment for my greed would stand in my way . not now , not when i was this close . newline newline  even if it is only to satisfy others , you would wish for wealth knowing the result ?  newline newline  i do not owe a single coin to any man dead or alive . i will say it again . erase my debt .  newline newline the beast s stare shifted from judgment to piercing inquisition . the air of oppression weighing upon my chamber faltered for a moment in a betrayal of otherworldly resolution . i had won the contest of wills . all that remained was to claim the spoils of victory . newline newline  erase this debt of a thousand years , foul demon . return my mortal lifespan to me and take this curse of blood away from me .  newline newline the beast nodded slowly and placed one craggy palm upon my head . a wave of sensations flooded my consciousness . a feeling of mortality , an unfulfilled hunger fading to nothingness , and a sense of incredible peace assured me that i could no longer be called a vampire . having claimed his price in sin , the beast silently retreated through a curtain of fire to the unholy realm . newline newline i drew a knife from my belt with a sigh . my debt had been erased in entirety . my thirst for vengeance had disappeared along with my thirst for blood . even as a mortal , i still had my youth . that would be enough time to find a new purpose .i recently wrote my first horror  slight comedy  novel after years of writing short stories occasionally . i would say what motivated me was reading stephen king , he is really good at being a motivational coach and writing with a judgemental tone that made me feel like a loser for not being a multimillionaire bestseller . reading king s on writing also made crafting a novel feel far less daunting than i always feared it would be . newline newline another motivation was reading a jonathan maberry book , realizing that this guy was an utter hack yet a bestseller and that my short stories were leagues ahead of his work . i figured that if he could get published , it could nt be too hard . newline newline i wrote my first novel and have decided to publish it free online in hopes of getting fans and support to turn it into a trilogy .

more .  you re kidding me ,  john said with a smirk .  all of the superpowers in the world , and you pick this one ?  newline newline  i told you , i wished for the power of flight , and the genie found a loophole , okay ? it s not like i wanted the power of ...  newline newline  hovering ,  john painfully said .  hovering six inches above the ground . and you ca nt even move around . it s just stationary hovering . you should really be more careful next time you find a genie .  newline newline i groaned .  john , i m pretty sure that genies are a once in a lifetime kind of thing .  newline newline john chuckled .  well , you never know . anyway , what was your second wish ?  newline newline i sighed .  i wished for three more wishes .  newline newline john facepalmed .  come on , man ! you know that never works !  newline newline  i was nt thinking straight ,  i said regretfully .  the genie just shot me down , and then he said that it counted as my second wish !  newline newline  so that leaves the third wish . i assume it has something to do with our current predicament ?  newline newline i grimaced .  um , yeah . i wished for our city to be hotter . it was negative three degrees and i was freezing .  newline newline  and so he conjured a volcano and sent lava streams into the city ,  john said . newline newline  yeah , pretty much . although it worked out pretty well . turns out the lava streams were exactly five inches high .  newline newline john squirmed in my arms . the lava ran below us , just barely missing my toes as i hovered over the red mass .  i guess that was lucky . it s a shame about all the dead people , though .  newline newline a charred skeleton floated underneath as he said this . i cringed at the thought of all the trouble this would cause . but soon we had more pressing problems . both of our stomachs rumbled at the same time . we looked at each other . john said ,  how long are we going to have to hover here ?  newline newline  about 2 days , give or take . the lava will take time to harden .  newline newline  oh , okay .  silence .  you got a granola bar ? i remember when i first met her . newline newline the box was large enough to be a coffin , and wrapped in this gaudy polar bear wrapping paper even though it was july . i could nt help but feel i had seen the paper somewhere before , but shook the feeling quickly . ever since the news surfaced people have been receiving strange packages from  themselves .  mother received a dead rat that morning . i guess it was just my turn . newline newline i tore through the wrapping paper to find , lo and behold , a coffin . a little bit dark but if it all went down hill i could always bury it in the garden in the back . lord knows it was already a pit of death the way i ve been treating it . before i could do anything , the coffin sprang open and out popped me . newline newline well , sort of . i was a 28 year old woman of medium build who makes a habit of wearing pastel colors and plaid everywhere and is nt ashamed of a little cat hair . the person who just jumped out of a coffin was a 28 year old woman of medium build who made a habit of wearing pastel colors and plaid everywhere , was nt ashamed of a little cat hair , and was wearing an eyepatch . newline newline wearing is nt the right word . i noticed pretty quickly that it was actually a piece of notebook paper that had been colored black with a sharpie and tapped over one eye . i wanted to ask about it but was immediately faced with a question of my own . newline newline  are you ready to lose your virginity ?  jovially chimed the other me . newline newline i stood there . this is nt an offer that comes up a lot for me . newline newline  come on , i know just how you like it . i ve been looking to get it on with someone myself and this seemed like the perfect opportunity .  newline newline  what happened to your eye ?  it was the only thing i could think to say . newline newline  i put an eyepatch over it , duh . why are we still wearing pants ?  newline newline  nice wrapping paper .  i was biding for time at this point . newline newline  thanks , i found it under the bed . i can show you where after you lead me up there .  the sentence ended on a much high note than it started . newline newline  no thanks .  barely a whisper . newline newline  what ?  newline newline  i m not a lesbian .  newline newline  so ? neither am i , it s not gay if you re having sex with yourself .  newline newline  i m not attracted to you .  newline newline  oh , it s the eye patch is nt it . here .  she tore the eye patch away . now she looked just like me but with more of a libido . newline newline  no , it s not the eye patch .  newline newline  low selfesteem ? i know i ve dealt with that in the past  newline newline  is there a return to sender or  newline newline  and i learned to love myself .  newline newline  am i stuck with this ?  newline newline  pardon ?  newline newline  you should leave .  newline newline  oh .  newline newline  yeah .  newline newline  i really thought i d be coming rather than going .  newline newline  yeah .  newline newline  you know , it s not a crime to love yourself .  newline newline  i ll remember that .  newline newline  i ll keep in touch .  newline newline she left the coffin that day . i did nt move it before i saw her again . newline newline  oh , you still have it ?  she said , as enthusiastic as usual . newline newline  yeah .  newline newline  so are we going to have sex or ...  newline newline  no . i have some questions that i need to ask you .  newline newline  what kind of questions ?  newline newline  it s the sort of thing i do nt really feel comfortable telling other people . i figure you re a good place to start .  newline newline  well i am you .  newline newline  you dealt with  newline newline  the crippling loneliness ? yeah , ever since i left college . why ?  newline newline  how ?  newline newline  how what ?  newline newline  how d you deal with it ?  newline newline  oh . drugs , mostly .  newline newline  did that work ?  newline newline  care to find out ?  newline newline we spent the rest of that afternoon huffing sharpie . it worked for a while , but at the end of the day i still felt like shit . the other me , who handled the high much better than myself , slept on the couch that night . before she passed out she said ,  did it work ?  newline newline  not really .  newline newline  never did for me either .  newline newline  why d you wear that eyepatch the first time you came ?  newline newline  i thought you d like it . did you ?  newline newline  it s the thought that counts .  newline newline we went out for breakfast the next day , and she slept over again . it continued like that for a while . months went by . newline newline  do you ever have to go home ?  newline newline  i made sure the neighbor would feed the cat .  newline newline  good .  newline newline  i think i ll leave once we lose our virginity .  newline newline  i think i ll keep putting that off .  newline newline and so on it went . a lot of you guys thought we were twins . a few of you knew . i am happy to see so many smiling faces gathered in out backyard to see her laid to rest with the garden she brought back to life . she may have died a virgin , but she died my best friend . how long have you been working here ?  newline newline  it s been about a year and a half now , i think .  newline sometimes you do nt realize how much time flies until you look back at it . newline newline  were you always in this department ?  newline newline  yeah , why ?  newline newline  has the chief always been so ... cold ?  newline newline  hm ? i mean , i guess he s not as friendly as  newline newline  it s just that someone was talking to him in the hall , and he seemed so unfriendly .  newline for a new hire , timmy sure did nt seem to have much work to do . though that pile of papers on his desk was nt getting any smaller . newline newline  maybe he was in a bad mood  everyone gets those . you re not working directly with him anyway , so do nt get caught up in it .  i motioned to his stack of files .  did nt ms. ming say that you were supposed to get through those by today ?  newline newline  oh , right !  he turned back to his work , and i thought he was done . i had my own deadline to make .  it s just that ,  he turned back to me to say ,  everyone else has been super friendly so far , so i was just wondering .  newline    newline newline timmy chats a bit too much , but he s not the first to mention how different our section chief is . i noticed it when i first started as well . the chief always has this stern look on his face , and his remarks are always short and tothepoint , like he does nt have time to waste . it never felt particularly unfriendly to me though . he was just a busy guy . newline newline it was nt until i started hearing people complaining during lunch , about how much harder our section has to work , that i wondered if maybe our section did have things worse . people kept saying how we would always have to redo our reports multiple times , how their presentations were never good enough . everyone company has people like that , i thought . they probably just did nt work hard enough . newline newline but then i started getting nearly every report back to redo . i got assignments where i d have to work on my day off . i started noticing how friendly the other section chiefs were , how relaxing their work looked . and i started getting tired of staying late so many days to finish my work . newline    newline newline once , i fell asleep in the office and did nt wake up until morning . i do nt think i even finished the report i was working on , but i really needed to stretch my arms and legs a bit . i d never been , but i decided to head up to the building rooftop for some air . the sight was nt anything really beautiful , just a bunch of buildings really . there was a bit of a clearing in one direction , towards the park . newline newline  what are you doing here so early ?  i heard behind . i turned and saw the chief sitting on a bench , welldressed and groomed , looking ready for another day . newline newline not moving from my spot , i said ,  oh , sir . i was getting some air .  newline newline  this early ? at work ?  newline newline  oh , ah , right ,  i stumbled .  i was finishing some work and fell asleep last night .  newline newline  why did nt you just take your work home ? it s nice to wake up at home .  newline newline i hated taking work home . i did my work at work . and besides , there s not really anyone waiting up for me at home . i was still living with my parents at the time , and they were always working at their store until late . then they were out early in the morning again too . newline i think i said something to that effect at the time . newline newline and then , i said ,  well sir , are nt you always at the office working too ?  newline newline he stayed silent , like he did nt care to continue the small talk . newline newline i d gotten my fresh air , so i decided to head back to the office .  i ll be going then , sir ,  i said , and he did nt respond . newline newline as i passed by him , i noticed that his face looked a bit more haggard than i expected . and there was an opened box next to him with a small , very brightlycolored painting sitting inside . it was some kind of bird , and it looked beautiful . newline newline i guess he caught me looking , because he said ,  my daughter painted it . she s only 13 , but would nt you think a professional artist painted this ?  and then a brief smile flashed across his face , before it went blank again . newline newline i did nt even know he had a daughter . he was always at work from what i saw and heard . he d never taken a vacation in his 8 years with the company . his desk did nt have any photos of family or anything , so i d always assumed he lived alone . i started wondering why he was always at work , with people waiting for him . newline newline i sat down on the bench beside his . newline  sir , why are you always at work ?  newline newline  ah ... well , that s what i live to do ,  he said matteroffactly . newline newline  why do nt you go on vacation ? with your family maybe .  newline newline  oh , i m sure she s having tons of fun with her mother and her friends . our schedules never quite work out , you know . and there s always work to do .  with that , he got up .  time to get back to it , is nt it ?  he took his box and headed down . newline    newline newline i ran into ms. ming on my way off the elevator . she was something like the department s head secretary , and i came to find out that she was usually the first person to the office  well , after the chief anyway . newline newline  what are you doing here so early ?  she asked . newline newline  i slept here last night .  newline newline  where are you coming from ?  newline newline  oh , the roof .  newline newline  is nt it nice up there ! i used to go there in the mornings when i was stressed out , when i was new , you know .  she paused briefly ,  did you see the chief up there ?  newline newline  yeah , that was a surprise .  newline newline  did you see the painting his daughter sent him ? was nt it just beautiful ?  newline newline  yeah , it  newline newline  you know , sometimes i feel so bad for him . everyone s always badmouthing him , but if your loved ones were thousands of miles away and all you had was work , how would you feel . you know ?  newline newline  thousands of miles away ?  newline newline  oh yeah . his daughter is studying abroad , and his wife went with her .  newline    newline newline i let ms. ming get back to work , but i wanted to ask her more . she was the friendliest of the staff , and she somehow managed to get all her work done and watch out for use newbies . she might not have known more than she said though anyway . newline newline after getting that peak of the chief s life , i wanted to know more . it really was nt any of my business though , and i doubt the chief wanted anyone else in his personal affairs . i thought about it much less as things at work continued to move like clockwork . but when i saw the chief from then on , i saw more than just sternness on his face .dave mahone stood there as sarah tridun pounded her fists into his chest , crying . he wasn  t sure quite how he got here , but he knew what was about to happen next . he had tried stepping back before , and that didn  t end well . she had fallen and broken her nose , then called nine one one and reported him for punching her in the face . he was lucky they were in a public place , another couple had seen that and when the cops arrived gave statements counteracting her lie . he had once tried grabbing her arms but that had landed him in jail for the night . so he just stood there and braced himself for the change in tactics that were about to come . newline pain flared in his chest as her fists were opened up and she clawed at his chest with her recently manicured nail . his blood was undistinguishable against her red painted nails . he took a step back and brought one of his arms up to protect his chest . looking down at her he caught her vindictive smile . the one she wore when she had some something especially mean to someone . dave turned to walk away when he heard her . newline  don  t think about going anywhere . i  m not done with you.  she screeched at him . newline he flinched . how he would love to leave or hit her , to stop her treating him like this , but he was always taught hitting a lady was disrespectful and no man would ever hit a lady , and there were other reasons now as well . he thought back to how he met sarah . newline back then when their relationship first started she seemed so interesting to him and she seemed really interested in him as well . it was two weeks after he proposed to her that her true colors made their first appearance . she had asked him about something small , he wasn  t sure exactly what it was now . but then he saw her vicious smile as she bumped him knocking him off balance and down the stairs at the hotel . newline he knew what would happen if he tensed up so he with a lot of effort kept himself loose and only suffered some bruising and a sprained ankle . everyone except him thought it was an accident . she started off after that subtly , but he always knew because of that smile . he tried to break it off and she pulled the stick out trapping him in the cage he was in now . all with a single sentence ,  i  m pregnant.  newline back in the present , with her vicious smile on him he grabbed his keys and left . he needed somewhere safe to spend the night . after an hours driving , he pulled up to a truck stop to get some food , and some medical supplies to clean the claw marks on his chest . he got out and some of the truck drivers smiled and gave him thumbs up . he mentally groaned , they thought those were from him being good in bed . he thought about the fact that there was no men  s house for men abused to stay at . walking in he thought about how almost every injury she gave him could be easily rationalized away as an accident or something he should be bragging to his friends about , he also doubt that even if there he could stay there . but he wasn  t completely beaten , not yet , there was still hope . he knew a lawyer . newline ron ... ulysses ... swanson , are you ready ?  newline newline the newly elected human representative s legendary mustache quivered with a ferocity . newline newline  this forced kidnapping is a very serious violation of my rights , which is only surpassed by your cavalier attitude to my right to not say my middle name .  newline newline the pink tentacle ... . thing smacked the ceromonial horn on the plasma table .  swanson you are here to cast vote on the building of a new community centre in your sol system . we require humanity s input . so , what say you ?  newline newline  no .  ron responded in a voice that would have made god cancel the apocalypse . newline newline  you are against building of the rec . center ?  the blue floating orb asked him . newline newline  i am against this entire committee of bureaucrats that wish to flush public money in the building of an expensive and ultimately useless homage to luxury .  the sound of his ceromonial gavel echoed throughout the room , which brought his attention to the extremely wellcrafted table . newline newline  uh ... . on a side note , what is this wood ?  the smooth surface and pearly finish made his hands tingle with joy . newline newline  thats marlov bark , from my home planet .  the blue orb responded . newline newline  so its a tree or ...  newline newline  no marlovs are wild creatures that breed like rabbits . this material grows on their bark . it s skinned off after the hunter strips away the meat .  newline newline the mustache quivering was now accompanied with a twinkle in ron s eyes .  meat you say ?  newline newline  yes . quite delicious actually . you remember that purple slab from lunch you had 10 helpings of  newline newline ron s chair fell backward as he jumped up .  that beautiful ... .. sustenance came from this ... marklov ?  newline newline  uh , yes .  newline newline ron banged the gavel with a penchant .  new point of order . i vote an immediate import of this marklov onto earth so that i.. we humans can enjoy its many bounties .  newline newline he leaned towards the blue orb and whispered .  also i would like to buy a piece of land on your planet with plenty of game . how much gold would it cost to buy an isolated piece of beautiful land where i can hunt , grill and build ?  newline newline the tentacle started to quiver with frustration .  mr swanson please , we need to focus . this rec centre  newline newline ron s raised hand made the tentacle stop midflow . he followed this by staring intently at the pink tentacle in complete silence . newline newline  um ... .  the blue orb tried to talk , tasted the room and wisely shut up . newline newline  i do nt like you .  ron said quietly . newline newline  i beg your pardon ?  the pink tentacle quivered . newline newline  what s your name ?  ron asked with the expression of an ice covered mountain peak . newline newline  taxxrrmmrrytrif ... .  newline newline ron eyes narrowed . newline newline  but my friends call me tammy for short . you are very welcome to call me that , if you like .  the pink tentacle said while twisting into a sexy pose  for her people  . newline

of the room is a lengthy , oblong table at which a half of the dozen seats are filled by sober looking men in suits , all staring at scott , 33 , pale , freckly , wearing a chef s hat . newline newline scott glances around at them . he smiles . newline newline stensworth newline my name is stenworth . do you know why newline you re here scott ? newline newline scott newline no ! i thought  they told me we were flying newline to trenton , new jersey . newline newline stensworth newline of course they did . security reasons . precautionary . newline newline stensworth is the oldest of the

ready to unveil newline my equipment . i was super excited . newline newline stensworth newline yes . you re equipment . we certainly do nt want that newline unveiled on public television , if ever . newline newline stensworth pauses to light himself a cigarette . he extends the pack to scott , who is at the opposite end of the table , far out of reach . newline newline scott newline oh no thank you . newline newline stensworth newline they call you the chef . newline newline scott newline well , chef scott . it has a nice ring i think . newline newline stensworth newline is that the reason for the hat ? newline newline scott sets the hat down . newline newline scott newline it s just a gimmick , i do nt know . newline newline stensworth newline you re going to do your country a great service scott . newline we want you to work for us . we d of course provide newline housing , an assumed name and identification , protection newline services ... of course a highly qualified team at

newline up , take a second to think about the thousands , tens of newline thousands of troops that are relying on this country s top newline scientific minds to save their lives . newline newline he forcefully puffs out smoke , almost in emphasis of his point . newline newline stensworth newline relying on you , scott . newline newline scott newline to do what ? newline newline stensworth newline let s see what s in the briefcase . newline newline scott newline what do you want with it ? it s just meant to expedite newline the searing process . you ca nt use it in combat . newline newline stensworth newline we ll be the judge of that , soldier . show us the device . newline newline scott newline i ca nt , i have a contract with the food network  newline newline stensworth newline i m

newline this is unconstitutional ! newline newline stensworth newline no more games chef ! we know who you are , we ve got newline a whole dossier on you . you ca nt go around selling newline advanced

newline stuff . newline newline stensworth newline boys . newline newline the other suits get up and make for scott . scott , reacting on complete instinct , jumps out of his seat with a spatula in one hand and an electric egg beater in the other . newline newline he slightly twists the spatula handle and the business end becomes visibly red with heat . he presses a button and the egg beater whizzes at a mind numbing speed . newline newline scott newline  sotto  newline how do you get yourself into this shit scott ? newline newlineas he opened his eyes when the blinding red light came and realized it was time to go back to work . yet another exciting day in level 11 hell . the worst part , he had done this to himself , this was a punishment from corporate for his drug use . normally the powers at be dont mind when you use drugs from the game to have a little fun , but he was drinking on top of the drug use and damn near burnt headquarters to the ground . newline newline they couldnt fire him , he was the face of the company . mario was know by kids from around the world and word could not get out about his out of game drug use . so his punishment , to restart at 11 every single day , until the player takes him all the way through the game without using a single mushroom or star the entire game . while this was already bad enough , the player was a 5 year old american kid . newline newline when he woke up to the blazing red light coming through his window he told himself ,  today is going to be the day i get out of this hell . if i can guide the player to the top of the screen and run across the top of the maps we can do this , and i can use the warp tubes to get to the higher levels easier .  newline newline and that is what he did . i mean come on , the kid was still only 8 and , lets face it , not the brightest bulb in the box . 3 years of this crap was enough , he was done with this and wanted out of his prison hell . newline newline that day is when it all went horribly wrong for mario . the first level was hell to get through without the kid using a mushroom or a star . every time he felt the rush of the mushroom mario threw himself into the nearest hole to force a restart of the level . 10 times this happened but eventually he won , the kid was frustrated with the level and did a speed run to 12 . newline newline this was when mario could shine , kid went up to get a magic life mushroom and mario flung his body in a way that missed the mushroom but he was now literally on top of the world . he started running towards the warp tubes as fast as he could and was so excited he forgot to pay attention to his player . his player was no longer using the controller , he looked out the screen at the kid and saw the kid pulling an adult into to the room to show them what he just did . mario stopped but it was too late , the adult had seen him moving without the kid using the controller . newline newline  honey , does the game always do that ?  newline newline  what do you mean mom  newline newline  does the controller work ?  newline newline  most of the time but sometimes it glitches and he doesnt move or moves too fast . the jump button doesnt always work but its ok , its only on this game and none of my other games .  newline newline  the game must be defective , we will take it back tomorrow and get a new copy that works properly  . newline newline in that moment both the player and his mom thought they heard a faint scream come from the tv but agreed it was probably his sisters tv upstairs . in reality mario knew his fate was sealed , eternal damnation . the scream was his . this was his only chance , this game , this player , and this cartridge . if he didnt complete his sentence in this game he would be stuck forever . newline newline and for the next 30 years he laid trapped , inside his cartridge , level 11 his home , waiting for the red light to come back on . he had hated that light for 3 years but after 30 years of solitude his only wish was for its familiar glow to return beckoning him back to work . newline newline thats when it happened , he felt 3 giant gusts of wind and the red light came back on . he fell to his knees thankful to have a purpose again then lifted himself and stood proud for the player selection screen ready to play and redeem himself . newline newline that is when the gaming gods truly smiled on him , he saw the new player look at his friend and say  i bet i can beat the game without using mushrooms or stars .  newline          dropcap  newline newline blam .  newline newline as the muzzle flash went off , the men could see a figure standing atop a shelf in the far corner of the room , silhouetted in black and light . it wore a hoodie and jeans , and its hand was up , with the revolver above its head the way the statue of liberty held its torch . the message was clear : a warning shot . leave now while you have the chance .  newline newline lights were flung in its direction , but it was gone as quickly as it had appeared . newline newline  find her !  dominic whisked his hands in the air in a panic .  i want to see her body full of bullets before we leave with the shipment . the rest of you , hurry up . i want this done yesterday .  newline newline six men carrying assault rifles spread out and headed for the source of the gunshot . dominic turned his back to them reluctantly , his hand fingering the gun held in the holster on his side . he watched as the rest of his men stepped out of the semitrailer to load more boxes of identical rifles . he could nt think . newline newline another gunshot went off . the same type as before . his hands gripped tighter on the gun as he whirled to face the sound . he saw nothing  his view was blocked by the dozens of shelves of contraband weapons . heaven help him if she opened up something more dangerous than her pistol . he tried not to think about it . newline newline he was sweating through his suit . the bulletproof vest underneath was nt enough of a comfort to him . she had been through more than half a dozen warehouses like this one and had torn through them like they were wet paper . the only ones to make it out were the ones who ran . the cowards . newline newline a light went off in his mind , and he turned to see four of his men running out through the loading dock . for a moment , his fear was eclipsed by impatience . then whole rounds of fire from the assault rifles sounded from the far reaches of the facility . he turned to the rest of his men . newline newline  move it !   dominic attempted to snap his fingers , but the gun was in his hands . how had the gun gotten in his hands ? nevermind , he obviously needed it .  they have her dead to rights . finish loading the truck so we can leave !   newline newline this was punctuated by another revolver shot , followed by the sound of a man screaming in pain . the men decided to leave without loading the rest of the cargo . newline newline  come back here !  dominic pointed his gun at the exit , but the men skirted around the corner where he could nt see them . another blast of rifle fire tore through the metal shelves behind him . he turned again . newline newline a light fixture shattered above him . he shielded his eyes . when he looked up again , he saw someone running straight in his direction . dominic had his hands up and ready to fire before he realized it was one of his own . just as the man reached him , an explosion rocked the building . the fireball spread , setting off various other weapons on the west side of the warehouse . newline newline  sir , we need to go . it s not safe here .  newline newline  i am not leaving .  dominic s hands shook .  we must make sure the girl is dead .  newline newline  the explosion would have killed her for sure  newline newline a shot from the revolver passed through the man s skull as he spoke . he died instantly . newline newline dominic was left standing in the middle of a rapidly disintegrating storage facility , completely and totally alone . his nerves could nt have been more shot if he had been shot himself . in the midst of his panic , he thought he heard snippets of deranged laughter from behind the flames . newline newline  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...   newline newline he spun around and fired in the direction of the laughter . nothing happened . the fire continued to set off stray rounds of ammunition , which disoriented him and made it difficult to tell where the laughter came from . a stray bullet passed mere inches from his face , and he turned again and fired blindly . newline newline  dominic ? is that you ?   now the voice was louder , and closer , and it took on a strange singsong quality . dominic briefly entertained the notion that he might already be dead and in hell . he turned , but did nt fire , wildly shaking as he looked back and forth through the flames . newline newline  it is you !   newline newline the voice was directly behind him . newline newline dominic turned and fired four rounds directly into the girl s stomach . she dropped to her knees , then sprawled out on the floor . a pool of blood gushed out from under her . dominic squeezed the trigger again , but the gun was empty . newline newline he stumbled slightly , then got his balance . the girl was lying between him and the loading dock . with the outofcontrol fire raging behind him , it was the only exit left in the building . keeping his gun pointed at the girl , he took a single , hesitant step toward the door . newline newline almost as if on cue , the girl lifted her hand and planted it on the floor . dominic screamed , nearly fainting as she lifted herself up , bracing against the truck until she came to her full height . she was laughing in a rage , coughing up blood as she began to take zombielike steps toward the cartel boss . newline newline  it s been so long since i saw you last .   newline newline  how are you not dead ?  dominic yelled . he dropped the gun . his hands were trembling like jackhammers as he walked backwards away from the girl . newline newline  do you remember me , dominic ? do you remember killing my family ?   newline newline  how are you not dead ?  he yelled again . he tripped then , over a box of guns carelessly flung aside as his workers made their escape . the girl reached him , standing on the box and pointing her revolver at his head . newline newline  there are so many drugs running through my system . i am riding on a high like you would nt believe .   she looked down at the bullet holes punched through her tshirt .  i do nt feel a thing .   newline newline the fire was sweeping dangerously close to the semitrailer . dominic watched the girl as she stepped down from the box . newline newline  kill me now and be done with it , please . i m begging you .  newline newline  i m not here to kill you , dominic . you re going to have your entire life to pay for what you did . i might tie you down , torture you for hours , make you wish you were dead . but you re going to live a good , long life .   newline newline the girl shot dominic in the knee . he howled in pain as she grabbed him by the collar and dragged him toward the loading dock . newline newline  if you stay alive for no other reason , do it for spite ,   the girl said .  it works for me .  dear mom and dad , newline newline hey guys , sorry it s been so long since i wrote . i know that i promised last time that i would write more , but things have just come up . i know that s a lame excuse , but it is true ... i guess i should explain . newline newline so i have nt been completely honest with you guys . i ve been trying to hard to do this in person , but i feel like i ca nt keep it in anymore . mom , dad , chloe and i are dating . newline newline i know . i know . this is so sudden , and such a horrible way to tell you that your daughter is probably gay or something , but i ca nt keep it inside anymore . i ve been trying to hard to come visit , but chloe is dragging me all around the country , showing me things i ve never imagined . guys , it s been so beautiful . newline newline i ve seen the lights of vegas , the skyscrapers of new york city , hollywood , san fransisco , and more rock shows than i ve ever thought possible . to be honest , i ve never been happier . newline newline chloe has shown me so many beautiful thing besides the county , she s shown me complete happiness . i know i ve told you about the storm , about how chloe saved me from it , but guys , she s saved me from so much more . she s the most caring , loving , wonderful girlfriend i could ever have . she s there for me constantly , whenever i need it , never asking me for anything in return . i ve never known what it meant to love someone like you two do , but now i know . just do me a favor and never tell anyone i said she s like that . got ta keep up that punk persona . newline newline but anyway , punk rock shows are just exactly how you d picture them , just not quite as violent . there s still the horrible smells , the crazy hair , and the dark lighting of the bar , but the music and atmosphere is usually very inviting and fun ! oh , and yes , i m going to bars now . do nt worry though , i still ca nt stand the taste of alcohol , so whenever i can convince chloe to let me pass on drinking , i pass . it s not often that gets to happen though , sadly , and punk clubs do nt offer any girly drinks  as my girlfriend so puts it . but anyway , i promise i m not being completely irresponsible , just trying to feel as alive as i can out there , but honestly , chloe can not be the greatest influence on that . but i promise you i m safe , and i promise you that i m happy for the first time in a long time . newline newline so anyway , i promise you that this time i will write more often , and i plan to keep it . i also promise to be home very soon . i know i ve sent you a few photos of chloe and i , but you guys need to see her in person to believe it . i promise to bring home my first date soon so you can meet her dad  i know this is nt exactly the way you invisioned it , but at least you wo nt have to worry about some boy taking advantage of me . just chloe  . newline newline love you guys and see you soon , maxphysical attributes : this race is most similar to earth s jellyfish . they are dome shaped and have a body made of semiporous rock encompassing a flexible membrane .  imagine drifblim from pokemon had a kid with the thing  these beings do not have eyes or any form of sensory organ similar to earth creatures . they inhabit a gas giant planet , similar to jupiter , and communicate using electrical impulses that travel through the gasses that encompass the surface of the planet . newline despite sounding like rather primitive beings , they are able to communicate wholly and have developed a monarchylike society in which a select few govern over the rest . newline newline technology is in the form of circuits and is controlled in a manner similar to telepathy . as these beings use electrical pulses to communicate , they use these pulses to activate circuits in their machines and control them with their  mind   quotes around mind as our concept of consciousness may be vastly different to theirs  . newline newline currently they are having a goodol  existential crisis . it seems that metal and machine components have been pulled in by their planet s gravitational pull . they can activate them , but they do not function in the same manner or for the same purpose as the machines they are accustomed to using . one machine seems to make an extension of the device rotate , they suspect it may be used for movement . another piece emits a tone , they can not hear the tone , but can feel the waves pushing through their electrical pulses and through the gas around them . it repeats a pattern : . . .    . . . , . . .    . . . , . . .    . . . newline newline as the monarch is unsure of these items  origin , it is decreed they are an attempt to make the monarch seem foolish and are scrapped . scholars believe them to be from extraplanetary beings , but are skeptical of the existence of anything beyond the great gaseous ocean that fills their sky .prologue newline newline the word fell lightly upon my ears . soil .  the substance my grandfather spoke apparently was the key to a world below . supposedly feeding and nurturing billions of calm beings that moved with the wind and other natural things . newline he spoke of massive creatures that towered tall , and swayed with a soothing peaceful swishing . beautiful white grounds touched by breathtaking bodies of water . so much of it that more beings lived in the water than above . newline newline  nice story grandpa , now tell me something real !  i proclaimed . newline newline laughing , he rubbed my head .  but it is !  newline newline  nice try grandpa !  i insisted to hear a more real subject , perhaps more about our reach toward the blackness of the sky . newline newline  but erin , do nt you see ? there are living things . blue , green . red , yellow . all the colors of the world are at our feet this very moment .  he smiled amusingly at me . newline newline it took several seconds before i gave in .  tell me more then grandpa ,  i said sighingly , halfeager to hear of more stories below . newline newline  well , there are castles built by the earth that tower hundreds of thousands of feet into the air  their tops covered in white ice .  newline newline  oh geeeeeez grandpa , what else ?  i rolled my eyes . newline newline  streams of water ,  he outstretched his arms as wide as he could ,  stretching for miles that can carry you from one side of the earth to the other !  newline newline  no , way , grandpa . grandma , is he for real ?  i pleaded for grandma to make grandpa cease from telling such lies . newline newline she looked happily to me with a sparkle in her eyes .  perhaps you should see for yourself . the young male approaches the female . his anxiety is palpable , the sharp tang of pubescent sweat hanging around him . as he approaches , she catches a strong whiff , but tries to pretend she does nt notice . she fails . newline newline  so , uh , stacy ...  he stumbles over his words . the pressure of wooing a potential mate is catching up to him .  i was wondering if you d like to uh ...  newline newline the female purses her lips , a sign of displeasure . his hesitation is hurting his chances . if he is nt careful , his courtship will fail and he will need to seek a copulatory partner elsewhere . another bead of sweat runs down his acneriddled forehead . he is getting even more nervous . newline newline  what , mark ?  she says impatiently . she is getting impatient . the male s incompetence is simultaneously irritating and pityinducing to the female . she will hear him out for just a little longer . newline newline  would you ... like to ... go get a milkshake with me ?  he freezes , anticipation tensing his gangly teenage body . newline newline  uhh , i have a boyfriend . sorry .  she is not sorry . newline newline  oh , okay . sorry for bothering you . have a nice day , stacy .  newline newline  you too , mark .  newline newline the female walks away , laughing into her hands . the lonely male s search for a viable mate continues .first entry : newline february 23rd . newline newline it s all so exciting ! i ca nt describe how excited i am ! we all are ! finally , we ll show those kaldorian barbarians who s boss ! my brothers and sister in arms and i will stand against the unwashed hordes and protect glorious jakka to the last breath ! newline newline as i m writing this , we are shipping out of moldvar harbour . destination : the royal fleet off the shore of kaldoria . kollo has a buddy in logistics , and he says we ll spearhead a beach attack ! how exciting ! i have written many letters to my family back home . i have not heard back yet from my sister , but i m sure she s kicking ass on the frontline as i write ! our squad leader is speaking now , so i ll resume writing tomorrow ! for the glory of jakka ! newline newline last entry : newline january 15th : newline newline lisa is dead . her helicopter has been shot down while the army was retreating from oozar . or what is left of oozar . i do nt really care either way . my sister is dead . how am i supposed to tell mother ? that we re all that s left of our family ? how am i supposed to tell her ? newline newline there are talks of peace with the kaldorians . rumors mostly . someone knows someone who s friends with someone who s in the diplomatic corps . apparently our guys and theirs are meeting in a few days to negotiate a ceasefire . newline newline i do nt think i ll write again in this thing . it has helped me get through some of the hardest things i ever had to face in my life . newline newline the destruction of moldvar . the sacking of kaldor city . the slaughter of hill 157 . newline newline writing has helped me . but now , nothing can help me anymore . writing was my lifeline , my safety in the ocean of war . but what good is a lifeline if the ship is sinking ? newline newline looking back on one year in hell , i want to cry . nobody i m currently with was with me when i shipped out . all those people , all those faces , lost , burned , beaten , slashed , killed . wasted . coal for the fires of war . newline newline i do not know what the future holds . maybe we ll have peace with the kaldo s . maybe not . i do nt care either way . newline newline i think i ll end it on my terms . maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow . but there is no way i m coming back from this . newline newline i d rather end it on my own terms . nothing is forever ,  i said , then considered , rubbing my chin .  except for plastic , that  s never going away.  newline newline  i thought that was diamonds , bogdan.  newline newline  swine !  i mumbled .  public education has failed you.  i realized i was still rubbing my chin . i thought about stopping , then decided i liked it .  but the point is , this system is unsustainable . we  re talking imminent collapse here !  i thrust myself out of the chair and collided with a lingering cloud of weed smoke . i collapsed back in the chair , coughing . newline newline luke regarded all of this with an admirable calm , as if he wasn  t responsible for the fumes . abominable slug . polluting me on the day of my grandfather  s funeral ! and after the day i  ve had ! he waited for my fit to subside , then passed the bowl back to me . i glared at it , then at him , then back at the bowl .  it hasn  t gotten any better , has it ?  i asked hopefully . newline newline  absolutely not ,  luke agreed . newline newline i took the bowl and lit it , immediately choking . newline newline luke was a cheapskate . i should never let him buy the weed . newline newline while i was writhing in the chair , trying not to expel a lung , luke plucked the bowl from my hands .  so ,  he said ,  plastics are forever ?  newline newline  that  s your takeaway ?  i said weakly , struggling to catch my breath .  no . look , we gave it a good run . like , as a species . but nothing is forever , you know ?  newline newline  except for plastics.  newline newline  listen here , you little shit ,  i began , before being overwhelmed by another coughing fit . i had to give luke credit . he was the only man in the world who could find weed that choked you after you toked .  you know what i mean . the planet  s getting too hot . the water  s getting too filthy . we  re all mad at each other . this is  i thought about saying  this is the end ,  but i knew that would prompt luke to start bellowing the doors , so instead i said ,  this is how it starts.  newline newline luke nodded wisely , opened his mouth , and belched . newline newline  indeed ,  i said . newline newline we repacked the bowl and lit one for my grandfather .  i almost forgot about the cheese .   https : www.reddit.comrthebrzezinskicyclecomments3xzkleentry1itcertainlywasahandsomecheese  newline  newline bogdan , luke , and the cheese can be found here at  rthebrzezinskicycle   https : www.reddit.comrthebrzezinskicycle  . it was neither fear nor awe that mankind felt at the arrival of the aliens . instead , in the specious conference room on the fourth floor of the un headquarters , a deep sense of embarrassment prevailed . world leaders had been filling in in awkward silence for the last several hours . it was a mark of how bad things were , that in a room full of politicians no one was talking . newline newline but all good things must come to an end . newline newline  i just do nt see why we all had to come ,  the french president complained ,  it s been years since france has been in a war .  newline newline  right , your troops in africa are just there on holiday ,  the british pm chimed in . newline newline  that s peacekeeping !  newline newline  see this is just what the aliens mean when they say humans are violent . you send armies of men into other countries and ask them to be grateful .  the russians had joined the conversation . newline newline  well , no one would ever look to russia to keep the peace ,  snarled the someone from eastern europe . but not too loudly . newline newline  please everyone , we are acting like children . the aliens already think we are terrible . let us at least remain cordial until they arrive . perhaps we can prove their initial judgements of us wrong .  america was attempting to achieve global consensuses . maybe this time it would work . newline newline  and france at least wait to find out their names before surrendering .  nope still america . newline newline the chinese president  or maybe premier  decided his moment for conversational greatness had come . he had spent years balancing an economic alliance with the us with a policy of increased chinese prominence on the world stage , and now his diplomatic mastery told him just what to do . newline newline  hegemonicimperialistsayswhat  newline newline  what ?  the bewildered american responded . newline newline it was a great victory , confirmed in the laughter around the table . newline newline  i m sorry to interrupt .  everyone groaned at canada ,  but should nt we be discussing what to say to the aliens .  newline newline the awkward silence returned . everyone felt like they had just made a joke and no one had laughed . worse it had been a racist joke . newline newline  fuck these guys ,  america again .  who shows up at someone s house and starts with i need your help because you are so awful .  it s rude .  newline newline  seriously ,  the russian agreed ,  it s like , do we even know you ? why are you here .  newline newline  fight your own battles if humanity is so shitty . we got ... .stuff to do .  britain s leader was getting the hang of this . newline newline  when they open that door , i m gon na tell them to go to hell .  america had regained her standing in the world . all was well . newline newline  me too !  china knew which way the wind was blowing . newline newline  just do nt let france talk ,  a voice from the far side of the room called out . newline newline  what the hell denmark , you got conquered too .  france was defensive , it was a nice change of pace . newline newline slowly but surely the mood of the room changed . gone was the awkwardness and embarrassment , in it s place was a universally held conviction . one that would guide mankind through this crisis and to its eventual destiny in the stars . one that would eventually be put into those famous words that today ring the seal of the empire of humanity :  yknow what , fuck you . you do nt even know me . who the hell are you to judge me ? think you are so high and mighty . well fucker whose got the nukes and whose got the nice ? that s what i thought . i did nt mean to become a god . really i did nt . most people would love to be a god , i however just want to invent and study the world . that s how i apparently became a god by the way , one of my experiments . newline newline it shredded my body and pumped ... energy ? into my body which elevated my ... soul ? i guess soul is the best word . it elevated my soul into god hood . i do nt know how i know i m a god or how i know how to use my new powers , or that i know i m in my own personal dimension , but i do . newline newline it s all black right now . pure black , no back ground radiation , nothing . just pure nothingness . it was maddening i needed light , so i made a star . it was nothing much just an average main sequence star . newline newline that as boring though , just a star spewing out light and energy so i made a massive rotating disk of dust around the star and spent millions of years watching the dust slowly collect into planets , and the planets destroy each other then recollect before they finally all had stable orbits . newline newline once they where all stable everything was boring again so i looked at some of the planets and found some with complex chemicals on it , so i genitally nudged some of the chemicals to start the process of becoming life . newline newline i then spent millions of years watching life evolve into new and complex things but eventually even that got boring so i looked that the smartest creature on my planet and nudged them into sentience . for another million years i watched the civilization slowly build themselves up and push the limits i put into the world . however after a while even that became boring . so i pushed the people in ways that will help them reach the technological level i was at when i became a god . newline newline for thousands of years i watched them build technological monuments and push their bodies , but then one day i see one of my creations meditating . his soul starts to glow brighter and brighter and starts to shake and vibrate . soon it s glowing so bright and shaking so violently it s body shreds itself and the soul shoots out of my world punching a hole into my dimension . newline newline i guess there is more then one way to become a god .when among the living i wondered many times how life after death would be , would i reincarnate as a noble animal ? would i go to heaven or hell or would there just be nothing ? everything i imagined then is heaven compared to what actually is at the end of the tunnel . newline newline george snapped his fingers and woke me from my dead dreaming . newline newline   we have to get back to work   he snapped at me . newline   i d like to get this over with before he who can not be named returns   . newline newline i sprung to my feet and looked at the list he gave us . almost everything was crossed off , only the toughest ones remained . i looked down at my feet and remembered they weren  t there anymore . as we floated through the living world we kept on the lookout for a size 12 pair blood stained white stilettos , where the hell would we find that . everywhere we went , we never found anything above size 10 , let alone blood stained . newline newline it was late at night for the living , very few people were out and those who were were nt very sober . flashing blue  red lights bounced of the buildings at the intersection . when we got closer we saw emt s running
